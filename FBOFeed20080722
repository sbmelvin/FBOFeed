<CONTACT>Jacquelyn M. Fleet, Contract Specialist, Phone 315-330-3270, Email jacquelyn.fleet@rl.af.mil
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Servicer Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, with Citrix Systems, Inc., 851 West Cypress Creek Road, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33309-2009 for the purchase of Customized Citrix XenApp Platinum Edition x1 Multi Level Security  Enterprise Level Agreement License, Quantity 10,000.  The purchase of software will also include Citrix Preferred PLUS Software Technical Support Service (Period of Performance: One year; 24 x 7 coverage; assigned Technical Manager; 6 names; and 75 incidents).  The minimum essential requirements can be found in the attached excel spreadsheet.     

Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 511210.

Sole Source Justification:

The Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DODIIS) Trusted Workstation (DTW) enterprise requires the purchase of 10,000 Citrix XenApp Platinum Edition Multi Level Security Licenses.  The requirement is mission essential for the installation and deployment of DTW 4.0 into all Regional Service Centers (RSC) for DIA.  Currently, four of the five RSCs, use the Citric Presentation Server Enterprise with their DTW implementation.  Citrix Presentation Server Enterprise is the earlier version of XenApp used in previous DTW deployments.  DIA will not renew its existing Presentation Server Enterprise licenses because the XenApp edition has superseded the Presentation Server edition.  This procurement of the XenApp Platinum Edition licenses is being performed as a follow-on contract to the procurement of the Presentation Server Enterprise licenses because the XenApp edition replaces the Presentation edition for the DTW 4.0 deployment.  XenApp is the only software that has the unique specialized features required by DIA.  

Development of an equivalent product by the Government would be cost prohibitive and will not meet timelines required for DTW deployment.  Furthermore, DIA has mandated DTW to be fielded to all DODIIS sites with 100% desktop penetration.  This level of penetration can only be achieved by supporting all applications currently in use throughout the DODIIS which necessitates the use of Citrix XenApp Platinum Edition.  Failure to implement XenApp Platinum Edition to support the thin client device will require maintenance of an additional fat client baseline for non-conforming applications, effectively doubling the amount of desktop hardware, software, administration, and maintenance required throughout the DODIIS enterprise.

Citrix Systems, Inc. is the only source that can provide a product that offers the following Solaris client mission critical features on a thin client device required by DIA: Support for two-way Windows audio, Graphics acceleration that allows 3D graphics applications to display smoothly; Audit record and archive of user activity; and Application performance monitoring.  The Citrix XenApp Platinum Edition Multi Level Security license is the only product that satisfies all agency requirements, and Citrix Systems is the sole provider of the customized Citrix XenApp Platinum Edition.

<DESC>The following firms have made successful application for the A/E QVL for Facility Design in the Western Logistics Service Area:  Leo A Daly; MBB; WH Pacific; USKH, Inc.; DMJM H&N/AECOM; Mead & Hunt, Inc.; URS Corporation; and Davidson & Associates.
The QVL will be in effect for five (5) years (one base year plus four optional years).  After approximately one (1) year, a second SIR is planned for public announcement via the internet to allow new vendors an opportunity to apply for consideration to be added to the QVL.  At that time, existing vendors will be asked to confirm their continued interest to remain on the list, or opt out to the list, by responding in writing.  A non-response will be viewed as lack of interest resulting in possible removal from the QVL.  Also, vendors may submit a written request to withdraw from the list at any time.  
The FAA reserves the right to unilaterally add vendors or update the list at any time.  If it is ever determined that the QVL approach is not in the best interest of the FAA, all members on the list will be provided with advanced written notice that the QVL is being terminated.
Once established, the Contracting Officer (CO) will exclusively utilize the QVL for solicitations to the maximum extent possible.  Another advantage of being included on the QVL is the streamlined solicitation process.  Since technical evaluations will have already been established, generally only prices will need to be requested and evaluated for a specific requirement.  If it is determined a public solicitation is needed for a specific requirement, then eligible vendors on the QVL will be as well.  Depending on the size of the final list, the FAA reserves the right to rotate requirements among the vendors to ensure fair competition.  In any event, an incumbent contractor will always be given the opportunity to compete for any follow-on requirement solicited under the QVL.

<DESC>The US Forest Service, Chugach National Forest, intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Alutiiq Museum, Archaeological Repository, 215 Mission Road, Ste 101, Kodiak AK 99615, for the curation of an archaeological collection from former Forest lands on Afognak Island, within the Kodiak archipelago.  It is the Chugach National Forests desire to curate archaeological materials in a facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR 79, that is closest to the origin of the collection, and if possible, that is within the Alaska Native cultural area with which a collection is associated.  The Alaska Native descendants of the people who created the archaeological sites represented by this collection live in the Kodiak area.  The Alutiiq Museum, a part of the Alutiiq Heritage Foundation, is the only facility in the Kodiak Archipelago that meets the federal requirements for long-term curation of archaeological collections.  The number of facilities that meet 36 CFR 79 in Alaska are limited, several are not accepting new collections at this time, and all except the Alutiiq Museum are outside the cultural area of the collection.  Total estimated value of the purchase order is $37,668.  No request for proposal is available for competitive quoting, however, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement no later than 3 pm 6 Aug 2008.  The expected date the complete collection will be turned over is 1 September 2008.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is:  712110.  Point of contact for this requirement is Denise Murphy, denisemurphy@fs.fed.us or 907-743-9531.

<DESC>An FBO Notice was originally posted on February 29, 2008, for this same project.  The actual solicitation will be posted on July 23, 2008.

The Office of International Programs has a mandate to coordinate all international activities for the USDA Forest Service (USFS) around the world.  The office receives funds from Congress, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. State Department and other federal agencies, international and domestic cooperators and partners for the purpose of implementing projects which enhance cooperation between the USFS and other countries on practices and policy related to natural resources management, conservation, disaster mitigation and disaster response.

The objective of this program is to enhance cooperation on sustainable forestry, natural resource management, disaster mitigation and response between the USDA Forest Service and collaborating countries around the world.  In order to achieve this objective, the Office of International Programs requires 1) support in hiring personnel, located domestically or internationally, who are skilled in the required technical areas and 2) technical, administrative, and logistical support for implementing project operations overseas.  

Personnel may be required to be skilled in one or more areas of expertise depending on the project requirements. These areas may include, but are not necessarily limited to sustainable forestry, natural resources management, disaster mitigation and response, training and education, database management, writing and editing, and administrative specializations.  Personnel will be hired and support services will be sought on a demand-driven basis for both long-term and short-term projects.  Support services required may include: providing logistical and other support to personnel on overseas field assignments, including long-term assignments in countries with weak public infrastructure; the organization and implementation of meetings, training events and conferences in the U.S. and overseas; obtaining services, equipment; materials and shipping as necessary for the execution of overseas field activities and projects; and electronic fund transfers to implementing organizations on a reimbursable basis, as necessary.

The contract is an Indefinite Quantity-Indefinite Delivery type contract.  Task orders may be firm fixed price, labor-hour or time and materials.  There will be a base period with up to four option periods.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for implementation of the NASA Cryogenic FluidManagement (CFM)project sponsored research investigating venting and thermal prformanceof multi-layer insultion (MLI) blankets for cryogenic storage tanks during launch ascentby comparing the performane of a bounding case for maximum vacuum thermal performance buthighest risk for structural blanket damage (MLI blanket without perforations) to pervioustest dta from a perforated blanket in the same configuration.  NASA/GRC intends to obtain this service from Ball Aerospace Corporation as an additionaltask under an existing contract.This research task will require specialized test equipment, hardware fabrication, andmodeling capabilities including a vacuum system capable of simulating a launch ascentpressure profile on a cryogenic tank of reasonable scale, high-fidelity (flight-like) MLIblanket fabrication, existing fluid and thermal modeling capability for the MLI venting,and models for assessment of blanket structural integrity during venting. BATC haspre-existing unique hardware, data and models required to conduct this research. Theywill fabricate a flight-like 40 layer MLI blanket (vented only at the seems), apply theblanket to a relevant scale cryogenic tank, test through simulated ascent profiles, andprovide the government with a direct comparison of this new data to existing data for aperforated MLI blanket in the same setup. The existing BATC thermal and fluid dynamicmodels will be anchored to this new data and provided to the government.The research services sought through this directed research contract are available atreasonable cost only from the BATC, as it will build on the unique research hardware anddata previously developed at BATC under internal research and development (IRAD) funding.BATC previously constructed the facility required for conducting the tests for thiseffort and tested and analyzed the ascent venting performance of a perforated MLIblanket. The data from this prior test was used in the development of BATCs ascentventing MLI performance model and will be used for direct comparison to the performanceof the MLI blanket tested in this effort. This data is not otherwise available to thegovernment. BATC also has unique expertise in fabricating MLI blankets for flightcryogenic vessels (Space Shuttle PRSD tanks) that will be leveraged in this effort toensure development of a flight-like test article. The research services are deemed to be available only from the BATC which is in this caseconsidered a add-on effort to the  contract previously awarded as the Delivery andStorage of Cryogenic Propellants for Exploration Missions in which BATC applied theirMLI launch ascent venting model to analyze thermal performance and showed that the ascentventing portion of the mission could be a significant contributor to the overall thermalload on the propellants.  Seeking other than a sole-source procurement would causesubstantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recoveredthrough competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements anddeliverables under the IPP program.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfyagency requirements.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon August 1, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis, a study using real-time polymer chain reaction (PCR) to determine mtDNA mass from leukocyte and using PCR to detect mtDNA site-specific oxidative damage with Changhua Christian Hospital; Changhua, Taiwan.

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 the business size standard is 6.5 M employees.

The period of performance for this procurement is August 30, 2008 through August 29, 2009.  

The contractor shall analyze 1,700 DNA samples for mitochondrial DNA copy number and oxidative damage in several molecular epidemiologic studies. Normal cell mitochondria have between two and ten copies of their mtDNA genome and experimentally, cells challenged with Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may synthesize more copies of their mtDNA. The most common oxidative product of DNA is 8-OHdG, which is detectable in mtDNA of human tissue Cells. Under enhanced oxidative stress, the amount of 8-OHdG in mtDNA was found to increase. Human oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) can recognize 8-OHdG and catalyze the removal of 8-OHdG through cleavage of the phosphodiester bond in modified DNA. It has been shown that 8-OHdG is one of the important oxidative DNA lesions related to mitochondrial dysfunction and aging. If an 8-OHdG is present at a specific region of the DNA template, digestion of the 8-OHdG by hOGG1 can break the DNA template at the lesion site and block the amplification of this region by DNA Taq polymerase. Therefore, the greater the proportion of mtDNA in the samples contained 8-OHdG, the less intact mtDNA was left after hOGG1 digestion.

The lab in Vascular and Genomic Center in Changhua Christian Hospital was the first lab in the world and is the only source known to the NCI that to develop an assay method of mitochondrial mass and site-specific oxidative damage. This is a proprietary method and as such no other contractor can fulfill the requirements of this contract. The staff at The Vascular and Genomic Center are experts who have studied mitochondrial function for many years. They are knowledgeable about all aspects required and have the experience that is necessary. To maintain consistency of data, it is critical that the laboratory at The Vascular and Genomic Center be used to analyze the samples.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 a.m. ET on August 4, 2008. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Malinda Holdcraft: holdcram@exchange.nih.gov. It is the vendors responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid, updated registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). 
Please reference NCI-80135-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC><p>The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has a long history of translating scientific and technical developments into clinical practice. The Translational Medicine Branch of NHLBI consists of scientists and physicians with expertise in pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases together with a world class group of physical scientists specializing in the application of real time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) approaches to clinical sciences.  Despite the fact that NIH's reputation is well known, it does not as yet have a robust clinical MRI diagnosis and treatment program in children's cardiovascular/lung diseases. As a result the NHLBI is seeking to enter into a collaborative initiative with a local institution with extensive experience in the clinical diagnosis, treatment and management of children's cardiovascular and lung diseases. The primary goal is to develop a program to conduct investigational studies on the use of MRI in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in children. All patients recruited through the NHLBI for MRI study purposes would be followed/managed clinically by the contractor. The successful contractor will provide the day to day clinical management and care of all the patients. This would have to be accomplished through a successful pre-existing infrastructure including 24/7 physician and nurse coordinator availability in support of the MRI patient populations.  Patients referred to the contractor will be seen and evaluated at the contractor's facilities.   They will be given the option of enrollment in one of more of the collaborative NHLBI/contractor clinical trials.  Though it is envisioned that most clinical activity will occur at the contractor's facilities, some patients may be referred to the NIH Clinical Center for specialized studies.  The contractor's existing MRI facility will be critical to the program's needs.  The contractor must have a successful academic pediatric medicine program in the metropolitan District of Columbia region in order to allow patients to been at both locations.  This is not a request for proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. It is anticipated that an RFP detailing specifics of the project as well as information pertinent to the development of an offeror's proposal will be available on or about August 04, 2008.</p>

<DESC><p>This procurement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. NOAA, Marine Engineering Division located in Seattle, WA requires a contractor is to install components listed on the attached sheets into new cabinets that will be installed on board the ship at a later date.
<p>&nbsp;The equipment being installed is to provide automatic load control for all four ship's generators that will control both loading and unloading generators as appropriate when putting a generator on line or taking it off line to ensure that electrical loads are minimized during this process. The system is to work directly with existing ship's generators and primary electrical systems. Regulating instruments and transformers are to be replaced as required for proper load monitoring and control. Specifically, the modifications will include providing a Woodward AGLC control panel, logic circuits for relays, and revision of the current transformers that feed the existing load share modules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In order to provide proper load sharing between generators under any configuration for power generation, the new cabinets are to also incorporate new Basler DECS 200 digital voltage regulators. The work for the new regulators will include replacement of droop current transformers, replacing voltage feedback transformers to reduce feedback from 600 to 120 volts, and replacement of switchboard and console meters to provide operators with accurate and reliable monitoring information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The new digital regulator and load control components will be delivered at a later date to a location that has yet to be determined. The contractor will store completed cabinets at his facility until this information is available.</p>

Revision Changes:
 1.0	SCOPE1.1	Purpose:  The purpose of this document is to provide performance specifications for the competitive procurement of a Cold Wire-Feed Laser Processing Head for use in laser cladding operations.  It is the intent of this procurement to use commercial off the shelf (COTS) products that have already being designed and used in industrial environments.  
1.2	Intended Use:   The Cold Wire-Feed Laser Processing Head will be utilized at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (Division Keyport) by the Rapid Prototyping and Fabrication Department (Code 32).  The equipment shall be used primarily for cold wire-feed cladding for corrosion repair processes. 
1.3	 General Description:   Industrial laser processing operations require a laser processing head to properly focus, shape, monitor, and control the laser beam with respect to the work-piece during the specific operation.  This specification outlines the performance requirements of a laser processing head to perform cold wire-feed laser cladding at NUWC-Keyport.  The process of cold wire-feed cladding involves a wire metal filler material positioned into a focused laser beam and controlled with automated robotic positioning with respect to the work-piece.  Cold wire-feeding specifically refers to the fact that the wire is not provided any electrical current to assist in the melt process.  The only heat input is from the industrial laser source which is provided via fiber-optic delivery to the laser processing head.  The laser processing head consists of a cable receiver compatible with the specified industrial laser, working laser focusing and bending optics, mounting plate, visible laser focusing and bending optics for set-up.  This specification does not cover the automated robotic positioning system, the industrial laser, or the wire-feeding system.  
2.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS	ANSI Z136.1-1993  American National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers
3.0	REQUIREMENTSThe Cold Wire-Feed Laser Processing Head shall meet or exceed the following requirements:
3.1	Operating Environment:The system will be used in an industrial environment at Keyport, WA. Typical operation will be for short clads of less than 5 minutes in duration.  If needed it is acceptable for the vendor to integrate water cooling for the optics to handle the heat dissipation, however it is not a requirement.  
3.2	Cable Receiver Requirements:
3.2.1	Compatibility:  The cable receiver shall be compatible with an IPG YLR-5000 Continuous Wave (CW) 4kW Fiber laser with fiber-optic delivery.  The IPG laser operates at a wavelength of 1070-1080nm.  The cable receiver shall be compatible with a 600micron fiber-optic cable with QBH style connector.  The fiber-optic laser-beam half-angle divergence is approximately 0.1rad.  The optics shall provide a fixed focus laser standoff in accordance with the geometry specifications outlined in section 3.3.
3.3	Optics Geometry and Beam Shape & Size Requirements:  
3.3.1	Geometry:  The optics shall provide the working focused spot at 90 degrees from the incoming fiber-optic cable.  The overall maximum envelope dimensions of the unit are given in Figure 1.  The cold wire feed processing head shall fit within a 17.5 inch (444 mm) diameter cylinder when the spot size is at 4mm in the divergent zone of the beam.  Note the 15 degree off center angle of the optics when positioned inside the cylinder.  FIGURE 1: LASER PROCESSING HEAD ENVELOPE 
3.3.2	Dimensional Data: The vendor shall supply NUWC-Keyport with either a dimensional drawing of the entire cold wire feed processing assembly or part piece drawings of each item with the solicitation.  Drawings shall identify interface points (mechanical, fiber, etc).  In addition, the vendor can supply a CAD model, but it is not a requirement. 
3.3.3	Optical Parameters:  The optic components shall consist of approximately 50mm diameter optics with a focal length of approximately 150mm.  Working spot size is approximately 4mm in the divergent region of the beam. 
3.4	Visible Laser Optics Requirements:  The Cold Wire-Feed Laser Processing Head shall permit the transmission of the visible wavelength laser pointer (640-680nm wavelength) for positioning setup. 3.5	(Option) Camera System Requirements:  As an option the vendor shall provide a price for the inclusion on the Cold Wire-Feed Laser Processing Head a camera system that allows the operator to view the working area in-line with the optical path.  The camera system shall include a cross-hair generator for positioning the working focal spot with respect to the work-piece.  A price for this optional system is preferred, however it is acceptable for the vendor to no-bid this item.  If selected, the camera system shall come fully integrated on the cold wire feed processing head with applicable external viewing system included. 
3.6	Software/User Manual Requirements:  All necessary software shall be supplied to operate the system.  The software shall operate on MS Windows 2000 OS or MS Windows XP OS on a PC.  All necessary maintenance and operational manuals shall be provided.
3.7	Spares:  The vendor shall quote the following spare parts as an option:	Quantity 20 spare cover slides
4.0	Quality Assurance   The Cold Wire-feed Laser Processing Head equipment shall meet the following quality assurance requirements:
4.1	Installation & Verification Test:  A Verification Test shall be performed by NUWC technical representatives, which shall include the following:
4.1.1	Installation:  NUWC-Keyport personal will install the Cold Wire Feed Processing Head on NUWC-Keyports system (i.e. laser, fiber, chiller).  
4.1.2	Dimensional Envelope:  NUWC-Keyport personal will verify optics fit within the dimensional envelope as shown in Figure 1. 
4.1.3	(Option) Camera:  The camera system shall be evaluated for clear picture and stable and accurate cross-hair generator.
4.2	Final Acceptance:  A NUWC representative shall take final acceptance of the equipment after installation and verification testing has been completed.  Final acceptance shall not be made until the NUWC representative verifies that all testing performed in Section 4.1 meets all performance requirements in this specification.
4.3	Warranty:  The Cold Wire-Feed Laser Processing Head shall have a minimum of a 1 year warranty.
4.4	Delivery Schedule:  All components shall be delivered to NUWC-Keyport no later than 6 weeks from contract award.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.

<DESC><BR>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) has a requirement for re-competition of the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract, W9113M-05-A-0002. The existing contract is with Morgan Research Corporation. The requirement is to provide Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) consisting of non-personal support services for program management, planning, design, development, engineering, implementation, logistics, evaluation, sustainment, operations and support, acquisition, and ancillary services to PEO STRI and other U.S. Government agencies worldwide as well as state and local agencies.  The services will include related activities in support of all aspects of providing responsive integrated and interoperable infrastructure for Simulation, Training, Testing, and Instrumentation Solutions and Acquisition Services for the Warfighters and the Nation.  PEO STRI will award one performance-based Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQC) service contract allowing for the placement of Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Time and Materials (T&M) task orders with cost reimbursable line items for ODC and Travel. The contract will be for a five-year total period with a one-year base period and four one-year options to extend. The resultant contract will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that will limit the awardee from participating in any other PEO STRI contracts. There will NOT be a Draft RFP issued. Plan for a standard 30 day response time. Questions must be submitted within 10 days of RFP release. The formal RFP is expected to be released on or about 7 August 2008. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 with a small business size standard of $25 Mil for this acquisition.  The RFP will be 100 percent set-aside for small business and will therefore contain FAR clause 52.219-14. This pre-solicitation notice is for information purposes, does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for proposal costs. Comments and questions must be submitted in writing via e-mail to, Contracting Officer, Ms Christie P. Martinez at, christie.p.martinez@us.army.mil or to Ms Marnita Harris, Contract Specialist, marnita.harris@us.army.mil . The subject line for e-mail submission is SETA 2008 re-compete. Additional SETA documents are on the PEO STRI web site, https://portal.peostri.army.mil/sites/psg/newseta/default.aspx, listed on the left under SETA Draft Documents. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with the Strategic Applications International, on a sole source basis, engage facilitators to assist SAMHSA/CSAT with planning, implementing, and preparing the proceedings for Methamphetamine: The National Summit to Promote Public Health, Safety and Partnerships in Critically Affected Populations.   The period of performance will be from date of award through December 31, 2008.  The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  This procurement is under the Simplified Acquisition threshold and will be awarded as a Simplified Acquisition.    

SAMHSA/CSAT will utilize the Contractor to help plan all aspects of Methamphetamine: The National Summit to Promote Public Health, Safety and Partnerships in Critically Affected Populations at the Hilton Washington Hotel in Washington, DC.  In addition to planning activities (with significant SAMHSA/ CSAT involvement) the Contractor shall provide chief facilitation for the Summit, provide a summary report describing the successes and challenges of the conference, and recommend action plans for Federal agencies, States, and communities participating in the event based on data collected before and at the Summit.  SAMHSA/CSAT is partnering with all other DHHS Operating Divisions and components of the Office of the Secretary and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health that address methamphetamine, and the Department of Justices Office of Community-Oriented Policing Services (COPS), Office of Victims of Crime, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). The Contractor shall report back to the SAMHSA/CSAT Government Project Officer (GPO) on their responsibilities to develop collaborations for this conference with both public and private-sector organizations.  The conference will feature tracks covering the needs of methamphetamine-using Women, Criminal Justice (Incarcerated), and LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) individuals. Through plenary sessions, springboard presentations, and small discussion groups participants will learn about the latest innovations and developments related to research and services for methamphetamine-using individuals, as well as identify unmet needs.  Pre- and post-conference trainings on developing welcoming services environments for the critical populations being addressed will be offered.  Strategic Applications International (SAI) has developed and conducted over 20 Governors Statewide Summits on Methamphetamine since 2000, helping States to create comprehensive, integrated responses to the production, distribution and use of methamphetamine. SAI has refined the use of a model for these Governors Summits that fosters consensus, teamwork, commitment, and action from all State stakeholders.  

Strategic Applications International (SAI) is considered the only source because due to its experience and expertise is the only organization that can provide the services necessary in the time frame given.  

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as articulated above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation document is available.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability statements should be submitted by 12:00 pm August 4, 2008 to Rodney.Walters@psc.hhs.gov.

<a href="mailto:ceseley.dunbar@us.army.mil">Aviation Applied Technology Directorate</a>
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) anticipates award of a noncommercial program entitled, 'Composite Universal Weapons Pylon (CUWP) for the OH-58D Helicopter'.  This project will manufacture, test, and initiate qualification of a CUWP component for the Army helicopter OH-58D Kiowa Warrior.  This component is a direct replacement for the current metal UWP and maintains the same form, fit, and function.  The acquisition builds upon previously completed research and development conducted by Integrated Composites, Inc (ICI).  AATD anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis to ICI, who is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely capable of meeting this requirement.  The maximum value of the contract will be $9.8 million.  The contract minimum value of $1 million will be met with award of the first cost-plus-fixed-fee task order.  The funding for this requirement is provided by the Program Management Office for the Attack Scout Helicopter to carry-over technologies from their 2002 Kiowa Warrior PM initiative. This requirement is a direct extension of the Armys prior 2002 PM initiative.  The ICI design, materials, and manufacturing methods were successfully developed, integrated and applied to the OH-58D.  Accordingly, this acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(l), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements without substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Armys requirement.  Market research has identified ICI as the only source with the technology expertise and relevant, demonstrated experience in applying this expertise to the design and manufacturing process of the composite UWP for the OH-58D and is readily available because of tooling acquired at private expense to undertake manufacture of the CUWP upon which qualification can immediately initiate in order to address readiness for contingency operations. The Government deems that substantial duplication of cost incurred under the previously conducted research cannot be recovered through competition.  No other known source has the equivalent technical maturity to satisfy the Government requirement in the timeframe required.  Many of the manufacturing details to be further explored under the planned efforts are proprietary to ICI.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to ICI.  The contract terms and requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and ICI, consistent with alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).   The overall period of performance for the IDIQ contract is sixty (60) months.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 336413 and the size standard is 1,000.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that shall be considered.  Written proposals shall be submitted no later than September 4, 2008 at 12:00pm EST and should be addressed to AATD, Attn: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (Ceseley Dunbar), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Ms. Dunbars phone number is 757-878-2771.  Anyone desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing at the above address, fax 757-878-0008 or Email: ceseley.dunbar@us.army.mil.  Contracting Officer is Lauren Sebring who can be reached at 757-878-4828 or lauren.sebring@us.army.mil.  Notes 22 and 26 apply.

The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has ch allenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requi res a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts  for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Bar racks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT facilities.  The prim ary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identifi ed as Northwest (CO, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) fo r an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Advanced Individual Training (AIT), Basic Training (BT) Barracks and Warrior in Transition (WIT) Barracks, or other similar facilities:  <BR><BR>Advanced Individual Training Co mplexes:<BR>AIT complexes are comprised of multiple facilities, consisting of Barracks/Company Operations Facilities (BCOF), Dining Facilities (DFAC), Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ), Support Facilities, and Outdoor Areas.

It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Pro posals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders. <BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals,  demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solici tation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  <BR><BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule an d a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions  of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the ini tial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR><BR>The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Buildi ng Systems and Materials; and Sustainability Requirements.  Volume II:  Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.  <BR><BR> Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 10 Mar 08 under solicitation number W9126G-08-R-0145.

In the event that one or more of the contracts proposed for award cannot be made, the Government may award contracts with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitat ion.   If only one of the proposed contracts under this MATOC can be made, the Government reserves the right to award a SATOC with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.  The Government reserves the r ight to award only the initial task as a c-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude.

Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsat isfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitati on.   Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.  Once the contracts under this solicitation are awarded and there is duplicative coverage for this facility type in the same region, any requirement less than $15 million will be evaluated first for advertisement under any set-aside contract or pool of contracts prior.  The Government will consider the current workload under the set-aside contract, performance on previous t ask orders, and the small business firms ability to obtain additional boding prior to making a determination.  <BR><BR>The total estimated contract capacity is $253,500,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of  twelve (12) months with up to 2 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 36 months.

<DESC>17.  This is a sole source procurement IAW FAR 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1).  An approved justification and approval is on file in Contracting Division.  The Huntington District intends to negotiate a contract with Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tilton (EMH&T) to complete portions of the Mason Run Watershed (Whitehall) Special Study.  A storm water improvement study for the Mason Run Watershed was completed by EMH&T in June 2006 under the Section 594 Environmental Infrastructure program.  In this study, EMH&T refined the hydraulic and hydrologic models for the entire watershed and also determined the locations within the watershed where the flows were contributing to flooding in the city of Whitehall.  A special study is currently underway within the Mason Run Watershed, located in Franklin County, Ohio.  The study is being used to develop measures to ameliorate the flood hazards among the Mason Run Watershed, which have arisen due to urbanization of the watershed.  During the study, eight flood reduction measures were developed to reduce flooding.  The most promising flood reduction measure is the construction of a retention basin on the northern portion of the Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC).  This contract will request that drawings, specifications, construction sequencing and an environmental assessment be developed for this alternative.  For further information regarding this announcement, contact Richard D. Horton at (304) 399-5623.

ON OR ABOUT SEPTEMBER 23, 2008, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District will issue a Request for Proposal for the construction of Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) consisting of a 144-person barracks facility at Fort Wainwright, Alaska.  The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis using full and open competitive procedures. The procurement will be conducted using source selection procedures and the award will be based on the best value to the Government considering price and non-price factors cited in this announcement and the solicitation.  Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed price.  NAICS Code:  236220 with a current size standard of $31,000,000; however, notice has been placed in the Federal Register which shall increase the small business size standards for this NAICS Code to $33,500,000 effective August 18, 2008.  The Federal Supply Code is Y163. Offerors are advised that a contract resulting from this solicitation is contingent upon funding and Congressional approval.  Should Congress not authorize this project or appropriate the funds, the solicitation will be canceled. If the project is canceled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror.  If a large business is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirements for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The FY08 subcontracting goals for this contract are a minimum of 70.0% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses, 6.2% of that to small disadvantaged businesses, 7.0% to woman-owned small businesses, 9.8% to HUBzone small businesses, and 3.0% to veteran-owned small business, and 0.9% to service disabled veteran-owned small business.  The Davis-Bacon Act will apply.  All responders are advised that this project may be canceled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation and final award.  All contractors are advised that they must be registered in CCR and ORCA (http://orca.bpn.gov).  Joint ventures must also be registered in CCR and ORCA as a joint venture.  We advise contractors to begin this process when they prepare their proposal in order to ensure registration is in place should they be selected for the award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. (Reference DFAR 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration).

Access for individuals with disabilities will be provided in public areas.  Comprehensive building and furnishings interior design services are required.  This acquisition is a 1-Phase solicitation where performance capability and price are evaluated in a single phase.  SELECTION CRITERIA: Award will be based on the Best Value approach.  Offerors will be evaluated based upon the following non-price evaluation factor: Performance Capability to include:  specialized experience; past performance; proposed contract duration and summary schedule; key personnel capabilities and experience; small business utilization; and Price. The Subcontracting Plan required for Large Businesses will be evaluated on a Go/No Go basis. The overall non-price evaluation rating is considered more important than price.  OBTAINING THE SOLICITATION:  The solicitation for this project will be available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY and will be available for download on or about September 23, 2008.  All solicitation documents will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website,    http://www.fbo.gov.

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)Eastern Logistic Service Area1701 Columbia AvenueCollege Park, Georgia 30337
SIR No.  DTFASO-08-R-00026HVAC Construction, Modernization, and Repair Service Projects-Eastern Logistics Service Area

The purpose of this Screening Information Request (SIR) is to evaluate and select multiple firms for issuance of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) for HVAC  services (construction and servicing) relating to FAA facilities located in the Eastern Service Area.  Firms issued a BOA may receive requests for technical and/or price proposals leading to award of call orders for simple to moderate complexity fixed-price construction contracts.  Issuance of Basic Ordering Agreements will be based on evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth below.  Award of specific call orders as requirements arise will be based on price and other factors as deemed desirable by the FAA.  Specific firm fixed price call orders will be competed among the successful firms.  The Government, in its sole discretion, will determine which, and how many, of the firms holding Basic Ordering Agreements will be requested to submit price and technical proposals for requirements leading to firm fixed price call orders.  The range in value of call orders is expected to be $10,000.00 to $1,000,000.00.
The Eastern Service Area includes the New England region (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut), the Eastern region (New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia), and the Southern Region (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and Bahamas).  Offeror firms must specifically identify which specific regions and/or states in which the firm is ready, willing, and able to perform task orders issued under the BOA.  
No contractual obligation is created by issuance of any basic ordering agreement.  Contractual obligations only arise after issuance of call orders under the basic ordering agreement, after consideration of price and technical factors.  The FAA will not be restricted to the firms issued Basic Ordering Agreements as a result of this SIR in order to fulfill its contracting requirements.  Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued call order creates such obligation.
Work may include, but is not limited to, the following:  
Furnishing all labor, materials, equipment, and services as necessary to provide turn-key HVAC Construction, Modernization and Repair Services for the FAA with minimum review and supervision.  The work also involves, but is not limited to, construction, modernization, and repair of HVAC systems in FAA facilities; however, the contractor shall have the capability to modify or construct any incidental systems such as mechanical, electrical, structural, piping, etc., necessary for the proper installation, operation, maintenance, and protection of the systems.  The HVAC systems include very small window-type units as well as large central plant-type cooling/heating systems.  Expertise in the repair, replacement, and modernization of all types of systems is not required, and specialty trades such as piping, controls, electrical, and fuel distribution may be subcontracted.  Work may also involve general demolition, and removal of trash/debris.
These systems are contained in facilities that house and support air traffic control personnel and electronic equipment that comprise the National Airspace System.  These facilities include Airport Traffic Control Towers (ATCT's), Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC's), and other radar, communications, navigational, and office facilities.
In addition to plans, specifications, and/or statements of work for each particular project, call orders issued under these Basic Ordering Agreements shall incorporate all contract clauses specified in the attached, in addition to any other clauses and provisions that may be appropriate to add to specific call orders.  Those contract clauses shall be deemed to be amended to conform to forms of the clauses required by the FAA Acquisition Management System as of the date of execution of individual call orders.
You may contact Kiersten D. Sellers at Kiersten.Sellers@faa.gov or Brenda J. Sullivan at (404) 305-5791 for any additional questions regarding this announcement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the September, 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 97-27. This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541219 with a small business size standard of $6.0 million. 
It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mr. John Mahoney, Brinklow, Maryland, to provide expert management and budgetary services to the NIH Business System (NBS) project. NIH recently completed a comprehensive management and systems analysis to define the requirements for a new administrative computing system and evaluated potential systems to satisfy these requirements. This analysis has determined that the NIH must replace its current system with an off-the-shelf software product. As part of this implementation, NIH has engaged the services of numerous functional specialists to help design and configure the software to suit NIH needs. NIH is seeking the assistance from an individual with a detailed understanding of NIH management, budget along with related administrative systems experience and expertise in these issues. NIH requires the detailed technical services to support the NBS project for a period of two years and six months. Specifically, the contractor shall support the NBS Project Manager in the following areas: 1) Developing and maintaining the balanced scorecard evaluation approach, with specific attention to the project monitoring level, for the NBRSS implementation phase. 2) Developing and implementing a monitoring and review methodology specifically checking the System Integrators adherence to the Project Plan, the proposed budget, and overall schedule. This methodology will incorporate earned value calculations. 3) Maintaining and monitoring tracking chart that follows the schedule of NBS activities to be accomplished prior to the start of activities of the functional work teams. 4) Performing policy and issue analyses for the NBRSS project on a myriad of topics as assigned by the Project Manager. Following these analyses, develops appropriate policy documents/memoranda/reports/presentations for NBRSS review. Mr. Mahoney will also support NIH management and administration in the following areas: 1) Assisting the Chair, Funding Advisory Review Board in administering a process that analyzes competing corporate funding proposals, provides priority funding recommendations to NIH senior management and ensures that out-years costs for proposed projects have been identified  and set forth as part of a 3-year planning process; 2) Coordinating the staff analysis of proposals submitted to the Board to assure that members have sufficient information upon which to make prioritized funding recommendations ; and 3) Providing advice to the Board on overall funding strategies considering the overall resources required to fund the competing proposals, and the likely resources that will be available to NIH for these proposals. Mr. Mahoney has provided expert management services to the Office of the Director, Office of Management for the last three years, under several purchase orders. Mr. Mahoneys previous experience with the NIH uniquely qualifies him as the only source capable of successfully providing the necessary services. This requirement represents a continuation of the services he is currently providing to the NBS project. He therefore will require no orientation to NIH management and related administrative issues. He has an extensive knowledge of NIH management and administrative issues. He has vast management knowledge of the type required by the NBS project. NIH has determined that Mr. Mahoney is the source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience that can successfully complete the requirements listed above. This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all proposals received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NIH. Vendor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) www.amet.gov/far/ .

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), Meteorological Science Division (MSD) located in Kansas City, MO, intends to establish a fixed price purchase order, base year (12 months) for the purpose of creating a database for low flow/stage impacts on the Upper Colorado River Basin on a sole source basis from The National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC), Lincoln, NE based on the following: 1) The emphasis of the contract is to build a database which is grounded on water resources availability. The NDMC has accumulated many years of experience dealing with water resource issues pertaining to drought and the mitigation of drought. There is no other entity in the United States that has this wealth of corporate knowledge; 2) The study requires outreach to National, State, and local entities within the river basin in question. The NDMC has worked in partnership with many Federal and State programs in creating and implementing drought mitigation procedures. They are uniquely aware of who the users of water resources across the country are and have established many close contacts with them. The NDMC retains many connections with those that have knowledge of water resource use and agencies that regulate water. No other entity would have the breadth of contacts across the United States as NDMC does; 3) NDMC is uniquely positioned to build such a low flow/stage database with a wealth of expertise and corporate knowledge housed at the Center. The NDMC has a staff well suited to gathering the technical and socio-economic information needed to create this database. Having dealt with such issues in the past the Center can not only construct the database accurately but ask the appropriate questions of the water resources users. No other group has such a wide variety of specialties from social to science that are required to meet the mission requirements of this contract; 4) As a neutral entity the NDMC is not in a position that will favor any particular sector of the economy or Government entity; 5) NDMC has already completed five similar projects across the United States and delivered results that are exemplary. <br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b). Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses. However, all responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Responses can be faxed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923 or sent via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications; and sufficient information that describes or demonstrates the firms knowledge in creating an implementing drought mitigation procedures. Only affirmative responses to this notice will be evaluated to the extent necessary for the Government to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a competitive acquisition considering demonstrated knowledge of the SEFSC data files and data management system. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the following criteria: 1) Demonstrated experience and qualifications to successfully provide the required services as stated herein.

<DESC>C Site adaptation of an existing design of a Land Port of Entry to the Derby Line I-91 Land Port of Entry (LPOE) Modernization Project.  

Description:
The General Services Administration, (GSA) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Orcutt Associates, Portland, Maine, to adapt an existing design for the new Land Port of Entry at Derby Line, VT.  This notice is not a request for proposals (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation and no solicitation package exists at this time.   

The proposed contract will require the contractor to adapt the design of the Jackman, Maine Land Port of Entry to the Derby Line I-91 site.  The design for Jackman, Maine contains design features which are consistent with the program requirements for the site at Derby Line, Vermont.  The proposed contract will expedite delivery of design and construction due to the similar requirements for the Jackman LPOE and the Derby Line I-91 LPOE.  Site adaptation of this existing design includes features which are either highly desirable or integral to requirements.  These include a small land port of entry structure on the northern border of the United States designed in accordance with and to the security requirements of the GSA P-130, Land Port of Entry Design Guide; the GSA P-100, Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service; LEEDS certification and having been approved by the GSA Office of the Chief Architect.  

The program requirements for the Jackman LPOE and the Derby Line I-91 LPOE are similar to such a degree that the adaptability of the design for the Jackman LPOE to the Derby Line I-91 site satisfies the needs of the client, Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  These include a small land port of entry structure on the northern border of the United States, with a main structure of approximately 23,000 s.f. and being an in the roadway median design.  Orcutt Associates is unique in having developed the design for the Jackman, Maine LPOE.  GSA knows of no other consultants from whom this design, or a similar design, is available.  

The work performed under this contract includes, but is not limited to the following: using the design for the structure completed for the Land Port of Entry at Jackman, Maine and adapting the design of the structures to the site at Derby Line I-91 in Vermont, extra field Investigations, schematic design, design development, construction documents, post construction contract services, management and inspection services, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, fire protection, landscaping and security.  

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is FAR 6.302-1, which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Firms wishing to challenge the sole source acquisition must, within fifteen (15) days of this notice, submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered that demonstrates their firms ability to provide, and experience in providing, a site adaptation of an existing GSA approved design for a modern Land Port of Entry incorporating the features described above.  Designs that have not been approved by the GSA Office of the Chief Architect are not eligible for this requirement.  

Interested parties shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment as to whether the product and capabilities meet technical acceptability. Interested parties shall be able to comply with all requirements described herein to be considered capable.

<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Diapers, Adult (Adult Diapers).<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is September 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Adult Diapers, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $39,784.52.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  This is included as a reporting metric.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  Brief Disposable Extra Large $12,945.93; Attends 10 Classic Large Brief, $8,613.93; Attends Large Insert Pad, $4,046.16; Wing Choice Plus Briefs, $2,629.62; Brief Fitted Adult Large Premium Tactics Odor Control Concentration, $2,404.91; Wings Choice Plus Brief, Medium $2,015.01; Attends Adult Fitted Brief W/P $1,868.09; Brief Fitted Adult Medium Premium tactics, $1,862.55; Brief Fitted Adult Extra Large Tactics $1,476.42.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>INTERESTED RESPONDENTS MUST PROVIDE DETAILED HARD COPY RESPONSES TO THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA REQUIREMENTS STATED WITHIN THIS NOTICE BY 3PM CST ON 13 August 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide hard copy responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for mail to be lost, vendors must confirm with the Regional POC stated below that their submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  Each submitting vendor will confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>Responses should be sent via your preferred delivery carrier with a requested return receipt and/or tracking number to Ms. Sarah Allen, Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230. (ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS TO INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTED)  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Ms. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 or at sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>  Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested respondents are to respond to this FBO announcement by mailing their intent to participate with hard copies of the following information: company name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax, email address, announcement number, DAPA number and complete answers to the technical criteria to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); (6) Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, National FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA.  and (7) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>If industry participation is unsatisfactory, the TPRB will decide whether to proceed with or delay the project.<BR><BR>All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Also, all communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.<BR><BR>The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process.<BR><BR> The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Adult Diapers products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: Disposable Fitted Briefs with and without odor control in sizes youth, small, medium, regular, large and extra-large; Disposable Winged Briefs in sizes small, medium, regular, large and extra-large; Insert Pads in sizes small, medium, regular, large and extra-large; (All briefs should contain fluff with polymer, have a non-woven interior liner, be breathable and have adjustable fit tabs).  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Adult Diapers product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>4.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>5.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.  <BR>6.	Vendors must supply instructions/directions for use for all products to be supplied. Provide this information with the product literature submitted in response to this RFQ.<BR>7.	Vendors must provide in-service staff training and identify company resources for such requirements with the initial submittals.  Provide literature on the training.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team facilitated by the TRBO will request samples (at no charge to the government) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Due to the length of the standardization process CPT members and facilities may be adjusted/changed due to military mission requirements (TDYs Deployments, PCS, etc.) when necessary.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be sent/delivered to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM CST, on the twenty-first calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR>  <BR>CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical evaluation period is estimated to last approximately six calendar days.  The CPT will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to more acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT will determine/approve that both product literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation.   The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT for review.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price.  Based on the clinical evaluation results, the CPT will provide a vendor selection recommendation to the TPRB. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below: <BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR><BR>1.

The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Impact on SKUs by each vendor.  5) The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.    <BR>2.	Vendors that meet the 3.0 clinical acceptability target threshold will be qualified to submit best value pricing for analysis to the TRBO.  Those vendors with results less than 3.0 will be disqualified from further consideration depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Central Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>4.	Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR>5.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<BR>6.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.<BR>7.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB reviews the data to support a selection of the best-value, lowest quote of the clinically preferred products.<BR>8.	The Designated Senior Logistician (DSL) will review the data and recommendation and determine the best-value, lowest quote of the clinically preferred products, selecting the vendor(s) for the Regional Incentive Agreement(s) under this standardization initiative<BR>

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
<p>DISA Central Field Command, 7115 S. Boundary Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL 33621-5101, for non-VOIP Telephone System (PBX) for Building 805, MacDill AFB. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Black Box Network Services 1010 Haley Road, Murfreesboro, TN 37129. Black Box Network Services Black Box Network Services has a local office in St. Petersburg that will perform the install and maintenance required by DISA Central Field Command. Interested parties may e-mail Scott.gebhardt1@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, Attn: SSgt Scott Gebhardt, not later than Monday 28th July, 2007; 9:00 a.m. EST.</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:</p>
<p>22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>DISA requires a local Nortel PBX contractor for support due to the nature of its mission (24/7). A Nortel solution is required to interface with MacDill AFB existing Nortel SL-100 switch. Through local market research, we have contacted local telephone contractors to determine if they could meet our requirement and if the pricing would be feasible. The local contractors we contacted are:</p>
<p>-Coleman Technologies, Inc. (Quote: $93,806 for Cisco equipment)<br />-Network Liquidators (could sell only Nortel refurbished equipment)<br />-MCSoft, Inc. (has not worked with the DoD; does not have the technical expertise)<br />-Teamwork Net (has not worked with the DoD; does not have the technical expertise)</p>
<p>Because of the high risk involved in dealing with contractors that do not totally understand both our PBX requirement that will support DSN and the interface involved with the 6th Comm. Squadron SL-100 switch, we have to exclude the above contractors. Nortel Government Solutions provided Black Box Network Services as a contractor that has a lot of DoD phone system experience. Additionally, the local Black Box vendor has worked on 6th Comm. Squadron's Nortel equipment.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a contract to the University of Arizona, 888 N. Euclid Ave., Tucson, AZ 85721-0001. This notice represents the only official notice of this solicitation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by July 28, 2008 may be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government has made the determination that it would be in the best interest to sole source this effort to the University of Arizona. It is the Government's belief that only University of Arizona can provide the required services for the following reasons:  The University of Arizona possesses the unique qualifications which are required for this acquisition and the University of Arizona established, owns, operates, and maintains Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET) which collects and reports the majority of the meteorological data Reclamation requires. No other vendor has access or permission to access these weather stations, nor does the University of Arizona subcontract this effort.
Reclamation requires daily and annual Standardized Reference Evapotranspiration values from AZMET, as well as the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS), stations located along the Lower Colorado River to support monitoring and accounting of consumptive use of water from the lower Colorado River.
Reclamation must monitor and account for the consumptive use of water from the lower Colorado River.  One of the programs Reclamation has developed is the Lower Colorado River Accounting System (LCRAS). The LCRAS program calculates evapotranspiration values for crops and riparian vegetation, and evaporation from open water surfaces along the lower Colorado River and adjacent areas to which Colorado River water is diverted and consumed.  These evapotranspiration and evaporation values are used to monitor water use and the efficiency of water use, water exchange programs between water users, and to facilitate consumptive use calculations.  
The tasks to be accomplished include:
Task 1: Operate and maintain eight automated weather stations in Arizona located along the lower Colorado River and adjacent areas to which Colorado River water is diverted and used. As part of the operation and maintenance functions, the University shall provide quarterly on-site maintenance, preventative maintenance, emergency maintenance, and data processing on a daily basis. Task 2: Compute daily standardized reference evapotranspiration values from the meteorological data sets obtained from the AZMET and CIMIS stations and prepare the meteorological data sets from all weather stations operated.
Anticipated award date is September 30, 2008.  For questions, please contact Marge Schafer at (702) 293-8394 or email mschafer@lc.usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services, the size standard is $6.5M.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NOAA Satellite and Information Service (NESDIS) has provided both in-kind and financial support to the Conference over the past 20 years, first when it was hosted at West Chester University and more recently, at California State University at Los Angeles (CSU-LA). The College of Education at CSU-LA is known for its skill in hosting conferences that bring together educators from across the United Stated and the world to interact with scientists and engineers. Originally, the Conference focused upon the ways in which educators could use data from polar-orbiting satellite through the use of direct readout stations at schools. With the growth of the Internet, the Conference has expanded to include geostationary satellite data and a wide variety of satellite applications, such as using data to track forest fires and to estimate vegetation stress.<br />This annual meeting brings together coastal managers from states, territories, and commonwealths from across the nation and provides a forum for discussion with their federal counterparts on emerging issues in ocean and coastal resource management.
<p>One of the cross-cutting priorities in the NOAA Strategic Plan is "Promoting Environmental Literacy." This Conference provides an avenue for engaging stakeholders from the educational arena. NESDIS scientists are able to provide information about NESDIS products and services in a "train the trainer: concept, where educators take what they learn back to their schools and teach other teachers. By partnering with the university community, other federal agencies, and private industry, NESDIS is able to multiply its outreach endeavors. Other NOAA Line Offices are participating in sponsorship of this Conference.</p>
<p>The 2008 Satellite and Education Conference is being coordinated by California State University at Los Angeles and it is believed that there&nbsp;is no responsible source that will satisfy the NOAA/NESDIS requirements. California State University will provide NOAA Satellite with an Executive Report of the Conference, conduct and tabulate a customer survey and provide a written report of the results.</p>
<p>The Satellite and Education Conference is sponsored by the Satellite Educators Association (SEA) in partnership with academia, federal agencies, and private industry. The SEA, established in 1988, is professional society to promote the innovative use of satellite technology in education. Membership includes master educators who use satellites and related technologies as a vehicle for helping students appreciate and understand the complex interrelationships among science, technology, individuals, societies, and the environment. In 2006, over 175 teachers from across the country participated in the Conference.</p>
<p><br />No other source is known to possess the same capabilities. Notwithstanding the Government's intent to negotiate on a single source basis under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, any source possessing the capabilities to provide the required service may submit a statement of capabilities which, if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. Responses must be received by July 31, 2008. Responses must be emailed to Joel.L.Perlroth@noaa.gov or faxed to (301)713-4155. Award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures pursuant to FAR Part 13.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Western Shelter Systems Inc. (WSSI) for the re-supply of National Disaster Medical Systems (NDMS) inventories in support of the Disaster Medical Assistance (DMA) mission.  The proposed award is for $1.4M under NAICS 624230.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, WSSI, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by the FAR Part 6.302-1.  WSSI is the only known available source with unique capabilities to satisfy NMMS requirements because the Rapid Deploy Shelter System product it manufactures has become the standardized sheltering system used across NDMS programs.  Due to the nature of the Rapid Deploy Shelter System and the specificity of component parts within that system, it is considered critical that any supplier possess the requisite knowledge and capability to readily supply system-specific accessories for seamless integration into the system and replenishment of existing inventories. 

The purpose of this notice is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to supply the Rapid Deploy Shelter System package accessories.  Any source capable of supplying the accessories should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as articulated above. 

This notice is issued for information purposes and is not a request for competitive proposals. Any interested party should submit a statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirements of this notice can be met no later than 15 days from the date of the announcement.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed action based on responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Reponses to this notice must be sent via e-mail to William.Li@psc.hhs.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Revenue Center, Topeka, KS (VAHRC), located at 3401 SW 21st, Topeka, KS, 66604, intends to award a firm fixed price  contract for the upgrade of its Telephony Banner Board Display system to Inova Solutions of Charlottesville, Virginia IAW FAR 6.302-1 and 41U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  The DVA HRC maintains a state of the art call center that receives in excess of three million phone calls per year. The current architecture is configured with an Inova Solutions display system already installed that was acquired via a delivery order against the then current GSA FSS contract.  All applications and software updates have been written to integrate with the current Inova Solutions platform.  Costs of converting the existing telephony systems to share data with a new display system would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The expansion and or replacement of select components with Inova solutions products are to insure 100% compatibility with the present I.T. infrastructure.This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to meet these requirements.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination to conduct a competitive procurement will be at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. Phone inquiries will not be accepted. Responses related to this notice shall be in writing and must be received no later than July 29, 2008. POC Barry Fetzer, DVA HRC, 3401 SW 21, Bldg 9, Topeka, KS 66604.  The value of this acquisition is above the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.  This is a simplified acquisition.*****

<DESC>This requirement is for two paper cutters at the locations listed below:

The government reserves the right to make multiple awards.

Item # 1.

SPECIFICATION/JUSTIFICATION FOR
ACQUISITION OF
30 HEAVY DUTY INDUSTRIAL PAPER CUTTER
FOR
DAPS HILL AFB, UTAH

INTRODUCTION:  DAPS Bangor has received authorization and funds to replace the large industrial Polar Paper Cutter, Model 92EMC, serial number 5116351, at the DAPS Hill AFB facility. Due to the nature of the current workload, as well as anticipated future workload, the replacement paper cutter should be of a substantial enough structure to perform the required operations.

TRADE-IN CONSIDERATION:  DAPS HQ Business Division has mandated that we seek trade-in value on currently used equipment wherever and whenever possible. This is in accordance with DAPSI 4161.1 (paras. 4.6, 4.7 and 5. DRAFT).  The item to be traded-in is:  Polar Paper Cutter, 37 Size, Model 92EMC, serial number 5116351, purchase price was $32,545, and it is listed as being 17 years old.  We estimate the trade-in value as being between 1% to 3%, or $325-$975 (negotiable). Vendor would have to remove item from DAPS facility, within 30 days of the installation of the new paper cutter, or sooner as negotiated.

SPECIFICATIONS
- Cutting Width must be at least 30 in order to accommodate paper stock and printed engineering drawings (w/aprons) requiring final trim
- Heavy Duty, hydraulic industrial floor model paper cutter, so that varying weights and sized of paper stock can be easily cut to size; constructed of steel and/or cast iron
- Clamp opening must be 4 so that a ream (500 sheets) of our heaviest stock, index can be cut at once to maximize efficiency
- Paper cutter should have programming capability, in order to pre-program cuts to increase efficiency; alpha-numeric keypad, data screen, and 999 preset programming cutting memory would be sufficient. The cutting to size of various technical manuals, as smoothly and quickly as possible is required
- Paper cutter should have a pre-clamp function which allows the operator to clamp paper prior to beginning the cut. As a safety feature, the pre-clamp can be foot operated, and the cutting blade would be a two hand on button operation, so that both hands and feet are away from the blade; pre-clamp should also be adjustable, so that operator can make adjustments depending on stock being cut
- Work surface on paper cutter should be lighted, so that operator can position work appropriately, and improve visibility for safe operations of cutter
-  Backguage should be variable speed, so that operator can better control cutting, and removal of excess cut-away trim
- SAFETY FEATURE: Because of the inherent danger in operating this type of equipment, a standard safety feature, electric eye or beam should be installed on the paper cutter between the operator and the cutting blade, so that if the beam is interrupted while a cut is being made, the blade and clamp will return to the Up position
- For efficiency, paper cutter should have some passive or active form of notification for the operator to indicate when the blade should be changed and the cutter is in need of lubrication; this is for higher efficiency, waste avoidance and protection of the equipment (avoid overheating) 
- Since we have pre-existing equipment and electrical power, new paper cutter should be 3-phase, 60 Hz, 208/220 Volt, 25 Amp, UL Listed, with a 5 HP motor
- Paper cutter should come with at least one blade, cutting sticks, and an operators manual 
- Set up and operator training is also required

<DESC>The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act:  A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) stipulates that the Secretary of Transportation must make a number of determinations before a grant or loan can be made for the construction of any project seeking Section 5309 New Starts funds.  These determinations require that the planning process generate credible information on project costs, ridership, financing, and environmental impacts.  United States Code, 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 Section 5309 (Section 5309 New Starts) contains criteria for determining whether New Start projects are eligible for funding. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Office of Planning and Environment (TPE) is responsible for assessing New Starts projects to verify that requirements for eligibility for New Starts funding have been met.  

TPE assesses individual projects to insure that: a) the project meets the New Starts project justification criteria; b) the project is supported by an acceptable degree of local financial commitment, including evidence of stable and dependable funding sources to construct, maintain, and operate the current system and proposed new service; and, c) that any proposed project considered for Section 5309 New Starts funds has meet all requirements for National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) processes and environmental documentation and that impacts are properly assessed, documented, and mitigated.  FTA uses this information to recommend Section 5309 New Starts funds for the projects with the greatest merit.

 have not, within a&#61551; Have, &#61551;(2)  three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

The PRISM product has just finished the gold master of the game with both single-player and multiplayer levels.  <BR><BR>Specifics Objectives:  The multiplayer level portion of the game requires player matching and bandwidth services in order to function.  Over the past year the number of individuals playing the multiplayer version of the game has steadily increased.  With the release of new levels for both single-player and multiplayer, the government requires player matching, bandwidth and network associated services.  The contractor shall also recommend a plan for follow-on gaming levels/environments which could be used.<BR><BR>The host webpage on both the www.prismthegame.com and the www.1800GoGuard.com URLs remains the same.<BR><BR>The contractor should use previous historical information in planning their response to the RFP.<BR><BR>The contractor shall develop a plan for marketing, NTE $10K, which maximizes game play and encourages referrals.  The contractor should ensure that the recommendation is all-inclusive.  For example if the plan is for direct shipment of items to registering game players, then the contractor should include all costs in their proposal.<BR><BR>It is expected that various ODCs (shipping, hardware/software, LAN, etc.) will be required in support of this contract.  Based upon previous estimates this should not exceed $10K.  All ODCs should directly relate to the PRISM game support package.<BR><BR>Period of Performance:  The contractor will propose based upon a one-year period of performance.  <BR><BR><BR>

Commercial Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Technology Applications Program 

BAA #: 	DTOS59-08-RA-00002 
White Papers Due: 		4:15 PM, EDT, September 12, 2008 
Agreement Officer:	James H. Mowery III, 202-366-4959, james.mowery@dot.gov.		
 
CONTACT INFORMATION:  Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), being issued on behalf of the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is soliciting information and descriptions (White Papers) for activities to validate initiatives in support of the U.S. DOT Commercial Remote Sensing and Spatial Information (CRS&SI) technology application program for transportation infrastructure development and construction.  At the level of the PRIME offeror (Applicant), competition is restricted to universities.  Proposed SUB-Recipients may, however, be any kind of organization or individual, commercial or otherwise. Interested and eligible offerors may submit separate White Papers on one or more of the initiatives described in this announcement.  Each White Paper on each initiative must not exceed fifteen (15) pages and must include the offerors contact information:  point of contact, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address.  Separate White Papers must be submitted for each proposed project/initiative and multiple projects/initiatives cannot be combined into a single White Paper.  

SCOPE:  A four-year CRS&SI technology application program is authorized in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), Section 5506. The Act authorized $7.75 million annually for funding during Fiscal Years 2006 - 2009.  The U.S. DOT Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) manages the program.  Because RITA will probably be making multiple Cooperative Agreement awards from this BAA, it is unlikely that any one awardee (i.e., Recipient of a resulting Cooperative Agreement) would receive, in Federal funds, more than a fraction of the $7.5 million that is available under this Phase II of the program.

The program execution was classified into two two-year phases.  Seven projects were awarded in Phase One, resulting in a total obligated funding of $9.0 million. They focused on three commercial remote sensing initiatives in the areas of road construction and conditions, freight congestion mitigation, and development planning and impact.  Phase One began in 2007 and will end in 2009. This is the second two-year phase (i.e., Phase Two) of the program, and Phase Two is scheduled to begin in 2008 and will end in 2010.

The SAFETEA-LU program will focus on major national initiatives and validate CRS&SI technology applications and deliver smarter and more efficient methods, processes and services for transportation infrastructure development and construction. The Phase Two program awards will be competitively selected from consortia teams of university research centers working in partnership with industry and state agencies, and meeting the technical and cost sharing requirements of this announcement. 

These initiatives are chosen based on DOT priorities for CRS&SI technology applications for user services that have the potential to produce a high return on investment, in terms of saving cost and improving the efficiency of infrastructure development and construction. Commercial remote sensing products include remote sensing products from satellites and above ground platforms and from unmanned vehicles. Spatial information technology products include products from Geospatial Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and related Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and services. The proposals should focus on CRS&SI technology products applicable to transportation infrastructure development and construction.  A detailed description of each Initiative is as follows:  

Initiative 1: Infrastructure Development Planning: 

The infrastructure development, planning and decision making process is burdened with challenges of collecting data, adopting innovative methods and timely implementation of new technologies for efficient movement of people and freight. The validation under this initiative must have the following two complementing objectives:

1)	Validate the application of CRS&SI technologies to collect data and provide a framework for analysis in studies and projects related to infrastructure development planning; and

2)	Apply advances in space-based technology application to increase efficiency, reduce congestion and shorten the time required to develop multimodal transportation options.

The purpose of the initiative is to apply CRS&SI technologies to infrastructure development processes to reduce congestion and improve safety within the infra-structure elements such as ports, urban corridors and gateways.  

The results should lead to application of space-based technologies to improve existing planning procedures and/or to develop new procedures to aid and enhance current practices in infrastructure development planning. 

Initiative 2: Transportation Infrastructure Construction and Condition 
Assessment: 

This initiative focuses on validating new methods, tools and systems for cost effectively monitoring the quality of construction and condition of the physical infrastructure. The project deliverables should result in significant cost savings for construction and maintenance of transportation infrastructure. The validation under this initiative must have the following two complementing objectives: 

1)	Validate new applications of CRS&SI technologies for monitoring the quality of infrastructure construction; and

2)	Apply CRS&SI technology integration and products to monitor the condition of constructed infrastructure systems.

The purpose of the initiative is to implement CRS&SI technologies and products for achieving smarter, automated and non-intrusive methods for quality control of infrastructure construction and also develop capabilities for asset management and condition assessment for maintaining the performance and continued serviceability, after construction. The results should lead to longer performing physical infrastructure and significant savings of construction, repair and rehabilitation cost for transportation agencies. The application tools should also contribute to reducing the cost for inventorying and inspecting physical infrastructure systems for asset management.

WHITE PAPERS:  RITA is soliciting White Papers that address one or more of the initiatives outlined in this announcement (see above).  A proposal must include a cost sharing contribution of at least half (50%), in accordance with SAFETEA-LU Section 5101 (a)(1) and (b), of the proposed projects cost to be considered.  In other words, the grand total dollar amount of an Applicants proposed cost-sharing contribution to the project must be equal to the total dollar amount of the Federal funding sought by the Applicant.   Each White Paper must not exceed a total of 15 pages, including any appendices and backup materials and must include sufficient information to determine the probability of achieving the objectives of the initiative and to evaluate the following areas (All evaluation factors are of equal importance):    
1)	Technical concept addressing the initiative;
2)	Technical approach and plans for validating the concept for transportation application;
3)	Background of the performing consortia team in related areas of technologies and space based technology application; 
4)	Proposed partnerships between cooperating consortia of university centers, industry and state agencies; and
5)	Proposed cost and cost sharing contributions to perform the initiative. 


EVALUATION AND SELECTION FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION:  A total of $7.5 million is available for the program and it may increase with the additional funding (subject to availability of funds).   Based on evaluation of the responses received, the U.S. DOT may select one or more initiatives for awards and may choose to fund selected initiatives through Cooperative Agreements.  As stated above, half (50%) cost sharing is required from proposing consortia teams to perform the initiative.  Cost sharing may include direct, indirect and in-kind cost contributions and can be made collectively from the consortia of university research centers, industry and state agencies.  Proposed partnerships and cost sharing arrangements need not be finalized in the White Papers submitted in response to this announcement; but proposed partnerships and cost-sharing arrangements will need to be finalized and presented in detail in any full proposals that RITA may hereafter request from the authors of the best White Papers submitted.  The period of performance for completing each initiative and delivering results must not exceed 24 months.  A panel of federal agency experts will review all White Papers received for responsiveness to the Initiative areas specified above.   Each offeror submitting a White Paper deemed worthy of further consideration and meeting the criteria of this BAA will be notified with possible suggestions for change in scope and detailed guidelines for submitting a full proposal.  The Contracting Officer (Agreement Officer) must give his approval regarding any discussion held between an offeror and the Governments technical staff after submission of a White Paper.


GENERAL INFORMATION:  In all correspondence, please reference the BAA No. DTOS59-08-RA-00002.  Twelve hard copies and one electronic copy of each White Paper shall be submitted.  Hard copies shall be submitted via overnight delivery system to:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractors Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 5 AUG 2008, 5:00 P.M.

In order for the Air Station to fulfill this mission, it is necessary to conduct helicopter hoists of equipment to/from underway vessels, helicopter delivery/recovery of rescue swimmers to/from the water, and fixed wing aerial delivery of dewatering pumps and other equipment to the water.  These skill sets require both initial and proficiency training for Coast Guard pilots and aircrews. This training requires small boat support.  The U.S. Coast Guards increased OPTEMPO and Homeland Security mission has reduced the availability of Coast Guard small boats and crews to provide support for required aviation training.

Additional training periods may be conducted more than once a week to accommodate surge training requirements on a schedule mutually agreed upon by the parties.

1.4.2  Area of Operations:  The area of operations will be the shoreline out to 15 nautical miles from one of the following inlets: Port Everglades, Bakers Haulover or Government Cut.  The specific inlet will be determined by the contractor at the commencement of the contract and may be changed by the contractor with two weeks prior notification to the COTR.

1.4.3  Operational Log:   The contractor shall maintain a log of all operations, which includes dates, location, times, duration and type of evolutions being performed.  The log shall be passed to Air Station Miami COTR on a monthly basis within 5 days of the end of the month.

1.4.6  Functions / Tasks:  The contractor shall support training operations for the hoisting and/or deployment of equipment from government aircraft.  These objects may be delivered directly to the contract vessel or dropped into the water for retrieval.  The contractor shall also serve as an on scene search and rescue asset during helicopter rescue swimmer deployment evolutions and helicopter approaches to the water.  The training to be conducted will be both initial for new aviators/aircrews and proficiency maintenance for experienced aviators/aircrews.

1.5  Performance Evaluation Meetings:  The contractors project manager shall meet at least biweekly with the Contracting Officer, COTR or QAE during the first two months of the contract to discuss performance problems and review contractor corrective actions.  The operational log will also be used to verify the contractors timely arrival on station.  If the contractor fails to meet the scheduled training events or is unable to complete the training activity, the frequency of not fulfilling the scheduled requirements may be the basis for a deduction in the charter hire.   Meetings will be held thereafter at intervals to be established by the COTR or QAE. 

1.6  Communication Procedures:  The government shall provide/assign VHF communication frequencies for contractor use.  The contractor shall provide a cell phone on board for secondary communications with the Air Station Miami Operations Center.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

Questions for Solicitation RFQ-CO2008510018

Question:1

I have been unable to retrieve the evaluation criteria and related information on the Brazil Oil and Gas DM.

 

Answer:

Information referring to the evaluation criteria is located in the Synopsis/Solicitation  Under the Evaluation factors for award FAR.212-2 also see the amended Scope of Work (SOW) for the Terms of Reference (TOR) attachment in FBO.gov 

 

Question:2

I understand that the ALESAT Headquarters are located in Belo Horizonte and the ANP site is in Rio de Janeiro. Does that mean that the trip will involve three sites, including Brasilia, where the Embassy is located? Or will the Rio de Janeiro Consulate stand in for the Embassy?

 

Answer:

The principal cities to be visited are Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte. They would need to meet with the potential Grantees in Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte.  Both cities have U.S. Commercial Service representation, so it is not necessary to travel to Brasilia.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is seeking a contractor to administer a vision testing program for both applicants as well as a small amount of current employees for specific analytic occupations.    
   
The objectives, goals and requirements for this effort are detailed in the attached Statement of Work entitled Vision Testing dated 31 January 2008.  

The contractor must be able to perform the requirement as outlined in the Statement of Work.    The targeted NAICS code for this effort is 621320.  The goal of this requirement is to ensure that applicants meet the vision requirements for specific analytic occupations.   While there is no set vision testing program for current employees, there will be a maintenance program established which would be administered on a case by case basis subject to performance.  NGA requires applicant/employee vision testing services for the populations identified above, to include a variety of different geographic Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) sites.
