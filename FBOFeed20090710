Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  All proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer, 1LT Mike Murphy (316-759-4525) for resolution.

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC><p>Under the contemplated action, the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) will contract with Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) to maintain essential engineering and research capabilities pertaining to ASIP planning and analysis for the T-38 fuselage, wing, empennage, and landing gear, evaluating the usage spectrum, and assessing/determining alternative approaches for stress sequence development. In addition, SwRI will perform risk analysis of static, fatigue, or durability critical aircraft structures, structural health monitoring, non-destructive inspection, general training and any other related activities necessary to support the United States Air Force and the USAFA Center for Aircraft Structural Life Extension (CAStLE).</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is: 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii). FAR 6.302-3 is entitled, "Industrial Mobilization; Engineering, Developmental, or Research Capability; or Expert Services".</p>
<p>In March 1961, the T-38 "Talon" was first delivered to the USAF with the expectation that the weapon system would have a nominal 20-year structural service life. Over the past five decades, both materiel (vis-&agrave;-vis modification programs) and engineering solutions have been employed to ensure structural airworthiness beyond the original 20-year expected service life. Some of the T-38 fighter jet aircraft trainers are nearing an unprecedented 50 years of service. The safety and success of the Warfighter are dependent upon the success of the T-38 System Program Office (SPO)/Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) in sustaining the T-38 fleet to 2020 (and beyond). The Air Force must maintain continuous, focused, and integrated engineering capabilities, to ensure availability of personnel possessing characteristics and skills necessary to meet the fleet safety and structural sustainment needs of the aircraft community. Recent Class-A mishaps at Columbus (2008) and Edwards (2009) Air Force Base(s) (AFBs) resulting in the loss of life, demonstrate an ongoing, unforgiving environment that mandates an immediate response to the situation to ensure continuity in proactive sustainment activities.</p>
<p>These incidences have reinforced the need for a community of well versed, technically competent, rapidly responding personnel. This community must be capable of providing timely, integrated, engineering answers to difficult technical challenges. In order to address this need, risks surrounding three key elements must be categorically mitigated: 1) safety, 2) mission impact, and 3) amount of Government oversight and contractor training prior to performing technical requirements. The operational environment will not accommodate an expenditure of additional resources (both in terms of personnel and cost) to support the time frame necessary for the development of an alternative engineering source for this effort.</p>
<p>To address this environment and the resulting needs, it is essential for the Air Force to maintain SwRI's capabilities; thereby providing immediate, viable, engineering, research, and fleet management expertise to the Program and Warfighter. SwRI has been a major team leader in maintaining the viability of the T-38 weapon system to retirement. SwRI is a non-profit institution. It is positioned to provide unbiased technical assessments to the technical community, by pulling from the Company's wealth of T-38 experience and academic integrity as a research institution.</p>
<p>SwRI has been a primary provider of technical expertise for mechanical testing, flight loads data recording, spectra analyses, durability and damage tolerance analyses, and engineering studies in direct support of the T-38 weapon system for over three decades. Much of this core ASIP data is unique to SwRI. Any other engineering services provider would find it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to be able to manipulate, interpret, and then transform this data into actionable technical information for use by the T-38 SPO/ASIP in a timely manner. For example, SwRI's T-38 Cracks Database, economic life analyses, and data reduction software - custom engineering algorithms and tools developed for the T-38 SPO/ASIP - takes an estimated six months to understand and a year to become proficient in their use. Due to the severity of the environment, this type of delay in execution of requirements would present an unacceptable level of risk to the Warfighter. SwRI has the immediate ability to execute requirements using company unique engineering analyses and tools. <br />SwRI's technical prowess and detailed, comprehensive understanding of the T-38 structure/allied systems is unmatched by any similar aerospace engineering firm. The Institute's capacity as the lead ASIP contractor support organization for the T-38 has consistently provided highly skilled technical performance, responsiveness, and overwhelmingly positive value to the Warfighter.</p>
<p>Historically, SwRI has provided for these essential technical capabilities by maintaining highly skilled company engineers that have ensured continuous, focused, and time critical engineering to the T-38 SPO/ASIP as detailed/demonstrated below:<br />&bull;USAF Fleet Viability Support (2009) - As an outcome of recent aircraft mishaps, and with continued general level concern about the ability of the T-38 weapon system to reach retirement in 2020, the T-38 ASIP/SPO is working with the USAF's Fleet Viability Board (FVB) to provide meaningful strategic direction to the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF). SwRI, as the core provider of technical analyses and studies for the T-38 ASIP/SPO, is the recognized source of technical expertise for the T-38 structure (as most of the reports provided to the FVB's team are SwRI authored documents). In addition, SwRI stands behind their analyses and recommendations, providing a team of technical experts to address the FVB's questions regarding the structural history of the T-38 airframe. SwRI (teamed with the T-38 ASIP/SPO) continues to provide the key documentation and credible responses to the SECAF, the ultimate customer for the FVB's report. Maintaining this level of responsibility and continuity is critical to the success of the FVB in obtaining the buy-in of the SECAF.<br />&bull;Air Force Material Command's (AFMC's) Annual ASIP Review (2004-2009) - In support of the USAF's ASIP, AF leadership provides a technical team of senior structural, material, and aerospace engineers to review and provide recommendations for the various ASIPs. Over the past five review cycles (2007 was skipped), SwRI provided direct technical support to the T-38 ASIP/SPO in addressing engineering leadership's concerns and/or constructive critiques. Much of the review's dialogue centered around analytical and program management studies that SwRI was directly involved in developing; as the key provider of ASIP-related studies for the T-38, SwRI was adept at responding to (and patient with educating) the ASIP Review Team's members. As an outcome of this valued support, the ASIP Review Team has recognized the T-38 SPO/ASIP for a "best practice" in terms of ASIP planning. <br />&bull;T-38 Aileron Actuator Lever Fatigue Analysis (2008) - This engineering study was in direct support of a Class-A mishap that occurred at Columbus AFB. The Columbus mishap resulted in the tragic loss of two USAF pilots and the impact was further compounded by a second fatal mishap only weeks later. As a result of the initial mishap, USAF leadership grounded the entire T-38 fleet. Subsequent mishap investigations uncovered the cause of the Columbus AFB accident to be directly related to metal fatigue of an aileron actuator lever. SwRI was contracted to provide test, analysis, and technical/programmatic support recommendations to the USAF, as the T-38 SPO/ASIP was not positioned to immediately respond to the technical challenge of evaluating the fleet-wide risk. SwRI met all aggressive, short-suspense deadlines for reporting up to the Commander, AFMC (AFMC/CC) and Commander, Air Education and Training Command (AETC/CC) level of senior leadership. SwRI provided detailed, technically sound, and credible support to the associated Independent Review Team (IRT), established by the Commander, Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC/CC) level of leadership, in direct support of the needs of the USAF at large. The final outcome of this effort was stellar technical reporting and lever inspection/replacement recommendations that were on time, within budget, and critical to AETC and the T-38 SPO towards providing guidance on a fleet-wide grounding decision. <br />&bull;T-38 Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI) and Risk Plan (2007-2009) - As the USAF leadership's attention continues to be drawn to the T-38 weapon system, the T-38 SPO/ASIP are routinely required to provide timely, credible, and technically sound risk evaluations for safety and strategic management activities. SwRI is the recognized leader in developing sound risk assessments for use in managing the T-38 fleet. As the architect and sole provider of the only comprehensive ASIP risk plan for the T-38 weapon system, SwRI has provided strategic guidance towards the T-38 ASIP's ability to manage safety of flight risk while mitigating the associated adverse affects to mission impact. Cultivating this unique skill-set over the past three decades, SwRI has demonstrated its ability to readily address short, moderate, and long-term risk assessments with little-to-no guidance from the T-38 SPO/ASIP. The operational environment could not accommodate an expenditure of additional resources (both in terms of personnel and cost) to support an estimated two-year time frame for the development of an alternative engineering source for the described risk evaluations. The most recent risk assessment in SwRI's 2009 reporting is directly related to the life-limiting fuselage structural component (i.e., the dorsal longeron); this timely assessment is currently being used by the T-38 SPO/ASIP for development of the Pacer Classic III modification program - a $200M structural refitting program. In addition to fleet planning activities, such as Pacer Classic III, SwRI is positioned to quickly respond (within weeks) to any structural risk evaluation using the approved USAF Probability of Fracture (PROF) methodologies. This unique capability to support T-38 activities, in terms of both short- and long-term risk assessments, is essential to the management of the T-38 fleet to 2020 (and beyond).<br />&bull;T-38 Airframe Life Study (2002-2007) - This program has been the marquee engineering activity for the T-38 ASIP over the last ten years and it is vital to AETC and the T-38 SPO. SwRI has provided turn-key technical and programmatic support. Under one effort, the Company successfully reconfigured a T-38A aircraft (retired in 1995) by structurally refitting the hull into a near-T-38C configuration. Testing was conducted at SwRI's facilities, with simulated flight loading close-loop controlled by the use of a custom LabVIEW program and over 200 strain gage channels. SwRI provided turn-key engineering with the following technical activities: setting-up the test article, developing the loading sequence, establishing a data collection program, ensuring an appropriate inspection protocol, carefully employing a teardown evaluation, and articulating the final economic life reporting and recommendations. During mid-course of the program, cracking was discovered by SwRI, while looking in locations outside of the test requirements. These findings ultimately leading to a safety inspection Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO). Later in the program, SwRI partnered with the T-38 SPO/ASIP/AETC and original equipment manufacturer (OEM - i.e., Northrop Grumman), developing a comprehensive assessment of the T-38 fleet's structural health. The test program culminated in a briefing to AETC on 30 May 2007, where the nucleus of the Pacer Classic III program (a structural refitting program for 125 aircraft) was formed. The final outcome of this effort was highly credible technical reporting and fleet management recommendations that were on time, within budget, and timely to AETC and the T-38 SPO towards determining the next-generation jet pilot trainer decision. <br />&bull;T-38 Wing Economic Life Evaluations (1993-2009) - In the early- and mid-1990s, the T-38 fleet experienced a number of relatively early wing condemnations, due in large part to fatigue cracking. Working with the Air Force, SwRI performed a full-scale wing test and subsequent teardown inspections of the test article (complemented by additional teardown work of field condemned wings), fully establishing a working baseline for estimating the number of wings required to fleet retirement. In essence, SwRI's unique algorithm for the T-38 usage evaluation and expertise in the wing life process evaluation enabled SwRI to provide the required level of detail to ensure fleet safety - while at the same time maintaining mission capability by recommending the appropriate level of wings for supply. The outcome of this comprehensive study was the establishment of an economic life for the T-38's wing, providing guidance to the USAF in the acquisition of replacement wings for the fleet. In total, over $200M in wings for the T-38 weapon system will be replaced based on SwRI's predictive model. This technical assessment was also instrumental in providing preliminary information used in the redesign of the next-generation of T-38 wings.</p>
<p>The expertise of SwRI described herein will continue to enable the Air Force to immediately address the challenges facing the T-38 SPO/ASIP at present and those projected to occur as the Program sustains the T-38 in the decades to come. In these capacities, the Institute will play a key role in ensuring synergistic benefits and value to the USAF and to the parties that support and rely on the T-38 weapon system.</p>
<p>Any vendor interested in discussing or responding to the effort described in this posting is strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer.</p>

Human Resources strive to maintain a single point of accountability, with common network and systems management tools compatible with current equipment. The existing IT infrastructure has been developed utilizing an architecture based on a Dell sourced platform. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure. Utilizing Dell for these additional enterprise products and services will provide continuity and single point of contact responsibility for the overall infrastructure.  Having Dell as the single vendor for the entire enterprise mix of servers and storage products, including software, provides a clear escalation path and resolution of all issues to maintain critical systems.This action is taken in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as identified by FAR 6.302-1.	Dell provides common images and components with its servers platforms  helping to simplify management and cut costs. Dell has spent the last decade building commonality into the server family with the specific goal of simplifying management and maintenance, while reducing cost and complexity. 	ImageWatch  Dell provides a road map of upcoming software changes, allowing HR to better plan updates. 	Block updates  By delivering scheduled changes, Dell can help minimize the number of updates HR makes each year. 	Image commonality  By reducing the number of overall images in the Dell PowerEdge server line, Dell has reduced the time required for image maintenance. 	Component commonality  The Dell PowerEdge Server Family share common components (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), which help improve efficiency during build and servicing. 	Management commonality  Dell PowerEdge Servers are managed through a common interface to help maximize efficiency and streamline management. Dell OpenManage is provided with ALL Dell systems at no extra cost. OpenManage provides one management interface for hardware, software, and operating systems.<BR><BR>	Dell tracks configurations of every product down to the component level, which allows Dell to quickly and easily analyze product performance and take corrective action when needed. 	Dell provides investment protection when migrating to future Blade Server architectures (ie, going from PowerEdge 1855 to PowerEdge 1955). 	Dell advocates use of industry-standard resource management software where competitors are proprietary (customer lock-in) and expensive. 	Human Resources strive to maintain a single point of accountability, with common network and systems management tools compatible with current equipment. The existing IT infrastructure has been developed utilizing an architecture based on a Dell sourced platform. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure. Utilizing Dell for these additional enterprise products and services will provide continuity and single point of contact responsibility for the overall infrastructure. 	Having Dell as the single vendor for the entire enterprise mix of servers and storage products, including software, provides a clear escalation path and resolution of all issues to maintain critical systems. 	Dell Systems Management provides a single tool to manage and monitor the entire enterprise of servers and storage products.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>The resulting contract from the solicitation will be a frim fixed priced contract with a 12-month base and four 12-month options. The RFP will be issued under the Randolph-Shepard Act and the State Licensing Authority of Alabama.</p>
<p>The intention of this requirement is to obtain contracted Dining Facility and Food Service Management to support DHS/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)/Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) and its facilities located in Anniston, Alabama. These services will require supervision on a 24-hour, 7 day-a-week basis. The Contractor shall provide all support services as identified in the performance work statement (PWS).</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to obtain reliable, efficient and effective services by applying a sound management and technical approach that will provide the best value and meet the objectives shown in this work statement.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS

First Responder Forward Operating Site Services

Description

The Government requires First Responder Forward Operating Site Services.  The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agencys primary mission is to reduce the loss of life and property and protect the Nation from all hazards, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other manmade disasters, by leading and supporting the Nation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation.

This requirement will be a full and open competition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 561210  Facilities Support Services.  To be eligible for award, offerors must be registered with the Central contractor Registry at www.ccr.gov.  Additionally, Representations and Certifications must be completed at http://orca.bpn.gov.   

This requirement is to provide forward site support services for first responder personnel in the Federal Emergency Management Agency, during disaster operations such as hurricanes and earthquakes.  While this forward site support concept applies primarily to disaster situations in the continental US when there is preparation time (e.g. hurricanes), it can also be adapted to no-notice incidents (earthquakes, terrorism), or locations outside the continental United States.  

Requirements are for the following support services:

	Mobile food service (meal preparation)
	Mobile toilets (porta-potties)
	Mobile shower facility
	Mobile laundry facility
	Potable water tanker for decontamination of first responders

During an actual incident all, some, or none of the services listed above may be required, depending on the state of the infrastructure, availability of facilities, extent of damage etc.   Based on requirements multiple awards to contractors may be made to provide first responders needed services.
 
The largest contingent of customers serviced under this contract will be first responders performing the search and rescue operations during the initial phases of disaster response.  In addition forward site occupants may include incident management leadership teams, emergency management personnel, and other first responders.

The disaster environment under which these services are to be provided is very austere, and it is assumed that the stricken area will have little or no operating infrastructure.  Accordingly, contactors are required to be totally self-sufficient in terms of providing specialized transport/storage capacity for their primary mission (e.g. field kitchens, showers), potable water storage, black/grey water storage/removal/disposal/dump fees, electric power, fuel for needed operations (e.g. vehicles and generators), sleeping quarters for contractor personnel, and solid waste disposal.

The services to be provided are different from those normally associated with base camps established by FEMA during the Recovery phase.   The forward operating sites envisioned by this Statement of Work are typically located at or near harms way (hot zones), close to areas most stricken by the incident.   The sites are activated early  hours, not days after the incident occurs.  Once activated, the forward sites are generally short term (usually ten days or less) since the lifesaving mission of search and rescue is short and time-sensitive.   In addition the number of personnel receiving services is generally smaller than those of a long term Recovery base camp.   Forward operating sites involve mobile, flexible, scalable functions.   Contractors should be able to set up and tear down operations in less than six hours.  Several services normally required under a site operation such as lodging and medical support are not required at forward sites.  In addition the Government will provide site security services.   

The contractor is expected to provide all necessary labor, supervision, equipment, tools, materials, and supplies necessary to provide the items and services described herein.  These emergency services shall include (but are not limited to) complete management, control, purchase, receipt, storage, issue, handling, processing, clean up, transport, repair, and maintenance. The Contractor shall have sufficient staffing capabilities and trained specialists to professionally set-up, operate and manage site operations. The Contractor is expected to be able to expand or reduce assets (equipment) rapidly based on changing mission needs and site population.  The Contractor shall have sufficient equipment readily available for rapid deployment, and preventive maintenance programs to ensure optimum readiness levels at all times.

The government intends to award multiple Time & Material (T&M)/Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Hybrid type Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA).  In addition, in awarding this contract, the government will use the procedures established in FAR Part 12 and 15.  It is anticipated that the period of performance will be for one base year plus four one-year option periods.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  

Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for the release of the solicitation and any amendments that may follow.  The final RFP should be available for downloading on or about fifteen (15) days after publication of this announcement.  Requests for hard copy of the solicitation may be made via email at lilian.hutchinson@dhs.gov.  Offerors are cautioned to include the Solicitation Number HSFEHQ-09-R-0080 on all documentation submitted in response to this requirement.  Written technical proposals and business proposals will be required approximately 30 days following the RFP issue date.

Contract award will be based on best-value tradeoff analysis that will result in best value to the Government where technical merit is significantly more important than price.  The estimated award is 15 September 2009 subject to FAR 52.232-19 Availability of Funds.  The Interested Vendors List (IVL) feature has been activated on the Vendors portal to FedBizOpps, and firms are encouraged to provide their contact information in the portal to help maximize teaming arrangements.

<DESC><b>General Information<br></b>
Document Type: Synopsis/ SF 330 request
Solicitation Number: AG-046W-S-09-0022
Posted Date:	 04/15/2009
Response Date: 05/14/2009
Set Aside: none - Full and Open Competition

<b>Description<br></b>
There is no solicitation to download.  The Mt. Hood National Forest  NOCA is seeking a qualified firm to provide professional Architectural and Engineering services for the preparation of the construction documents for the replacement of the main plumbing lines of potable water within Timberline Lodge.  Selection will be in accordance with the Brooks Act and FAR Part 36 to determine the most highly qualified firm.  The Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program applies (FAR Subpart 19.10). This procurement will be unrestricted and therefore is open to all businesses regardless of size. The primary NAICS is 541330, which has a size standard of $4.5 million in average annual receipts.

<b>C.1  Scope of Work<br></b> 
(A) This Statement of Work defines the detailed requirements for the preparation of the construction documents (drawings, specifications, schedule of items, construction estimate and subsequent engineering design calculations) for the replacement of the main plumbing lines of potable water plumbing (hot and cold) within Timberline Lodge, Mt. Hood National Forest, Oregon.  

(B) The design requires strict adherence to the Standards for Rehabilitation and the Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (U.S. Department of Interior).  Preservation of the historic building will be the Contractors main requirement when designing the construction.

(C) The Contractor will have certain creative leniency during the design, barring the design is in agreement with all regulations and this statement of work.  The design will be in compliance with all pertinent governing codes, energy efficient, and at least cost to the government.
(D) State Compliance Requirements:
1.	U.S. Forest Service management policies require that all designs comply with state and local building codes, national standards, and federal design requirements, including all required permit processes.  The Contractor is responsible for identifying all permits that will be required.  
2.	The Contractor shall prepare a plan set for submission to the local/state authorities for review and approval.  The Contractor shall make all necessary changes required by the state from this review at no additional expense to the government.  All changes shall be incorporated into the Final construction documents. The state defines plan submittal requirements at the following website:  http://oregon.gov/DHS/ph/dwp/planreview.shtml
3.	The Contractor will prepare the permit applications and make submissions to the agencies, except where it is agreed upon by the Government, Contractor, and state officials.  The Contractor will pay all fees directly to the agency.

<b>C.2  Project Background<br></b>
(A) Timberline Lodge is a National Historic Landmark located on Mt. Hood, Oregon.  It has served as a ski lodge and mountain retreat since 1937 and today sees approximately 2 million visitors each year.  The Lodge is located at timberline (6,000 feet) and therefore experiences extreme weather variations.  The current copper water pipes were installed in 1992 and have been failing at an increasing rate over the last 3 years.  The cause of failure was determined to be mostly Type 1 Cold Water Pitting with fewer cases of installation-caused failures and galvanic corrosion failures also existing.  The study recommended the use of heavier walled copper (type K or L), cross-linked polyethylene (PEX), or some combination when replacing the lines.

(B) There are no plans for major future development of the site at this time.  

(C) The plumbing to be replaced is located within the walls and floors, the two attics, the steam line corridors, and various other access tunnels.  Many of the lines cannot be seen in their entirety.  

<b>C.3  Project Location<br></b>
The project site is located on Mt. Hood approximately 3 miles north of Government Camp, Oregon, off State Highway 26.  

<b>C.4  Available Construction Funding and Project Schedule<br></b>
(A) The funding available for constructing this project is unknown.  The Construction Design and Estimate will enable the Forest Service to budget for the project in upcoming fiscal years.  It is anticipated that the construction costs will not exceed $1,000,000.  It is expected that the designer will develop a system that will adequately meet the needs of the Forest Service with industry standard components and service life without exceeding reasonable cost standards. 

(B) It is anticipated that the Construction Documents will be completed by the end of the 2009-2010 winter season and a construction solicitation will be let by the Forest Service in 2010 for construction to begin in the late summer of 2010.

<b>C.5  Government Rights<br></b>
(A)The Government shall have unlimited rights in all reports, drawings, designs, specifications, notes and other works developed in the performance of this contract without additional compensation paid to the A/E Contractor.  The A/E Contractor hereby grants to the Government a paid-up license through out the world to all such works to which he/she may assert or establish any claim under design patent or copyright laws.  The A/E Contractor, for a period of three years after completion of the project, agrees to furnish the original or copies of all such works on the request of the Contracting Officer.

(B) The Government will assume responsibility for determining suitability of data or work prepared under this contract for use on any other project.  The parties agree the A/E Contractors liability for suitability of drawings, specifications, and other works developed under this contract is limited to contracts for the specific task orders issued under this contract.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Marshall Space FlightCenter (MSFC), intends to negotiate with Science Applications International Corporation(SAIC) only, for a potential 14-month extension, to include a base extension of 8 monthswith six additional 1-month options, for the continued provision of Agency-wideinformation services, MSFC information services, and Integrated Enterprise ManagementProgram (IEMP) integration services under the Unified NASA Information TechnologyServices (UNITeS) contract NNM04AA02C.   The potential period of performance of thecontract effort, if all options are exercised, is through January 31, 2011.SAIC is currently responsible for providing a variety of critical support services in thearea of information technology (IT) as prime contractor for the UNITeS contract. Specifically, the areas supported include:A.   Agency-wide Information Services:	The contractor is responsible for providingsupport for Agency-wide Applications, Digital Television, IT Security, Data CenterServices, Russia IT Services, Wide Area Network Services (via the NASA IntegratedServices Network (NISN),  Systems Management and Operations, Customer Support, IntegratedService Delivery, Mission Engineering and Network Management, Local Area NetworkEngineering, Network Security, Business Studies, Science and Engineering WorkstationProcurement (SEWP) Support, NASA Chief Information Officer (CIO) Support, and InformationTechnology Communications Directorate (ITCD) Support.B.  Integrated Enterprise Management Program (IEMP) Integration Services: The contractoris responsible for providing support for IEMP Integration, Module Project Support, andOperations and Sustaining Support.C.  MSFC Information Services:	The contractor is responsible for providing support forMSFC Applications and Web Services, Computer Systems Services, Customer RequestedHardware Maintenance, Telecommunications Services, IT Security Services, DocumentationRepository, Audio Visual Information Services, IT Procurement Services, Customer Support,Integrated Service Delivery Support, and Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) Support.The draft Requests for Proposal (RFP) for the recompetition of the UNITeS contract werereleased as three distinct solicitations, as all three UNITeS Performance Work Statement(PWS) sections are being recompeted as three separate acquisitions.  PWS Section 3.0,Agencywide Information Services, is being competed as the NASA Integrated CommunicationsServices (NICS) contract. PWS Section 4.0, IEMP Integration Services, is being competedas the Enterprise Applications Service Technologies (EAST) contract.	Finally, PWSSection 5.0, MSFC Information Services, is being competed as the MSFC InformationTechnology Services (MITS) contract.  Both NICS and EAST are under the umbrella of theInformation Technology (IT) Infrastructure Integration Program (I3P) being led by NASAHeadquarters.The release of both the NICS and EAST Draft RFPs occurred while major elements of thegovernance and integration processes were still being formulated by NASA Headquarters. In addition, minor scope decisions for the various I3P contracts are still pending.Further, critical data required by potential offerors as part of the background andhistorical information for the various I3P acquisitions is still being compiled. Therefore, the anticipated release of the NICS and EAST Final RFPs requires delay untilsuch time as all remaining issues relating to I3P contract scope, governance, andintegration have been resolved, all questions have been answered, and all gaps in missinghistorical data have been filled.  As a result, the NICS and EAST schedules require amonth for month slip to the current acquisition schedule to accommodate resolution ofthese remaining issues. The MITS acquisition will provide MSFC, National Space Scienceand Technology Center (NSSTC), and Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) with informationtechnology and communication services. The MITS proposals were received on April 28, 2009with an anticipated award date of November 19, 2009.  Phase-in for MITS is anticipated tobegin on December 1, 2009 with contract full assumption to begin on  February 1, 2010.The original NICS acquisition schedule anticipated release of the NICS and EAST FinalRFPs on or about June 15, 2009, which would have required an extension of the UNITeScontract by a period of approximately 5 months, through April 30, 2010, to accommodateall major acquisition milestones.  This extension would be inclusive of a 60-day phase-inperiod.  Based on the anticipated delay of for the release of all I3P RFPs, the UNITeScontract will require an extension of no less than 8 months to accommodate NICS and EASTacquisition activities.  Further, it is presently anticipated that a phase-in period of90 days will be required for all I3P acquisitions, requiring that at least one of theoptions be exercised, for a total extension of no less than 9 months.The inclusion of the six 1-month option periods, in addition to the 8-month baseextension, is considered necessary in order to accommodate not only the additional timerequired for phase-in but any additional delays in release of the Final RFPs and anyother unanticipated slips to the I3P schedule.	Further, appointment of a permanent NASAChief Information Officer may result in further delays to the I3P schedule until suchtime as an assessment of the I3P initiative has occurred.  Inclusion of the additionaloption periods will therefore serve to not only accommodate further schedule slips butany delays which may be required resulting from such an assessment.  Only those optionsrequired to accommodate all acquisition milestones and NASA Headquarters mandated I3Pholds will be exercised.NASA/MSFC intends to negotiate only with the incumbent contractor, Science ApplicationsInternational Corporation (SAIC) of San Diego, California, for the 14-month extension.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon July 25, 2009.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), for the NHLBI, Division of Intramural Research, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to the University of Pennsylvania, 3900 Delancey Street, Philadelphia, PA., for the purchase and breeding of two (2) additional female dogs to expand the golden retriever X-linked muscular dystrophy (GRMD) colony.   

The sole source determination is based on pre-clinical evaluation of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in a large animal model.  An established dog line, with a defined mutation in the dystrophin gene is considered a clinically relevant model of DMD. These dogs, designated golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD), are not commercially available. Due to the severity of the disease, affected dogs often do not survive long-distant, commercial transportation between sites. Although there are other GRMD colonies in the United States, access to the dogs is restricted. The GRMD dog colony located at University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinarian Medicine (UPenn SVM) is ideally situated for providing affected GRMD dogs to NHLBI, and the proximity of UPenn SVM to the NIH campus enables NHLBI veterinarian staff to travel to Philadelphia and transport dogs under constraint medical care. To change vendors at this time would cause disruption in ongoing research. Therefore, an award to any other source is not feasible or practical.  The contract will be awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13B Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).  

This announcement constitutes the only notice, proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2009-224-DDC. 

The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-34.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611310, and Size Standard $7.0 Million is applicable to this requirement.  

There are no small business set-aside restrictions applicable to this requirement.

 
Market Research conducted by the Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, has determined that the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinarian Medicine is currently the only facility that can supply the animals that meet the government=s specifications.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by July17, 2009, 7:30am Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. 

The Division of Epidemiology Statistics and Prevention Research (DESPR) of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), intends to negotiate, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1, a modification to its current contract no. HHSN267200800009C with the CDM Group, Inc. entitled Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC).  

The Government is interested in obtaining additional information about the development of cardiovascular and obesity risk factors in this cohort during high school and the transition into the first year after high school.  This modification will incorporate to the study a collection of additional anthropomorphic and biologic assessments in the nationally-representative cohort of 10th-grade students currently enrolled in this study.  The additional assessments will include height, weight, waist circumference, lipids, C-reactive protein, cotinine, uric acid, fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, physical activity, diet, geographic information systems (GIS) coordinates, and DNA.  The survey implementation phase will be starting in the next months; the longitudinal cohort is currently being recruited by the CDM Group with the requirement that confidentiality is maintained for all identifying data.  As a result, the NICHD does not have legal rights to the identifying data on this original cohort of participants.  Consequently, the cohort could not be transferred to any other contractor by the NICHD.  In order to perform the continued work, a new prospective contractor would need access to a comparable cohort of students, similar in age, that have completed the previously contracted assessments immediately before conducting the additional anthropomorphic and biologic assessments.  With the exception of the incumbent contractor, the CDM Group, there is no other source presently known to the NICHD that has access to such a cohort and ownership of the data gathered prior to these additional assessments.   In addition, it will cost the Government additional time and effort to recruit and duplicate the initial contracted study.  All of the factors taken together make the CDM Group uniquely qualified for performing this additional part of the study.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this phase of the study which provides for additional follow-up and data collection. 

This is not a request for proposals.  However, if any responsible source believes it can perform the above requirement, they may submit three (3) copies of their capability statement for consideration by the NICHD to Alice M. Pagn, Contract Specialist, at the mailing and email address provided within 45 days of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must document access to a comparable nationally-representative cohort of students, similar in age, that have been subjected to a comparable assessment during the 2009-2010 school year.  All responses must be received in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NICHD to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

NO COLLECT CALLS OR FACSIMILE TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED. RESPONDENTS MAY SUBMIT THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS VIA E-MAIL IN ADDITION TO 3 HARD COPIES.

The general scope of FTSS services encompasses the following:  Contractor Operations and Maintenance Services (COMS) (including the following: Training Device Operations, Maintenance, Supply Support, Information Assurance (IA), Technical Data Verification (TDV), Access Control, Janitorial, Trainer Modification Support, Trainer Space Prep), Contractor Instruction Services (CIS), Training Device Relocation (TDR), Training Systems Management (TSM), Training Device Modification (TDM), Spares and Product Support, and In-Service Engineering Office (ISEO) Support.  (ISEO Support is ancillary to COMS support.)  Two separate Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity Contracts (ID/IQC), each with multiple awards is anticipated.<br><br>

The ceiling estimate of the acquisition is $900,000,000 for the Unrestricted Multiple Award Contract (MAC) and $80,000,000 for the Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA) MAC, inclusive of all contracts awarded and all subsequent task orders issued during the ordering period, which is anticipated to last five years, plus three one-year options (if exercised). Task orders will include Aviation, Surface, Undersea and Cross Warfare FTSS service efforts acquired by NAWCTSD. <br><br>

Presently, FTSS services are being provided primarily under numerous five-year task orders awarded under the existing FTSS II multiple award, ID/IQC; the ordering period of which ends in 30 March 2010. It is anticipated that future FTSS requirements and follow-on acquisitions to current FTSS service efforts will fall within the FTSS III scope. <br><br>

The FTSS III follow-on vehicles are two MACs  one MAC based upon full and open competition for FTSS requirements of higher complexity and performance risk, which also is referred to as the Unrestricted MAC, and one MAC set-aside in total for small business, which is referred to as the SBSA MAC.  Any size firm can compete to become an awardee in the Unrestricted MAC.  Only small businesses can compete to become an awardee in the SBSA MAC.  This will be a competitive, negotiated acquisition with contract awards based upon the best value trade-off analysis evaluation criteria stipulated in Section M of the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP). Selection of offers for award will be based on the evaluation of written proposals.  <br><br>

A draft version of the RFP, including applicable attachments is released at http://www.fedbizopps.gov and the NAWCTSD Business Opportunities site at http://nawctsd.navair.navy.mil.  A technical library containing historical information for the Unrestricted and Small Business Set-Aside MACs is posted on the NAWCTSD Business Opportunities site.<br><br>

Industry is encouraged to provide the Government point of contact identified in this posting with comments and feedback via email in response to the Draft RFP.  Please provide all comments and feedback by no later than 19 August 2009.  <br><br>

A pre-solicitation conference is anticipated to be held at Naval Station (NS) Norfolk on 14 August 2009.  At this time, the Government does not anticipate a separate pre-proposal conference.  See Draft RFP, Section L, for information about conference and site visits.<br><br>

The distribution of the final solicitation will be accomplished through FedBizOpps and the NAWCTSD Business Opportunities site.  Hard copies of the solicitation documents will not be available.<br><br>
 
Contract awards are scheduled for May 2010. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330, and the small business size standard is $27 million.<br><br>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Emergency Response Team in Erlanger, Kentucky in accordance with Federal Acquisition Requlation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to award a sole source purchase order to Reasearch Systems, Inc alsodoing business as ITT Visual Inormation Soultions for the purchase of one (1)ENVI+IDL Windows Node Locked License.  The ENVI software is used for digital processing of the agency's chemical detection and imaging capabilities on the Airborne Spectral Photometric Environment Collection Technology (ASPECT).  The ASPECT aircraft was recently equipped with radiation detectors which require similar processing requirements as the chemical and imaging capabilities.  A new member of the ASPECT team needs this software to be able to independently process radiation data and write IDL (interactive data language) algorithms for radiological missions.   The ENVI software is based on IDL and is the only language with the existing software used by the ASPECT program.  Using another software or programming code would incur substantial costs to reprogram, test, and validate the code.  ENVI+IDL software also provides a continuity of operations for the team and improves the agency's "reach-back" capacity for the program.  The National American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this requirement is: 541511.  The EPA has only one known source for the procurement that is in the government's best interest.  If there are any other potential sources, please submit your capability statement via email to the U.S. EPA c./o Elaine Scott at: scott.elaine@epa.gov no later than 12 noon, EST July 15, 2009.  You may also address your questions and/or comments at this email address as well.  NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.

STATEMENT OF WORKTechnical Support for the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR Program Northern Virginia Pilot
I.  Background
The Home Performance with ENERGY STAR Program, as well as other Energy Star initiatives are all voluntary pollution prevention programs sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency's Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD).  The primary goal of these Programs is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants through reduced energy consumption.The goal of the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR (HPwES) is to encourage homeowners to make comprehensive energy efficiency improvements to their homes. Quality Assurance (QA) is a very important component of the HPwES program and helps to ensure that homeowners get actual energy savings and that the reputation of the ENERGY STAR "brand" is protected. More information about HPwES can be found at www.energystar.gov/hpwessponsors.EPA, working with the Department of Energy, plan to test pilot a HPwES program model with direct partnerships with home performance contractors and oversight by an independent agent. This pilot will test a new quality assurance approach and marketing a performance metric. A copy of the draft pilot plan can be obtained by sending a request to homeperformance@energystar.gov.   
II.  Purpose
The purpose of the Task Order is for the Contractor to accredit (verify) that home performance contractors, participating in a pilot HPwES program in Northern Virginia, meet the program eligibility requirements and follow standard operating procedures (SOPs) for evaluating home energy efficiency and completing home energy efficiency improvements. In addition, the Contractor will provide guidance to home performance contractors on how to establish Quality Management Systems (QMS) to record and track home performance and business metrics for each job. This guidance may include, but is not limited to, explaining the requirements and protocols to home performance contractors in writing and presentations. The Contractor shall also provide protocols for electronic data transfer so that home performance contractors can easily submit information on their work for review and evaluation.
The Contractor staff shall at all times identify themselves as Contractor employees and shall not present themselves as EPA employees.  Furthermore, they shall not represent the views of the U. S. Government, EPA, or its employees.  In addition, the Contractor shall not engage in inherently government activities, including but not limited to actual determination of EPA policy and preparation of documents on EPA letterhead.
III.  Required Personnel
The optimal organization to perform the work in this task order shall have personnel with expertise in accrediting residential building performance companies including the review of business Quality Management Systems of home improvement and weatherization businesses.   The personnel shall have experience and a proven understanding of the HPwES program, the requirements of the pilot HPwES program, and building science.  The organization shall have personnel with knowledge of information technology and electronic data transfer standards.  The Contractor may obtain the services of subcontractors if necessary to gain additional expertise for the tasks covered under this task order.
IV.  Tasks
Task 1Accredit (verify) that home performance contractors seeking to participate in the pilot HPwES program meet the eligibility requirements and follow standard operating procedures (SOPs) for evaluating home energy efficiency and completing home energy efficiency improvements  This will be done by visiting the contractor's place of business for the accreditation interview.  The Contractor will collect a fee from contractors to cover at least half (?) the cost of the accreditation activity.   
The requirements for contractors to participate in the pilot HPwES program are as follows:"	Commitment and ability to perform a comprehensive home energy assessment according to consensus-based, building science SOPs;"	Commitment and ability to install energy efficiency improvements according to local codes and consensus-based, building science SOPs;"	Commitment and ability to use quality management systems to record and track home performance and business metrics for each job;"	Have $1 million in general inability insurance; "	Have workers compensation insurance; and"	Have registrations, licensing and/or bonding documentation that is required by state or local government to conduct business.
The accreditation shall consist of four parts:1)	Meet face to face with the home performance contractors to review records, equipment and personnel qualifications in order to determine if the pilot program requirements have been satisfied.2)	Routinely collect and review information from participating contractors to determine if SOPs are followed. This will include in-home inspections of 5% (percent) of all jobs completed to ensure that work was done to program requirements.  Report a summary of jobs completed by participating contractors on a quarterly basis to the EPA Task Order Project Officer (TOPO).3)	Distribute and collect customer satisfaction surveys on jobs done by participating contractors; and4)	Annually accredit that participating contractors meet the requirements of the pilot and have completed any agreed upon improvements to their business quality management systems.
The Contractor will be expected to begin accrediting home performance contractors one month after a contract is awarded.  The EPA TOPO will provide a list of potential contractors that are interested in participating in the pilot program.  The Contractor will provide the EPA TOPO with the name, address, email address and phone number of each accredited home performance contractor within 5 business days after completing a verification/review.  The Contractor will provide the EPA TOPO with a written summary report quarterly, that includes the number of jobs completed by each accredited home performance contractor, results from customer satisfaction surveys (sent and returned), and activities to review if SOPs are being followed.

Task 2Provide guidance to home performance contractors on internal business and technical Quality Management Systems (QMS).  QMS is a set of policies and procedures an organization commits to follow to ensure the delivery of quality building performance contracting services which includes, but is not limited to quality planning, quality control, quality assurance and quality improvement. The guidance should make it clear to contractors what practices and policies they need to adopt to establish an internal business quality management system, why it is important, and all the steps necessary to meet quality assurance requirements to participate in the pilot HPwES program.  Guidance can be delivered through multiple media including, printed documents, web site, video, seminar, workshop or one-on-one consultation.  The Contractor will provide the EPA TOPO with a quarterly summary of all documents and methods used to provide guidance to contractors. 

Task 3Develop an electronic data transfer standard protocol (i.e. XML) to electronically transmit information between participating contractors and the Contractor.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) / Capability Request For Information (CRFI)
<p>United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Soaring Program Sailplane Fleet Replacement</p>
<p>1.0 General Introduction<br />The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Capabilities Integration Directorate is conducting analyses in support of the acquisition of non-powered flight capability at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). This is a combined SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS)/ CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (CRFI) to explore cost effective acquisition options to provide this capability at the USAFA by March, 2010. This effort is for the purchase of a government owned fleet of 19 aircraft; 14 dual seat basic gliders and 5 dual seat aerobatic/advanced gliders. Information provided in your response will be used for planning the acquisition strategy of the near term procurement. At this time, we anticipate this to be a full and open competition, though it is still to be determined if foreign participation will be permitted.</p>
<p>Contact Captain John Machuca, Program Manager (ASC/XRE), at (937)904-5867 or (937)674-5867 to express your interest ahead of the response deadline. Submit an electronic copy via e-mail to AF POC's listed in section 6.0 no later than 3 Aug 2009. Additionally, provide two printed (hard) copies of each response either by mail or hand delivery to Attn: Capt Machuca, ASC/XRE, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 022, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-7209 no later than 3 Aug 2009.</p>
<p>2.0 Description<br />ASC is seeking information to determine the most cost-effective acquisition strategy to fulfill the need for 19 glider aircraft by March 2010 to replace the existing fleet of basic and aerobatic training gliders used in the USAFA Soaring Program. Existing USAFA facilities will be used for aircraft storage and maintenance, however the aircraft will be maintained under a separate Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) arrangement. (Note: If you are unable to meet the 1 Mar 2010 suspense your response is still welcomed. However, in your response please provide data explaining why you are unable to meet the suspense and offer your proposed delivery timetable.)<br />The current aircraft requirement is for basic (14 each) and aerobatic model (5 each) non-powered sailplane gliders, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified aircraft suitable for basic soaring training. Due to the urgency of the timeline, it is preferred that the aircraft supplied be currently in production or in-stock, however, ASC remains open to other suitable acquisition options that are able to meet timeline requirements. Also, while it is preferred that a single manufacturer provide both the basic and aerobatic aircraft for standardization of training and maintenance purposes, the Air Force is fully dedicated to fair and open competition, and as such there is no requirement that a single manufacturer be able to produce both aircraft.</p>
<p>3.0 Summary<br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS) / CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (CRFI) ONLY to identify sources and acquisition options to acquire 19 aircraft in support of a non-powered flight program at the USAFA. The information provided in the SSS/CRFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. ASC has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this SSS/CRFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC><p>The 22nd Contracting Squadron is publicizing this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE in order to gather industry information and input with respect to a potential Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) program at McConnell AFB, KS. No solicitation is being issued at this time. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result. The Air Force will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. Any future solicitation, including specifications and/or drawings, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/). Interested Parties are solely responsible for monitoring the aforementioned website for the release of a solicitation package and/or any updates and/or amendments.<br />The government is seeking to identify qualified, experienced, and interested potential businesses capable of performing the type of work as described herein. The envisioned MACC program would consist of multiple, firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts to provide a vehicle for executing a broad range of maintenance, repair and new construction of buildings, facilities, or base infrastructure, performed under a design/build or just build process. In general, MACC program contractors would be given fair opportunity to compete for projects described in individual task order solicitations and would be expected to accomplish a wide variety of construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, and new construction integrating multiple construction trades/disciplines. Work may include full project design from a concept or performance-oriented statement of work. In-house design capability or ready access to design capability is a must for projects under MACC. For the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI), the anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 23-Construction Industry series, excluding 237310, with a size standard of $33,500,000. All interested parties are invited to respond and must be currently registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (http://www.ccr.gov/).</p>
<p>The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Should a future requirement evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated that as many as five (5) contracts could be awarded, each for a term consisting of one base year plus four, 1-year option periods. Task Orders written against MACC contracts are anticipated to range between $2,000 and $5,000,000. The overall program value is still under consideration; accordingly, at this point it is roughly anticipated to range between $50,000,000 and $100,000,000 over a five-year period.</p>
<p>If your firm has an interest in proposing on future requirements as described above, please prepare and transmit a Capability Statement to Beth Holman or Bill Carbrey via mail addressed to 22 CONS/LGCA, 53147 Kansas St, Ste 102, Bldg 32, McConnell AFB, KS 67221-3606, fax to (316) 759-5634, or email to beth.holman@mcconnell.af.mil and bill.carbrey@mcconnell.af.mil, not later than 4:00 PM CDT, 24 July 2009. If emailing your response, please note that due to increased firewall protections some emails may be blocked; therefore, follow-up via telephone (if an acknowledgement is not received back via email) is strongly recommended to ensure receipt of your submission by the Government.</p>
<p>Request Capability Statements address the following:</p>
<p>1. Company name, address, point of contact (POC), telephone number, fax number, email address, CAGE Code, DUNS Number, and GSA schedules held.</p>
<p>2. Company's business size, to include number of employees and average annual receipts for the last three fiscal years (please indicate fiscal period), and number of years in the construction industry.</p>
<p>3. Applicable business size and/or socioeconomic statuses (i.e. Large Business, Small Business, Emerging Small Business, SBA Certified 8A Program Participant, SBA Certified HUB Zone Firm, Small Disadvantaged Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business, Veteran Owned Business, Woman Owned Business).</p>

<SUBJECT>Information Request for the Objective Simulation Framework Capability for the Ballistic Missile Defense System
<SOLNBR>HQ0006-XX-RFI_Objective_Simulation_Framework
<RESPDATE>080409
<ARCHDATE>08052009
<CONTACT>Edward A. Langwinski, Contracting Officer, Phone 2564501412, Email edward.langwinski@mda.mil
<DESC>1. Background:  Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack.

2. Description:

a. Request for Information (RFI).  MDA is seeking sources to enhance its current suite of modeling and simulation (M&S) frameworks.  The current frameworks (the Digital Simulation Architecture [DSA] and the Single Stimulation Framework [SSF]) integrate models from each of the BMDS program elements into a system that accurately represents the performance of fielded BMDS equipment against a variety of threats in realistic environments.  The desired framework, hereafter called Objective Simulation Framework (OSF), will leverage existing or mature capabilities, develop common interfaces, or propose a combination of both, to join digital and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) representations into a modular, scalable, reconfigurable, and compose-able system.  The RFI is seeking contractors who are able to design, develop, test, field and maintain an OSF that can be used for a variety of applications to include BMDS ground tests and performance assessments.  Additionally, the OSF, in its various configurations, will meet warfighter requirements for wargames, exercises and training events, as well as the system engineers requirements for concept analysis, and element requirements for element integration.  Data collection, centralized execution controls, and common models such as threats, lethality, and phenomenology are functions required to be addressed by the OSF. 

b. Design Objective.  By evolving this desired OSF, the Governments objective is to integrate digital M&S capabilities with the HWIL M&S capabilities.  This evolution would include complete data collection capabilities across the M&S system to support BMDS system level analysis with common threats, lethality, and phenomenology models.

c. BMDS Elements.  The BMDS elements include the following:

(1) Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense 
(2) Airborne Laser (ABL)
(3) Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD)
(4) Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target (PATRIOT)
(5) Sensors 
          -  COBRA DANE
          -  Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX)
          -  Upgraded Early Warning Radars (UEWRs)
          -  Ballistic Missile Early Warning Systems (BMEWS)
          -  Forward Based X-Band Transportable (FBX-T) Radar AN/TPY-2/TPS-X/Forward
            Deployable Radar (FDR) 
(6) Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS)
(7) Defense Support Program (DSP) / Space-Based Infra-Red System (SBIRS)
(8) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
(9) Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communication (C2BMC)

d. Future Systems.  The description does not fully account for all future element models that may be represented in the OSF.  Each future element model may require one or more digital and HWIL simulations to enable engineering, development, testing of that element.  Thus, while each future system may be developed at different times and to different specifications, the design must allow these systems to be compatible with the developed OSF.  Moreover, since multiple nodes with associated hardware and software may be required at a number of locations, the developed OSF communication system between these locations must be secure and variably configured depending on the number of participating nodes.  In addition, the framework should be able to operate in a variety of classified environments (including unclassified, collateral, and multinational).  Finally, concurrent operation of the OSF during element or system-level testing must not interfere with the normal operation of each elements primary operational mission.

e. OSF Desired End-State.  The OSF desired end-state is the full integration of digital and HWIL capabilities.  OSF will provide the framework and defined interface standards supporting the system-level capability.  The integration methodology should maximize interoperability while considering the geographical separation of MDA operating locations.  The performance of individual models will be the responsibility of the elements.  The OSF must be able to run in real time and non-real time (faster and slower than real time).  It must also support models that run in real time and non-real time, and that use either discrete event stepping or time stepping.  The OSF design must permit effective operation with all current MDA digital and/or HWIL representations and operate within the current and anticipated MDA infrastructure for execution, data recording, and analysis.  The proposed OSF solution would include a complete data collection capability across the M&S single system to support BMDS system level analysis.  The OSF must provide common threat and environmental information to all models.  The categories of common threat and environment include phenomenology, lethality, environment, communications, and threat.  Finally, OSF must be able to operate in either a purely digital environment, a purely HWIL one, or a hybrid.

f. OSF Use Cases.  The OSF must be able to support the following use cases: 

(1) Ground Testing.  BMDS-level M&S supporting virtual and live ground tests of configurations of BMDS operational and development assets to verify performance, exchange information, and assess system behavior. 

(2) Training.  BMDS-level M&S supporting activities enabling battle staffs to develop proficiency in planning and applying BMDS assets in live simulated scenarios.

(3) Exercises.  BMDS-level M&S supporting activities in which BMDS operators and commanders practice skills and apply BMDS concepts of operation (CONOPS) and tactics, techniques and procedure (TTPs) in live simulations using scenarios containing current system and threat capabilities.

(4) Element Integration.  The elements use BMDS-level M&S to drive their prime mission equipment components to assess the effectiveness of the components, verify requirements, perform trade studies, and evaluate interfaces and interoperability.

(5) Performance Assessment. BMDS-level M&S supporting performance assessment of fielded BMDS configurations to verify the capability of a BMDS configuration to meet system-level quantitative measures of effectiveness (MOEs) or performance (MOPs) against specified threat scenarios.

(6) Wargames. BMDS-level M&S supports virtual wargaming activities to perform human-in-the-loop experimentation for developing new BMDS CONOPS and TTPs and complement international BMD cooperative ventures.

(7) Concept Analysis. BMDS-level M&S supporting constructive simulation for BMDS-level concept analysis including needs determination, concept exploration, and trade studies of BMDS alternatives.

g. Place of performance.  Includes, but not limited to, facilities in the following locations: National Capitol Region; Huntsville, Alabama; Colorado Springs, Colorado, Sunnyvale, California; Los Angeles, California; Tucson, Arizona; Fort Greely, Alaska; Honolulu, Hawaii; Omaha, Nebraska; Dahlgren, Virginia; Boston, Massachusetts as well as other potential MDA CONUS and OCONUS locations.  

h. Government-Furnished Information (GFI) / Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE).  GFI/GFE is TBD.  OSF design may require access to other suppliers proprietary information and equipment.  As such, any resulting solicitation and proposal will require that the vendor negotiate agreements with these suppliers and contractors to obtain any such information or equipment.

3. Responses:  The intended outcome of this synopsis is to determine interest and capability in supporting the OSF development.  

MDA is requesting contractors interested in this acquisition submit a capability statement that demonstrates core capabilities and expertise.  Capability statements are limited to a maximum of ten pages excluding the cover page.  Capability statements in excess of 10 pages may not be reviewed.

<DESC>Market Survey for vendors capable of furthering RUN TIME MANAGER/INDEPENDENT SIMULATION MODEL/AFTER ACTION REVIEW SYSTEM.<BR><BR>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Constructive Simulation (CONSIM) has a requirement for continued development of Run Time Manager (RTM), Independent Simulation Model  (ISM) and the After Action Review System (AARS)   systems under the Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC) program.  The estimated value of this Cost Plus Fixed Fee award is approximately $2.5 M per year, for a total period of performance of 3 years.  Efforts include software development, integration , testing of developed software, sustainment of existing RTM/ISM/AARS) systems.  The contractor would continue the ongoing software development, training and integration, and augment the existing vendors effort to provide exercise fielding support critical to the RTM/ISM/AARS systems inside and outside the (JLCCTC).  This exercise support is both CONUS and OCONUS.  Award for this required effort is expected in Dec 2009.  The existing systems are detailed below:<BR><BR>Run Time Manager (RTM)<BR>RTM system that supports the simulation to Command Control Communications Computers  Intelligence (C4I) systems.  This system processes simulation data by providing usable/valid information to and from the Army and Joint (C4I) systems.  This simulation to stimulation and the stimulation to (C4I) constitutes a complete thread that begins with simulation and ends with the (C4I).  This system must manage the data between these systems and in many cases, create data so the information can be more accurately depicted on the (C4I) systems.  Continued development and sustainment of the existing system with no interruptions in service would be required.  Source code and operations manuals would be provided by the existing vendor.<BR><BR>Independent Simulation Model (ISM)<BR>ISM is a system that provides a comprehensive, integrated tool set for full life cycle support of simulation-driven, master scenario event list (MSEL), to support training the (C4I) audience with (C4I) stimulation with or without the federation.  This system allows planners and trainers to shape the environment by setting realistic conditions of organic unit (C4I) devices.  Again existing source code and operations manuals would be provide by the existing vendor.<BR><BR>After Action Review System (AARS)<BR>AARS is a system that collects data from the federation and provides the after action review system and operators the ability to manage (reduce and analyze) the collected data and develop visual products (slides, charts, graphs) that provide useful information to facilitate the commanders after action review process.  Again existing source code and operations manual would be available from the existing vendor.<BR><BR>The Government is looking for sources who can meet this requirement.  Information from any sources able to meet the requirements will be reviewed for consideration.  Any submittals should be proved no later than 24 July 09 Eastern Standard Time to the PCO via electronic submissions at milton.washington@us.army.mil. The point of contact for information regarding this action is Milton Washington at (407) 381-8854.<BR>DISCLAIMER: This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products. <BR> <BR>This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.

Specifically, an existing asphalt/concrete parking lot will be replaced; existing lagging and pile walls and an intricate web of existing underground utilities as well as a network of abandoned piles will be worked into upper and lower level park spaces. The two park spaces will be connected by way of stairways and an elevator. The lower level park sits within the 50 year floodway. The local sponsor has constructed a grid of 24inch diameter auger cast piles. The piles will support a 52' x 184' park building housing a fountain equipment room; an area of which is dedicated to public restrooms (24' x 40') and other future uses. The exposed facades of the building will be clad in 3inch granite, 3inch sandstone and metal panels. Its structure will include concrete pile caps, concrete floors, concrete columns and a concrete roof structure. The building's MEP system includes a geothermal well field and other specialized equipment. The building's interior consists of glazed concrete masonry units, stainless steel fixtures and a specialized suspended ceiling system in addition to a network of pumps, filters, tanks, chemical equipment and a control system shared by all three water features. Four feet above the building's insulated and waterproofed roof sits the upper level plaza and includes a customized elevator with glass doors within a stone/metal/glass tower sized to house exhaust ventilation and elevator equipment, a 34' square computer programmable interactive water feature with 41 jets, a 100' long custom fabricated steel pergola with structural glass paving and three 8' x 10' structural glass paved balconies sporting a computer programmable water curtain cascading into a basin 15' below, site furnishings/lighting including custom stainless steel guardrails, and irrigated tree planting areas utilizing an engineered structural soil matrix. A 15' wide x 40' long subsurface utility vault will be provided to service this project as well as future phases and adjacent ongoing construction projects. Two inch and 3inch granite pavers cover the remaining area. A stairway with stainless steel lighted handrails 22' to 40' wide descends 18'. The solid granite stair treads are centered between a 20' to 28' wide water cascade to the west and a 10' wide water cascade to the east; each including programmable features. In addition, an irrigated tree planting area sits 4' above the stair structure within a stair landing. The lower level park plaza includes 10' to 40' wide stairways and a 60' long sloped walk connecting the park to the neighboring public roadway. A 100' long loggia directly below the pergola provides protected access to the fountain equipment building and public restrooms. Ten foot to 50' long x 1' wide water basins include computer programmable features. Solid and clad stone walls, site furnishings/lighting, an 8' x 15' irrigated tree planting area, 2inch and 3inch granite pavers as well as concrete paving are also included in the construction.<BR><BR>Contract duration is 500 days and estimated cost range is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.

1.0  Background

In August 2007, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration and DoD Chief Information Officer (ASD(NII/DoD CIO)) to develop and implement a comprehensive approach for safeguarding DoD unclassified information concerning weapons systems, technology, and combat capabilities when it resides on DIB unclassified networks.  To facilitate this effort, the Defense Industrial Base Cyber Security/ Information Assurance Task Force (DIB CS/IA TF) was established to work with DIB partners and DoD components to develop the processes and capabilities needed to secure this information from sophisticated adversaries.  In particular, a technology and architecture team comprising DIB and Government technical experts was chartered to investigate innovative, future-looking approaches to todays problems.   

1.1 Intent of the RFI
It is the intent of the ASD(NII/DOD) CIO office to use this market research to explore the feasibility and maturity of virtualization-based security  solutions and identify organizations which have plans to or experience in providing them.  The DIB Task Force will consider whether this approach has promise for protecting DoD unclassified information on DIB networks.  Specifically, the DIB Task Force is interested  in exploring the availability of virtualization-based commercial solutions for the following problems in network security.:

1)    Network hygiene provisioning via virtual infrastructure;
2a)  Reduced-risk Internet exposure via virtual machines;
2b)  Creation of a trusted enclave via virtual machines; 
3)    Employer-subsidized computers replacing employer-supplied computers.

The technology and architecture team will use these RFI responses to gauge the maturity of virtualization as an approach and the capabilities of specific companies to provide solutions.

2.0  Information Requested
2.1 Descriptions of the problems and exemplary use cases follow below:

1)  Network Provisioning:  The large number of components in and resultant complexity of todays network topologies make it difficult to determine the security posture of a network, much less maintain it in a desired state. Request #1 asks for solutions using virtualization to centrally create and manage images of controlled state and use them to rapidly provision network components.

Questions/Discussion:  Today configuration management of network components is generally performed case-by-case, scanning components for current state and applying patches, new settings, etc to bring the component into compliance with the desired new state. The configuration management controls operate under control of the operating system being managed. With the decoupling of logical and physical aspects of many network components (servers, hosts, others?) now possible through virtualization, can we now think about replacing piecemeal configuration of guest environments with updated images? 

Specific issues to address:  
	How often to refresh?  Refresh as prophylactic.  
	Relationship to Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) (see http://scap.nist.gov/ for more information).
	Do you have a solution or a tool that works this way?   Please describe.

2)  The attack surface of modern operating systems and many applications is too large to effectively secure.  It may be that the era of monolithic general purpose operating systems is nearing its end and could be replaced by a cluster of modules or virtual appliances acting in concert to perform services traditionally supplied by operating systems. Two such components, based on virtual machine technology, are described below. The first is designed for isolating risky environments to support safe Internet access and the other for isolating sensitive activity. It may be that the operating system of the future will consist of one or more of each of these components along with components yet to be described.

2a)  Reduce exposure:  Many of todays attacks come in through the browser or email.  Some are blatant, where the user is tricked into downloading and opening a file containing malware which then installs itself on the host; other less so, exploiting flaws in the browser to allow the malicious agent through. Either way, it seems clear that isolating risky activities like browsing and email in a non-persistent virtual machine separate from the users mission environment would make us safer, yet we are mostly not doing that.

Specific issues to address: 
	What, if anything, is missing from making this a common approach?
	How should session persistence, like bookmarks, be managed? 
	What might need to be done to support the selective movement of information from the safe browsing environment into the users environment?  
	Do you have a solution or a tool to meet this need? What are the limitations of your tool and why do you think it is safe?

2b) Trusted Enclave: This enclave would be used for performing sensitive operations or handling sensitive information. Virtual machines  (VMs) supporting this capability could be provisioned independent of the host operating system and refreshed from trusted sources when enough risk has accumulated to justify doing so. One way to do this is a hot spares approach: provision duplicated VMs, load the application into the first one and migrate it to the second one after a certain level of risk has been reached. The first one would then be refreshed from an immutable source and when the second one has reached a risky state the process would be reversed.  This could be done monolithically or surgically.

Specific issues to address: 
	How do you move useful information between this enclave and the outside world?
	Whats the potential to securely connect this environment to that described above (Case 2) without communicating malicious agents? 
	How do you measure the level of corruption in the enclave? 
	What triggers the switch? 
	Can the VMs be seamlessly migrated back and forth? 
	 Is it all or nothing, or can environments themselves be partitioned?
	There are a number of standards and APIs which are emerging in Virtual Machine Management, Virtual Machine Control and Virtual Machine Format. Which standards do you support and which task force or standards body (IETF, DMTF, ISO, ) do you expect  these standards to emerge from?

2c) Whose laptop?: It is becoming more common in businesses to replace company provided/company managed laptops with company subsidized employee purchases. One such initiative is described at http://money.cnn.com/2009/04/13/technology/fortt_choice.fortune/index.htm.  In this example, the employee owns the platform and provides the local administration. The company supports remote access for the employee by supplying a managed corporate image authorized to connect to its network.

Questions/Discussion: In the never ending effort to streamline costs, some in corporate America are changing how employee IT is provided. Instead of providing and managing a complete package of hardware and software for each worker, they are subsidizing the hardware and managing the software image which connect that hardware into the corporate network. These solutions may use virtualization to separate the corporate image from the users image; they may use remote display technology to centrally maintain the corporate image. The remote connection must be protected from the device connecting into it. 

Specific issues to address: 

	What solutions are available that effectively protect a corporate managed image on an unmanaged platform? 
	Are there remote attestation mechanisms to provide evidence to the corporate network that the connection should be allowed?

1.0  Background

In August 2007, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration and DoD Chief Information Officer (ASD(NII/DoD CIO)) to develop and implement a comprehensive approach for safeguarding DoD unclassified information concerning weapons systems, technology, and combat capabilities when it resides on DIB unclassified networks.  To facilitate this effort, the Defense Industrial Base Cyber Security/ Information Assurance Task Force (DIB CS/IA TF) was established to work with DIB partners and DoD components to develop the processes and capabilities needed to secure this information from sophisticated adversaries.  In particular, a technology and architecture team comprising DIB and Government technical experts was chartered to investigate innovative, future-looking approaches to todays problems.   

1.1 Intent of the RFI
It is the intent of the ASD(NII/DOD) CIO office to use this market research to explore the feasibility and maturity of virtualization-based security  solutions and identify organizations which have plans to or experience in providing them.  The DIB Task Force will consider whether this approach has promise for protecting DoD unclassified information on DIB networks.  Specifically, the DIB Task Force is interested  in exploring the availability of virtualization-based commercial solutions for the following problems in network security.:

1)    Network hygiene provisioning via virtual infrastructure;
2a)  Reduced-risk Internet exposure via virtual machines;
2b)  Creation of a trusted enclave via virtual machines; 
3)    Employer-subsidized computers replacing employer-supplied computers.

The technology and architecture team will use these RFI responses to gauge the maturity of virtualization as an approach and the capabilities of specific companies to provide solutions.

2.0  Information Requested
2.1 Descriptions of the problems and exemplary use cases follow below:

1)  Network Provisioning:  The large number of components in and resultant complexity of todays network topologies make it difficult to determine the security posture of a network, much less maintain it in a desired state. Request #1 asks for solutions using virtualization to centrally create and manage images of controlled state and use them to rapidly provision network components.

Questions/Discussion:  Today configuration management of network components is generally performed case-by-case, scanning components for current state and applying patches, new settings, etc to bring the component into compliance with the desired new state. The configuration management controls operate under control of the operating system being managed. With the decoupling of logical and physical aspects of many network components (servers, hosts, others?) now possible through virtualization, can we now think about replacing piecemeal configuration of guest environments with updated images? 

Specific issues to address:  
	How often to refresh?  Refresh as prophylactic.  
	Relationship to Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) (see http://scap.nist.gov/ for more information).
	Do you have a solution or a tool that works this way?   Please describe.

2)  The attack surface of modern operating systems and many applications is too large to effectively secure.  It may be that the era of monolithic general purpose operating systems is nearing its end and could be replaced by a cluster of modules or virtual appliances acting in concert to perform services traditionally supplied by operating systems. Two such components, based on virtual machine technology, are described below. The first is designed for isolating risky environments to support safe Internet access and the other for isolating sensitive activity. It may be that the operating system of the future will consist of one or more of each of these components along with components yet to be described.

2a)  Reduce exposure:  Many of todays attacks come in through the browser or email.  Some are blatant, where the user is tricked into downloading and opening a file containing malware which then installs itself on the host; other less so, exploiting flaws in the browser to allow the malicious agent through. Either way, it seems clear that isolating risky activities like browsing and email in a non-persistent virtual machine separate from the users mission environment would make us safer, yet we are mostly not doing that.

Specific issues to address: 
	What, if anything, is missing from making this a common approach?
	How should session persistence, like bookmarks, be managed? 
	What might need to be done to support the selective movement of information from the safe browsing environment into the users environment?  
	Do you have a solution or a tool to meet this need? What are the limitations of your tool and why do you think it is safe?

2b) Trusted Enclave: This enclave would be used for performing sensitive operations or handling sensitive information. Virtual machines  (VMs) supporting this capability could be provisioned independent of the host operating system and refreshed from trusted sources when enough risk has accumulated to justify doing so. One way to do this is a hot spares approach: provision duplicated VMs, load the application into the first one and migrate it to the second one after a certain level of risk has been reached. The first one would then be refreshed from an immutable source and when the second one has reached a risky state the process would be reversed.  This could be done monolithically or surgically.

Specific issues to address: 
	How do you move useful information between this enclave and the outside world?
	Whats the potential to securely connect this environment to that described above (Case 2) without communicating malicious agents? 
	How do you measure the level of corruption in the enclave? 
	What triggers the switch? 
	Can the VMs be seamlessly migrated back and forth? 
	 Is it all or nothing, or can environments themselves be partitioned?
	There are a number of standards and APIs which are emerging in Virtual Machine Management, Virtual Machine Control and Virtual Machine Format. Which standards do you support and which task force or standards body (IETF, DMTF, ISO, ) do you expect  these standards to emerge from?

2c) Whose laptop?: It is becoming more common in businesses to replace company provided/company managed laptops with company subsidized employee purchases. One such initiative is described at http://money.cnn.com/2009/04/13/technology/fortt_choice.fortune/index.htm.  In this example, the employee owns the platform and provides the local administration. The company supports remote access for the employee by supplying a managed corporate image authorized to connect to its network.

Questions/Discussion: In the never ending effort to streamline costs, some in corporate America are changing how employee IT is provided. Instead of providing and managing a complete package of hardware and software for each worker, they are subsidizing the hardware and managing the software image which connect that hardware into the corporate network. These solutions may use virtualization to separate the corporate image from the users image; they may use remote display technology to centrally maintain the corporate image. The remote connection must be protected from the device connecting into it.

	Are there remote attestation mechanisms to provide evidence to the corporate network that the connection should be allowed?

<DESC><p>Headquarters Air Combat Command, Acquisition Management and Integration Center (HQ ACC/AMIC), Langley AFB VA, intends to award a non-competitive, sole source, bridge contract award for a one month base and two one (1) month option to Kforce Government Solutions, Inc (KGS) (formerly RDI dNovus) to continue critical operations, technical support, and services on all information technology and network equipment under command and control of ACC's 83d Network Operations Squadron (83 NOS). This requirement is for information technology services and network support for the 83 NOS operations through a wide range of highly specialized technical services for enterprise event management, network assistance, network control and management, network defense operations, network core services management, and associated network operations management support functions. The support services include equipment located at the primary work location in the Integrated Network Operations and Security Center-East enterprise environment at Langley AFB, Hampton VA and at additional work location in the Integrated Network Operations and Security Center-West enterprise environment at Peterson AFB, Colorado Springs CO and Randolph AFB, San Antonio TX. The work also includes maintenance and management of warranty services to sustain, monitor, administer, refresh, and improve support for 83 NOS Enterprise Network Operations. 83 NOS is a conduit between Air Force bases and higher echelons of Air Force Network Operations and the Department of Defense-supporting 650,000 users, and 800,000 systems. KGS currently provides the ITS contract services to keep the network fully operational.
<p>The transition risks to ACC will be mitigated through the sole source award to the incumbent service provider, KGS, to ensure there is no break in service or disruption of operational capability for the required ACC support. The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (iii). A draft sole source justification and approval document is attached to this synopsis. No solicitation document exists. Interested companies may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement via email to Mr. Tay C. Ashford, email: tay.ashford@langley.af.mil, NLT 4:00 P.M. EST on 25 June 09. Alternate POC is Ms. Joy de Lande; email: joy.delande@langley.af.mil. Telephone requests will not be honored. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

In the event such approvals require payment of any fee, the A-E, when so directed by the Contracting Officer, shall pay such fee and obtain a receipt.  The expenditures covering such fees shall constitute a reimbursable item under this contract; and the A-E, upon presentation of a voucher and receipts, shall be reimbursed for the full amount.<BR><BR>1.3	The A-E shall adapt government designs, drawings, specifications and standards for buildings and other structures as necessary to meet the requirements of the approved layout of the proposed project. Prepare detailed designs, specifications, and drawings in required form for buildings and other structures for which government designs are incomplete and unavailable.  All such drawings and specifications will be in effect at the time this task order is duly issued.<BR><BR>1.4	The A-E shall furnish sufficient technical, supervisory and administrative personnel to ensure the expeditious prosecution of the work.<BR><BR>1.5	The A-E shall furnish such advice as may be required to clarify design intent during the bid and construction period.<BR><BR>1.6	The A-E will accept instructions only from the Contracting Officer; however, requests or desires of the Using Agency made directly to the A-E shall be forwarded to the DPW for consideration.<BR><BR>1.7	If at any time during design progress, it should become apparent to the A-E that the construction costs of the project will exceed the construction cost limit set forth in Section 2 of these instructions, he shall immediately notify the DPW.  Cost estimates shall be provided to indicate the estimated cost at the midpoint of construction and additive alternatives shall be provided in the cost and unit price schedule as necessary to ensure a construction bid within the construction cost limit.  It is conceivable that the construction cost and limit of a project can and, in most cases will change between the time this task order is issued and the time that final design is completed.  The A-E will be advised of all changes in the construction cost limit.  A change, or changes, in the construction cost limit shall not categorically constitute a change in scope nor justify any change in the A-E's fee.  The A-E is required to design the project at the full scope at the originally negotiated plus any changes incorporated by contract modification regardless of the fluctuation in the construction cost limit.<BR><BR>1.8	SUBMITTALS: The A-E will prepare and submit for approval the drawings, specifications, cost estimates and other related and supporting documents as are more specifically detailed in Section 2 of these instructions.  A letter of transmittal prepared by the A-E will accompany all submittals of design documents.<BR><BR>1.9	A-E fee proposal will be prepared in detail indicating the various disciplines to be utilized and other associated costs applicable to the work required to accomplish this task order.<BR><BR><BR>SECTION 2 - SCOPE OF WORK<BR><BR><BR>2.1	The work required by this task order will consist of performing all A-E services necessary in the preparation of contract drawings, cost estimates and specifications for DESIGN FOR HVAC UPGRADE FOR B4600, FORT JACKSON, South Carolina.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
DARPA-SN-09-50: Indirect Detection of Special Nuclear Materials at Standoff (SNMS)

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is requesting information on innovative techniques and approaches for the detection of special nuclear material (SNM) at standoff ranges greater than or equal to 5km.

The goal of SNMS is to detect and locate containerized SNM (e.g., plutonium, 235U, enriched isotopes of 235U or 233U) in outdoor environments at standoff distances of greater than or equal to 5km. Ultimately the detection approach should be amenable to support SNM sensor payloads on aircraft and satellites. 

DARPA/STO is not interested in approaches for the detection of primary radiation signatures (e.g., neutrons, gamma rays, alpha and beta particles). Since alpha and beta particles are effectively shielded by containment, innovative concepts and approaches to detect secondary effects associated with neutron and gamma ray emission is of interest. For example, gamma induced ionization of ambient nitrogen emits Ultra-Violet (UV) radiation with the potential for long range detection (cf US patent no 7,317,191 B1). Alternatively, Radiological/Nuclear (RN) sensitive material constructs (composed of naturally occurring or synthetic components) to enhance signal gain, and that may be interrogated remotely, are also worthy of consideration. Under the conditions specified above, detection concepts that exploit passive approaches are anticipated to have greater operational utility.

DARPA/STO is interested in exploring innovative, multidisciplinary approaches and unconventional detection concepts that can lead to SNM detection at long range greater than or equal to 5km) with high accuracy (i.e., a high probability of detection and a low probability of false alarm). The overall time to detect need not necessarily occur in a short timeframe however the integration time for readout should be on the order of minutes (less than or equal to 10 min). The detector concept should be able to address mobile or static SNM sources.

DARPA/STO encourages non-traditional science disciplines to consider how their field of expertise may contribute to a viable approach for the detection of SNM at long range. Non-traditional disciplines include, but are not limited to: photonics, chemistry, acoustics, life sciences, materials sciences, electronics and advanced signal processing.  These can stand on their own or work together with other disciplines to include traditional nuclear physics approaches.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate and award, on a sole source basis, a modification to extend the performance period on contract W912ER-04-D-0004, Task Order 0021, with Fluor Intercontinental, Inc., Greenville, South Carolina. This action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, 'Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.' This action is required to extend operations and maintenance services for the Client Liaison Element (CLE) in Iraq for three months, with a potential three-month additional extension, due to the cancellation of the anticipated Multiple Award Task Order Contract intended to re-compete this service requirement. The current period of performance ends 13 March 2009. Award to any source other than Fluor Intercontinental, Inc would result in unacceptable delays and substantial cost that are considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition. This action will be awarded via a modification to the existing task order. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed towards Fluor Intercontinental, Inc. This notice of intent/synopsis is being issued for information purposes only and it is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation documents are not available. All responses should be directed to Diane R. Bublak at diane.r.bublak@usace.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from publication of this synopsis. No telephone inquires will be accepted.

<DESC><p>This is notice of the Government's intent to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Johnson Controls, Inc; 2505 W Gordon Ave; Albany, GA 31707; under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for an Access Control Security Management System. The Pegasus 2000 Security Management System is a Johnson Controls proprietary software system presently providing security of building 227, 230 and 640 on Robins AFB. Buildings 227 and 230 will connect to the new Software Support Facility, therefore it is more cost effective to procure and install the existing Johnson Controls, Inc system in this facility rather than replacing the entire system in all three facilities to make them compatible.

The Johnson Controls Security Management System will interface with the existing security management system and provide for all the control and monitoring functions required within the facility. This is not a competitive solicitation and quotes are not being requested. Any other responsible source capable of meeting the requirement may submit technical, delivery, pricing, and past performance data sufficient to determine capability. However, the determination to compete or not to compete this requirement is solely at the discretion of the Government.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. <br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). <br />o TIN: ________________________________. <br />o TIN has been applied for. <br />o TIN is not required because: <br />o Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government. <br />(4) Type of organization. <br />o Sole proprietorship; <br />o Partnership; <br />o Corporate entity (not tax-exempt); <br />o Corporate entity (tax-exempt); <br />o Government entity (Federal, State, or local); <br />o Foreign government; <br />o International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4; <br />o Other ________________________________. <br />(5) Common parent. <br />o Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent; <br />o Name and TIN of common parent: <br />Name ________________________________. <br />TIN _________________________________. <br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

By submission of its offer, the offeror represents that it is not an inverted domestic corporation and is not a subsidiary of one.</p>

GOVERNMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION AND EQUIPMENT

1)  In accordance with Chapter 3 of DFAS Regulation 8400.1-R, personally owned workstations, laptop computers, software and printers, including computers connected to the DISP, will not be connected to the DFAS Enterprise Local Area Network (ELAN).  This prohibition is a security requirement to protect the ELAN from the spread of malicious logic (viruses and Trojan Horse programs) and to protect sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information from being compromised.  Contractors performing duties in a DFAS facility may be provided DFAS owned workstations and printers.  If the awarded contract specifies that the contractor is responsible for providing its employees with workstations and printers, these devices must have ELAN connection approval in writing from the Infrastructure Services Organization, Director of Infrastructure Management.  Approval for connection to the ELAN is contingent on the contractor-furnished equipment meeting all stipulations cited in paragraphs C3.3.2.1 through C3.3.2.9 of Chapter 3 of DFAS Regulation 8400.1-R dated November 2003.

2)  The contractor will notify the DFAS LAN support personnel prior to permanently removing any previously connected workstations from DFAS property.  Laptop computers, which are taken home by contractors, will not be erased until the person is permanently removed from the DFAS project or the laptop is being removed from DFAS ELAN service.  The Government personnel will zero the disk drive(s) using Government approved (Ghost 7-pass) software.  This ensures that DFAS licensed software and sensitive but unclassified and privacy act protected information is not removed from Government control. 

3)  Copies of DFAS Regulation 8400.1-R are available from the Government TA

The Period of Performance (POP) will be: October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010.

Basis For Brand Name Requirement:  The parts, materials, and components required for the instant acquisition must be completely compatible with the existing PBX infrastructure in order to support mission operations during the normal operation of the PBX system.  If the Government does not acquire equipment that is completely compatible with the current equipment, the Government may not have operable PBX telecommunication equipment and potentially will not meet the mission essential requirements at DFAS-PE.  NEC certified parts, materials, and components are the only parts that will work in a NEC PBX.  There is currently no other manufacturer of NEC compatible parts that meet the Governments requirements.  NEC  Compatible equipment is only available from NEC Authorized Distributors that is built to the manufactures specifications.  If compatible equipment is not utilized, the PBX equipment would not function properly and would require the Government to replace the entire PBX telecommunication system (which has not met its end of life cycle) in order to maintain mission essential operations.  The estimated cost to replace the PBX system is $100,000.00 to $250,000.00 and a new system would also result in the loss of $325,000.00 already invested in the current system.  Additionally DFAS-PE is scheduled to close under BRAC on 20 Nov 2010 and an investment in a new PBX system is not feasible as the new equipment will not have met its end of life cycle prior to the closure of DFAS-PE. 

Having an unauthorized service provider maintain and service the current Government-Owned equipment may provide a short term financial savings, but these short term savings will put the Government at risk for the failure of the PBX system, and the possibility of extended downtime, which would limit the Governments ability to provide adequate service to our customers.  Service performed by a non-authorized maintenance provider would place the Government in the position of potentially not being able to meet mission essential requirements due to the inoperable PBX telecommunication equipment.  An unauthorized technician does not have access to the required material, parts, and components required to maintain the NEC PBX or NEC technical support experts at NEC.  Whereas, NEC Authorized Technicians have the ability to obtain NEC technical support experts who are capable of solving issues and problems with the PBX system that the NEC Authorized technician can not solve on-site and have immediate access to NEC certified parts, materials, and components required to maintain the NEC PBX system.  This extended technical support offered by NEC Corporation is integral in keeping the PBX system operational and restoring the PBX system in an emergency.  This extended technical support is only available to NEC Authorized Distributors with NEC Certified Technicians.  Additionally if the PBX is not operational, DFAS-PE will not have access to incoming and outgoing calls that are integral to the mission essential requirements of DFAS-PE.

The Government has determined that Only NEC Authorized Distributors with NEC Certified Technicians are capable of supporting and meeting the requirements of the instant acquisition and the instant acquisition shall be processed in as Brand Name basis as detailed above.  Competition shall be requested from NEC Authorized Distributors with NEC Certified Technicians.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541712, is to notify contractors that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking competition of this requirement in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procures.

Under the simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.  This synopsis is designated for 100% Small Business Set Aside competition for a fixed price purchase order.  Prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation.  Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

This combined synopsis solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ).  The FDA intends to award a purchase order to extend the HL7 SPL standard to include the data elements required for food and medical device product facility registration and food and medical device product listing data for processing, reviewing, and archiving by FDA. The Statement of Work is as follows:

I.  Background

FDA is charged with protecting the safety and security of the United States food and drug supply.

On September 28, 2005, Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Homeland Security announced the issuance of the Bioterrorism Act Food Facilities Registration Final Rule.  This rule requires domestic and foreign facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food for consumption in the United States to register with FDA.  The rule implemented the food facilities registration provision of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. 

FDA has been collecting the food facility registration data in a format which is not consistent with the standard utilized to collect other FDA-regulated facility and product data.   The standardization of the format of regulatory data received by the agency will afford an opportunity for FDA to share data amongst its centers and other Federal agencies using one standard and store that data in a single authoritative database which is based on the Health Level Seven (HL7) Reference Information Model (RIM).

II. Objective

In support of the FDA Product Quality Compliance Business Review Boards Harmonized Inventory project, which was approved by the Bioinformatics Board, a health and regulatory data standard to be utilized by industry to generate food facility registration and food product listing information files for submission to FDA is needed. In the spirit of harmonization, the Structured Product Labeling (SPL) standard should also be extended to accommodate medical device product files for submission to FDA. One of the purposes of the Harmonized Inventory project is to create a reliable, complete, up-to-date, master inventory of FDA-related firms, facilities and products, and their associated information.  

As of July 2008, FDA began receiving electronic drug establishment registration and drug listing data.  The HL7 SPL standard is the data standard which permits the capture of content of labeling, drug establishment registration and drug listing data in a format that FDA can process, review, and archive.  The centralized storage of this standardized data, which will include food facility registration and food product data, in the Agencys HL7 RIM-based database permits the tracking of registered facilities which manufacture multiple types of regulated products and the product-component/ingredient data.  Standardization of the data will also assist in the improvement of the accuracy, validation, capturing, and integration of regulatory data as well as the facilitation of design of reporting and analytical tools.

Food facility registration and food and medical device product listing SPL documents submitted to the FDA need to undergo quality control to ensure that the data conform to SPL XML schema and FDA business rules.   A Schematron document will be utilized to validate the data submitted in food facility registration and food and medical device product listing SPL documents to ensure conformance with the SPL schema and FDA business validation procedures.

An implementation guide is needed by the FDA-regulated foods and medical device industry to create SPL files for submission to FDA.  This implementation guide is an HL7 document that is used by industry and SPL software developers who create HL7 SPL messages with food and medical device facility registration and product listing data for submission to FDA.

The foods and medical device product industry and FDA employees will need to view the data in foods SPL documents submitted to FDA.  SPL documents, which are XML documents can be rendered and displayed in hypertext markup (HTML) or XHTML language using an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT).  XSLT is the language that can be utilized to transform XML document into HTML or XHTML documents.  The SPL XSLT stylesheet specifies the default font, indentation, orientation, formatting, word wrapping, line spacing, and other properties that will be used for the display of product information submitted in SPL format.

III. Scope

Very good in all respects.  Advantages/strengths not offset by disadvantages/weaknesses.  Very good probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Government requirements.  <BR>Good<BR>Proposal meets most solicitation requirements and demonstrates a good understanding of the requirements but does not offer significant advantages to the Government over basic RFP requirements.  Disadvantages/weaknesses are not significant, unless significant advantages are proposed that outweigh significant disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications, given by contractor, were acceptable.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government requirements.   <BR>Satisfactory<BR>Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements, but offers disadvantages (weaknesses) outweighing other advantages (strengths).  Examples may include little or no experience cited; weak proposal; mimics RFP language rather than expressing offerors approach or understanding of the RFP.  Probability of success considered less than full confidence.<BR>Marginal<BR>Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements.  Examples:  Proposal does not address all required RFP criteria; little or no experience to the extent that Overall quality cannot be determined because of errors, omissions or deficiencies that may be capable of being corrected without a major rewrite or revision of proposal.  Probability of success is questionable without further explanation by offeror.  <BR>Unsatisfactory<BR>Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations.  Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies.<BR><BR>The following rating will be used for Past Performance Rating<BR>Risk rating<BR>Description of risk rating<BR>Very Low Risk<BR>Very high quality past performance.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was generally current and very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Governments requirements.  <BR>Low Risk<BR>Good quality past performance.  Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective actions to resolve where appropriate.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Average Risk<BR>Adequate quality of past performance.  Problems may have been identified and the contractor usually took adequate corrective action.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Although performance exceeds expectations and was rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were generally semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation.  Fair probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Above Average Risk<BR>Rather poor quality of past performance. Problems may have been identified and contractor occasionally took corrective action, but not always to the owners satisfaction.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an overall above average risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>High Risk<BR>Unacceptable quality of past performance. There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature.  Contractors corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective.  Performance was current and very relevant to semi-relevant.  Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>Neutral<BR>No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Government personnel were unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors.  This is neither a negative nor a positive assessment.  <BR><BR>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award(s) without discussions with offerors (except for needed clarifications as per FAR 15.306(a).  Therefore, your initial proposal should contain your best terms, as it pertains to cost/pricing.  Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss, or revise your original proposal.

<DESC>Solicitation Number:  NHLBI-PB(HG)-2009-218 
Title: RECOVERY  Illumina, Inc., Brand Laboratory Instruments & Reagents and Covaris, Inc., Brand Laboratory Instruments

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The solicitation number is NHLBI-PB(HG)-2009-218 and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). 

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33. 

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13  Simplified Acquisition Procedures,  Subpart 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and FAR Part 12Acquisition of Commercial Items.  

There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement.

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 334516  Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, with a size standard of 500 employees.

Market research conducted by the Government through the issuance of a sources sought small business synopsis posted in the FedBizOpps on June 26, 2009, has determined that there is no reasonable expectation of receiving two (2) or more offers from small business third-party resellers that are capable of providing the equipment listed herein of a large business manufacturer.  Therefore, the acquisition is being conducted on an unrestricted basis with no set-aside restrictions. 

This requirement is for the acquisition of brand name only laboratory instruments and reagents manufactured by Illumina, Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, CA 92121-1975, a large business and laboratory instruments manufactured by Covaris, Inc., 14 Gill Street, Unit H, Woburn, MA, a small business.   

The Governments minimum requirements for the Illumina and Covaris instruments are: (1) Integrated system that is capable of both array-based assays and next-generation sequencing; (2) Compatibility with existing equipment; (3) Cost effective when compared to stand-alone next-generation sequencing equipment; (4) Generation of large amounts of high quality sequencing data; (5) Variety of applications possible; and (6) Flexibility of sample sizes within a run.

These minimum requirements are necessary for the laboratorys ability to continue array-based genotyping while adding the ability to do next-generation sequencing for the follow-up of genomic regions of interest detected via array-based genome-wide association studies. 

The Illumina brand instruments and reagents, and the Covaris brand instruments were selected for this requirement because their instruments met the Governments minimum requirements.  An example of how the instruments met the Governments minimum requirements such as the special features of the Illumina iScan Sequencing Module and Cluster Station: 300Mb of data per day, up to 3Gb per flow cell, Range of read lengths possible (25bp  2x50bp), Multiple applications from a single system: small genome sequencing, targeted re-sequencing, ChIP-SEQ, mRNA-SEQ, small RNA sequencing, Paired-end and single read capable, Ability to multiplex 1-12 samples per lane (8-96 samples per flow cell), Integration of array-based assays and next-generation sequencing into one platform, and compatibility with an existing iScan which will reduced hardware cost versus a stand-alone next-generation sequencing only instrument.  

These features are not provided by comparable items from the other firms researched. The other companies similar products, lacked the particular features, do not meet, and cannot be modified to meet, the Governments minimum requirements.  Therefore, because only the Illumina and Covaris instruments  can satisfy this requirement.

<DESC>NIH is in the process of evaluating its human research protection program (HRPP) using standards established by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs (AAHRPP). This organization is the recognized world leader in evaluating and accrediting HRPPs. NIHs goal is to obtain full accreditation from AAHRPP by 2010.

Achieving this goal requires an evaluation of current human subjects protection policies and practices to determine if NIH policies meet accreditation standards, if modifications are needed, or, if additional policies must be created.  The policies include standard operating procedures for the NIH IRBs, the NIH Manual Chapter for the NIH HRPP, MAS policies, OHSR Information sheets, memos, delegations of authority, and possibly the Intramural Research Program Conflict of Interest policy (COI).  This evaluation will be used for the accreditation process, as well as administrative management assessment of the HRPP. 

This evaluation process is a trans-NIH initiative involving the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research (OHSR); NIH institutes and centers with clinical programs (Clinical Directors, Principal Investigators) to include the: Deputy Director for Intramural Research, Human Subjects Research Advisory Committee, the 12 NIH IRBs, the Clinical Center, Medical Executive Board, as well as committees established specifically for the purpose of AAHRPP accreditation activities. All of these organizational units/scientists are stakeholders in the evaluation process. 

NIH requires expertise and additional personnel support in this work. The final product of this evaluation will be an NIH application for AAHRPP accreditation that clearly states the policies and procedures of the NIH for human subjects research and meets the standards set by AAHRPP for accreditation. This work product will include any new policies and procedures that are developed during the evaluation. An additional work product will be findings and recommendations for strategic management planning for the NIH HRPP.

The most significant deliverable will be an NIH Application for AAHRPP Accreditation, consistent with regulatory requirements, NIH policies, and AAHRP standards.  However this work involves significant evaluation activities in order to prepare such an application.  The evaluation will collect and analyze data from document reviews of policies and procedures of the HRPP, IRBs, OHSR, the ICs clinical programs, Medical Administrative Service (MAS), and the Medical Executive Committee (MEC).  OHSR will work with the various units to modify current policies and procedures or establish new policies and procedures to obtain accreditation and maintain the high standards of the NIH HRPP. All work under this SOW will be monitored by the Project Officer.

The Office of Human Subject Research (OHSR) NIH proposes to select a vendor in accordance with the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12.

The Request for Quotation (RFQ) (N55236-09-Q-8053) is issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336611. The small business standard is 1000 employees. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-34 (Effective on July 1, 2009). DESCRIPTION: The requirement is for a firm-fixed-price (FFP) type purchase order; Contract Line Item No. (CLIN) 0001 is to provide three (3) Naval Port Operations Utility Boat refurbishments.

Period of performance: 08/12/2009 through 11/30/2009. Refer to Attachment (1) for the entire statement of work. Work to be accomplished at contractor's facility. Offeror shall provide the facility name, street address, city, state, and zip code where the work is to be accomplished, with their quote. PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Packaging and preservation shall be performed in accordance with the best commercial practices to afford maximum protection against damage. DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: Items shall be priced at F.O.B. Destination and shall be delivered in accordance with the attached statement of work. Offerors shall include in their quote the cost of transportation of the boats. Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination by the Government. 52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) past performance and (ii) price. Past performance when compared to price is approximately equal in importance. (b) Options (not applicable). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The total evaluated price will be the sum of CLINs 0001-0002.  CLIN 0001 shall price the refurbishment of Whaler-15 in accordance with the Attachment A - Statement of Work.  CLIN 0002 shall price the refurbishment of OR-5 and Whaler-14 in accordance with the Attachment A - Statement of Work. The Government will evaluate the proposed price for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.305 (a)(1) and FAR Subpart 15.4. The Government will also determine the realism and balance of each price by comparing it to other proposed prices and the independent government estimate. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror has satisfied customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Offeror's past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the following subfactors (of past performance) which are of equal importance: 1. Technical (Quality of Product) - expected performance of the technical requirements of the subject availability based upon an offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 2. Schedule - expected performance in meeting the schedule requirements of the subject availability based upon a offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness if any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 3. Management - the expected performance in managing the subject availability based upon an offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. This includes an evaluation of the offeror's past performance in complying with the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. The Government's evaluation of your past performance will be subjective, and based mainly on performance evaluations available in the automated Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), information obtained from your references during telephone interviews and/or performance questionnaires, and information available in the Government's local files to evaluate past performance. The Government may use other sources, as appropriate. The Government will consider performance of work that you have subcontracted to another firm as your past performance. However, the Government will not consider the past performance of a proposed subcontractor, unless that performance was under a subcontract awarded by you. The Government will give greater consideration to contracts requiring the same or similar type and complexity of work required by the RFQ. However, other types of contracts/work may be considered as part of the past performance evaluation as well, if aspects of the past performance are deemed to have some bearing on the expected performance of the subject solicitation. Prepare and submit one Reference Information Sheet for each of the contracts that you would like the Government to consider when evaluating your past performance in the format of Attachment (2). The contracts that you reference must be ongoing or have been completed within the last three years. On the Reference Information Sheet, include the names of references who can verify that you have done the type of work that is required under the contract contemplated by this RFQ and who will provide information about the quality of your past performance. However, the Government may not contact all of your references. If a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) has been completed for one or more of the contracts that you would like to reference, you need not submit a Reference Information Sheet for those contracts. Instead, you may provide a list of such contracts. Make sure that your reference information is up to date and that each reference will cooperate with us. Do not give us the names of a reference unless you have made sure that we can reach that reference at the telephone number, e-mail address, and postal address that you have provided, and that they will give us the information that we want. Offerors shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. Quotes shall state the unit prices and total prices of the items required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: Quotes received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will make an offeror ineligible for award. The FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process to satisfy FAR 52.212-3. More information on ORCA is found at https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is  09-233-SOL-00122 , and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 .   This requirement is solicited under Full and Open Competition.  This acquisition is being conducted using Part 12 and Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. A Time and Material contract is anticipated. It is the intent of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) to acquire services in support of collecting best practices associated with models of both medical countermeasures distribution and enhancing community resilience in the face of disasters by conducting a wide ranging and comprehensive literature review and synthesis of articles that describe these best practices. The initial challenge for policy-makers and public health officials has been identifying these best practices and countermeasures, evaluating their potential effectiveness; and determining whether they can be replicated.  Homeland Security Presidential Directive 21 (HSPD-21) states:
The four most critical components of public health and medical preparedness are biosurveillance, countermeasure distribution, mass casualty care, and community resilience. 
The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in coordination with Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop templates, using a variety of tools and including private sector resources when necessary, that provide minimum operational plans to enable communities to distribute and dispense countermeasures to their populations within 48 hours after a decision to do so.
Where local civic leaders, citizens and families are educated regarding threats and are empowered to mitigate their own risk, where they are practiced in responding to events, where they have social networks to fall back upon, and where they have familiarity with local public health and medical systems, there will be community resilience that will significantly attenuate the requirement for  additional assistance
The initial challenge for policy-makers and public health officials has been identifying best practices associated with countermeasures distribution and community resiliency; evaluating their potential effectiveness; and determining whether they can be replicated.
Because ASPR is responsible for coordinating and directing the Departments public health and medical emergency preparedness and response programs, as well as for ensuring the sustained public health and medical readiness for our communities and our nation against bioterrorism, infectious disease outbreaks, and other public health threats and emergencies, they have researched this area of need and determined that there is no comprehensive , systematic, review, or synthesis of such academic research material. 

To further support ASPR/OPEO policy and development of templates called for in HSPD-21,The Division of National Healthcare Preparedness Programs (NHPP), Hospital Preparedness Programs (HPP) proposes to identify, categorize and evaluate the literature surrounding the best practices associated with models of medical countermeasures distribution enhancing community resilience in the face of disasters.  For the purposes of this proposed project, ASPR/ NHPP requests services to identify, categorize and evaluate the relevant literature.  An innovative methodology is needed that will allow the synthesis of available literature and evaluate the potential effectiveness and replicate models of best practices.

Information regarding WAWF is available on the internet at https://wawf.eb.mil/. <br />(End of Addenda)<br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), ATTN: Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, United States Coast Guard, 2100 2nd St SW STOP 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112; FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: 
Commandant (CG-851) 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606 Washington, D. C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

Background

United States Coast Guard (USCG) vessels require updated electronic charts in ELECTRONIC NAUTICAL CHARTS (ENC) and RASTER NAUTICAL CHARTS (RNC) format for their areas of operation, which includes U.S., Canadian, Latin American, and Caribbean waters.  Most electronic navigational charts for the U.S. waters are available from the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Association, National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) or the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  Charts for non-U.S. waters will need to be acquired from and produced on the authority of various International Hydrographic Offices.  To support this requirement, the Coast Guard is seeking a contract for the continued monthly distribution updates for charts for these geographic areas, delivered on CD-ROM at set intervals and times, to USCG vessels for use with their navigation systems.  The Coast Guards goal is to ensure that USCG vessels are provided with the most current and up-to-date electronic navigational charts available. By utilizing the services of a commercial contractor who is familiar with both International and United States electronic charting standards, the Coast Guard believes it can more effectively and efficiently provide updated navigational charts to USCG vessels and overcome inconsistencies that can occur from the constant changing of personnel and the broad range of computer skills.

<DESC><p>This is an amendment to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation (Combo) posted on 9 July 09 for solicitation # F2EMMT9118AQ01. There will be no change to the response date of 17 July 2009 16:00 PM MST.
<p>DESCRIPTION: <br />CLIN 0001 - Repair-includes the following: Disassemble, test, clean, and inspect all parts. Recondition stator and rotor-varnish treat, assemble using 1 each new bearing.</p>
<p>CLIN 0002 - Dynamic Balance.</p>
<p>ADD CLIN 0003 - Freight</p>
<p>Purpose: The Marathon Alternator is a high voltage 3 phase 4160 V generator coupled with a V-12 Cummins diesel engine. The purpose of this Form 9 is to provide detailed electrical disassembly, cleaning, testing, inspection, stator/rotor reconditioning and single bearing replacement. Also, requested is baking, which is a method used to dry all winding inside unit to avoid any possible damage due to wetness from cleaning. This task is required to ensure proper high voltage output for the MEP-12 generator. Generator is currently in Non-Mission Capable (NMC) status.</p>
<p>Impact to Mission if not funded: Without this major step accomplished, the $165k generator will have to be turned in for disposition. Also, with the lack of prime power generator sets in the AF inventory, this will cause a major setback in missions requiring power plant demands. Also, unit will remain in NMC status affecting SORTS reporting status. Once the service is completed on the unit and the Squadron personnel complete a functional check, the generator will be able to be reported as Full Mission Capable (FMC) in SORTS.</p>

<DESC>Question that had been asked to NRCS in regards to the cost of title insurance, please see question asked and answer below:

QUESTION:  In Part I-The Schedule, Section B, USDA is asking my company to supply a Quote for Title Insurance Premium for $1000 Value.  What does this $1000 Value relate too?  Is this asking for $1000 per easement or some other figure such as the purchase price?  If it is another number, could you provide a range of purchase prices in the past?  

ANSWER:  The question is asking for a cost of title insurance per $1,000 value of the easement. 
Example: What is the cost of title insurance where the government has acquired an easement for $500,000? This needs to be expressed in cost/1000 dollars

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<CONTACT>Nathan Johnson, Email nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC><p>&nbsp;This is a solicitation notice for the following statement of work (see attached for full solicitation).</p>
<p>This will be a firm fixed price contract for tree surveying services in Islip, New York.</p>
<p>There are approximately 68,000 trees to be inspected. These inspections must be completed within one year from date of contract award. There are enough Government personnel to accompany up to two teams of seven (8) workers each (sixteen (16) total). This number excludes the Foreman. Approximately 70% of these trees are on properties with many trees grouped closely together. We refer to these groups of trees as "stands". These stand properties are in both the Level 1 Quarantine area and the Level 2 Quarantine area. The list of properties with stands will be provided by Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) personnel. On these type of properties, the contract climbers will be responsible for inspecting all host trees - climbing all climbable host trees and visually inspecting the remaining non-climbable trees with binoculars, when appropriate. The contract climbers will be responsible for recording these inspections on the survey forms provided by ALB staff. The contract climbers will provide the survey forms capturing individual tree records as well as a summary of trees by Genus to ALB staff at the end of each working day. ALB staff will establish a presence during the inspections of these properties, as deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>The remaining 30% of the trees are scattered throughout residential areas, on private properties in the Level 2 Quarantine area. On these types of properties, the contract climbers will typically be responsible for inspecting only the climbable trees. ALB personnel will accompany the contract climbers to these properties and inspect the non-climbable trees. In the rare event that ALB program staff cannot accompany the contractor (e.g., unanticipated emergency with no replacement personnel) it may be necessary for the contract climbers to inspect all trees on a residential property and collect all pertinent data.</p>
<p>In general, work shall proceed on a block-by-block basis, working in teams led by ALB Program tree climbers and inspectors inspecting ALB host species for evidence of infestation. The survey (inspection of trees) shall include trees located along streets, boulevards, backyards, parklands, railroads, industrial parks, cemeteries, etc. The majority of the climbing survey shall include trees in dense, heavily wooded lots and properties. The bucket truck inspections shall include trees deemed by the ALB staff or contractor staff with the concurrence of ALB climbers, inspectors to be unsafe to climb due to various reasons such as power lines and poor tree health. The contractor shall inspect all host trees in the designated areas searching for ALB damage and active infestations.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT BOILER PLANT DEFICIENCIESSTATEMENT OF WORKENGINEER AND DESIGNCorrection of Safety and Reliability DeficienciesBoilers and Boiler Plant Auxiliary EquipmentVAMC Clarksburg, WVMay 2009Cost Range IAW FAR 36.204, defining the magnitude of the construction project as between $250,000.00 - $500,000.00.General Requirements:Provide a design via engineering principles for work on burners and control systems must be performed by a skilled boiler/burner controls service technician during a construction project.  The design will incorporate all the items below.  Vendor will be responsible for field verifying all information.Upon completion of the design the vendor will provide the VA all required bid documents required for the proper advertisement of a construction project.  Upon completion of each item, test operation and provide data sheet showing test results including set point and operating point.All testing procedures must comply with VHA Boiler Plant Safety Device Testing Manual, 3rd Edition. Boilers:1.    For Boilers #1 & 2: The high pressure gas fuel cutoff switches (HPFCS) are not located properly. They are now located downstream of the fuel flow control valve where the gas pressure varies when the burner firing rate varies. The proper location is between the gas pressure regulator and the flow control valve, where the pressure is constant. This will protect against a regulator failure at all firing rates.a.	Relocate the switches as shown on attached Burner Gas Piping Schematic Diagram. Connections between switches and gas piping must have lockable valves and valved test ports.b.	Adjust set points to 120% of regulated gas pressure.c.	If there are nuisance burner trips due to inaccurate gas pressure regulation, the pressure regulators must be repaired or replaced to provide the required accurate pressure control. This will make the burner operation more efficient at low loads and allow proper setting of the pressure switch for maximum safety.d.	Test switch and interlock operation.2.    For Boilers #1 & 2: The proof of closure switches (POC) on the automatic oil fuel safety shut off valves open at about 60% of valve stroke. The POC switches are "valve seal overtravel" switches and it is apparent that the valves are not properly adjusted when the POC are still made at 60% of valve stroke. It is likely that the valves are flowing oil when the POC switches are made.a.	Repair or replace valves. Valve repair must conform to the requirements of the valve manufacturer.b.	Test valves for seat leakage and for proper operation of the POC switches.3.    For Boilers #1 & 2: The pre-purge airflow proving switches are not plumbed correctly.a.	Replumb the pressure sensing lines to measure pressure differential between the forced draft fan discharges (after any dampers) and the boiler outlets, before the economizers.b.	Adjust the switches to "make" at 80% of the maximum pressure differential at high fire.c.	Test the switch and interlock operation.4.       For Boilers #1, 2 & 3: The existing forced draft fan motor interlocks not sufficient to prove     the forced draft fans are actually running.a.	Install "Symcom Model 777" or "Veris Industries Hawkeye 300" forced draft fan motor interlocks that monitor current flow on each power leg and loss of a phase. Connect to burner management control interlock circuits. These devices have provisions for testing the interlock.b.	Test interlock operation5.       For Boilers #1 & 2: On each boiler provide low flue gas oxygen interlocks in the burner management control circuits that will automatically shut down the burners if the flue gas oxygen falls below a safe level.a.     For Boilers #1 & 2:Utilize the existing flue gas oxygen analyzers to provide the low   oxygen signals.b.     For Boilers #1, 2 & 3: The existing flue gas oxygen analyzers are reported to be not    functioning properly. They must be placed in satisfactory operation by a trained technician.c.      For Boilers #1 & 2:Adjust the set points of the interlocks to approximately 0.5% oxygen above the point where the flue gas CO starts to climb above 200 ppm. 6.     For Boilers #1, 2 & 3: Provide alarm and burner interlock for control air pressure failure. Control air operates the boiler feedwater flow control valves. As an option, the feedwater control valves could be converted to electric operation.a.	Locate pressure switches downstream of the air pressure regulators serving the boiler feedwater flow control valves.b.	Provide two switches for each boiler. One switch set at 20 psi above the minimum allowable operating air pressure as an alarm, and a second switch set at 10 psi above the minimum allowable operating air pressure as a burner interlock.c.	V. A. Specification for pressure switches:Mercury switch, graduated set point indicator, switch position indicator, adjustable set point coordinated with burner requirements, automatic reset, UL listed.Pressure Rating: Shall exceed maximum relief pressure of nearest upstream relief valve.d.	Connect air pressure switches to burner management interlock and alarm circuits.e.	Adjust set point of switches.f.	Test switch alarm and interlock operation.9.      For Boilers #1, 2 & 3: Drill and pin all combustion control system lever arms and linkages to prevent slippages. Boiler No. 1 (Work limited to Boiler No. 1):1.      The combustion air pressure switch (CAPS) is not plumbed for testing.a.	Add lockable valves and test ports as shown in the attached Combustion Air Switch  Piping Diagram.b.	Set the switch at 80% of the minimum differential air pressure.c.	Test the switch and interlock operation.Boiler No. 2 (Work limited to Boiler No. 2):1.      The combustion air pressure switch (CAPS) is not plumbed for testing.a.	Add lockable valves and test ports as shown in the attached Combustion Air Switch  Piping Diagram.b.	Set the switch at 80% of the minimum differential air pressure.c.	Test the switch and interlock operation.Plant Support Equipment:1.        Install high water alarm switch for the condensate storage tank. The high level alarm switch should be a conductivity probe type switch located at 2/3 of the tank height.

<DESC>Amendment 01:  The purpose of this amendment is to change the relative order of importance of the evaluation factors and to revise the proposal due date.  All changes are highlighted in yellow in the attached conformed full BAA document.

Original Synopsis Below.

DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&amp;D) proposals in the area of cavity-optomechanics.  While mechanical properties of light have long been understood, the idea that light can be used to effectively damp the motion of a macroscopic object is quite new.  The ORCHID program is focused on exploiting optomechanical interactions between high-Q optical cavities coupled with high-Q mechanical resonators to damp or amplify the motion of macroscopic mechanical devices.  In this context, damping does not lower the bulk temperature of a device; instead it affects only a few of the device's vibrational modes. However, it is these same vibrational modes that can perform transduction in mechanical sensors. As a result, this type of damping can be used to control (in situ) the dynamic range and bandwidths of mechanical sensors and to remove constraints imposed by thermal noise.  When optomechanical damping (cooling) is strong enough to remove phonons from the relevant modes, the quantum mechanical properties of the device are expected to become manifest, enabling entirely new sensing and signal processing functionality.  By contrast, when phonon energy is transferred from the optical cavity to the mechanical oscillator, its motion can be amplified. Thus, another aspect of the ORCHID program focuses on the development of high frequency regenerative optomechanical oscillators. These oscillators are expected to exhibit reduced linewidth and phase noise.  They will be unique in the world of oscillators, as they will feature purely optical input and output for both power and signal.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  (electronic mail: DARPA-BAA-09-26@darpa.mil, fax: 703-496-2069, DARPA/MTO.)   See the full BAA document attached.</p>

<DESC>REVISION 1:  The purpose of this revision is to extend the request for information (RFI) closing date from 7/10/2009 to 7/17/2009.  This action is necessitated as a result of several inquiries received from industry as a result of the initial posting.  It is anticipated that responses to the questions and concerns will be posted to the FAA Contract Opportunities (FAACO) Website no later than close of business (3:00 P.M. EST) on 7/13/2009.
Due to the time sensitiveness associated with this action, no further questions will be entertained at this time.
End of Revision 1:

This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information.  This announcement IS NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) of any kind.  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
All interested parties are advised that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI).  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.
Previous market surveys have solicited responses pertaining to specific switch technologies and applications.  The FAA is now pursuing an end-to-end system approach to upgrade the aging National Airspace System (NAS) voice communications infrastructure in order to satisfy NextGen initiatives that require a networked infrastructure to support dynamic asset reallocation.  The NAS voice communications system consists of voice switching functions, radio control functions, and a telecommunications medium.
The upgrade will require a system with proven technology that ensures availability in both high traffic volume and emergency situations while maintaining current voice quality and latency standards.  The purpose of this Market Survey/RFI is:  to solicit information related to improving the Government's understanding of the current voice communications marketplace, to obtain information on available technology and innovative approaches that may fulfill its mission, and to gain insight into industry capabilities and best practices in regards to a voice system that provides flexibility for the NAS.  Vendors are welcome to invite the FAA to view demonstrations of any aspect of their representative solutions.  The FAA is contemplating a Contract Award date in FY11.
Attachment A provides background information on the current NAS voice communications system, concepts and ideas being studied by our European counterparts as well standards development by International bodies in support of Air Traffic Management communications to help gain insight into issues impacting its performance and long term supportability.  
Attachment B is the vendor response template.  Interested vendors are requested to provide full and complete responses to the items in Attachment B.  Special emphasis is being placed on identifying innovative communications solutions that will improve the quality of the FAA's Investment Analysis efforts and the forthcoming acquisition of a new state of the art voice communications system.
Respondents to the Market Survey/Request for Information may be requested to provide additional information at the option of the Government. No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise for future business with the FAA.  Information obtained from Attachment B will be used to support the development of an acquisition strategy for a national program supporting all NAS voice communications; to refine the Government's NVS business case; and resolve system issues to support a business decision. Respondents who have additional material to add to previous inquiries are invited to provide supplemental responses.  
All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 50 pages.  No type font less than 12-point may be used.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  If there are questions, please submit them to the FAA Contracting Office, Ken Carter, via e-mail at Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov and via telephone at 202-267-3012.  Responses to this RFI must be submitted by 3:00 p.m. on July 10 2009 but are welcome before the due date as well.
The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following email address: Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov.  Please submit in a portable document format (PDF), however, Microsoft Word is acceptable.  If you cannot respond electronically, please send to:
Federal Aviation AdministrationATTN: Mr. Ken Carter, AJA-47800 Independence Avenue, SWWashington, D.C. 20591



ATTACHMENT ADESCRIPTION OF MISSION NEED  

There is an increasing need for flexible voice communication capabilities in support of both current and future demands on the FAA's NAS.  New capabilities must overcome the inflexibility of current NAS voice communications by allowing better access to voice communication assets, load-sharing and load balancing across facilities, and dynamicallyreconfiguring sectors/facilities to support Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Business Continuity Planning.  The future of the NAS requires the migration toward a networked voice communications system.
The NAS voice communications system consists of voice switching functions, radio control functions and a telecommunications medium that supports Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities with as few as 4 positions to over 800 positions.  The scope of such a system creates several technical challenges.  To meet mission requirements, the FAA must field a voice system with proven technology that ensures availability in both high traffic volume and emergency situations, while maintaining or improving current voice quality levels and latency standards.  
The following documents are included in this RFI as reference:
- NextGen CONOPS (see http://www.jpdo.gov/library/NextGen_v2.0.pdf )- Presentation on European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) Working Group (WG) 67 EUROCAE Documents (EDs) 136-139.- NAS Voice Communications Proposed Functional Architecture and Definitions- Previous Market Survey Solicitations are available upon request
The following may be used for a more complete understanding of current NAS planning:NAS Architecture 6.0 - http://nas-architecture.faa.gov/nas/NextGen - http://www.jpdo.gov/	      
ATTACHMENT BMARKET SURVEY/REQUEST FOR INFORMATIONRESPONSE TEMPLATE

Respondents are requested to provide a white paper response identifying innovative approaches to the voice communications requirements in Attachment A.   The response must:
1.	Include an Executive Summary (no more than one page).
2.   Provide analyses and information in response to the following:
Voice Communication System1) Please identify the differences between your representative or deployed voice communications system and the attached Reference Architecture. Please provide information of any deployed location(s), system architecture, technology, communication protocols, scalability, etc. 
Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)/Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Considerations2) Assuming the FAA uses TDM, VoIP, or a hybrid of the two for the telecommunications medium, please describe the interfaces (e.g. E1/T1, 4 wire E&M, VoIP, etc.) supported by your representative voice communications system. 
3) For your representative voice communications system architecture (Air-to-Ground/Ground-to-Ground), please propose a latency budget, for each ATM component in milliseconds. (e.g. European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) Working Group (WG) 67 EUROCAE Document (ED) 136)  Please clarify your response with and without security considerations and also state your assumptions around the security parameters you would recommend.
4) Given the proposed Reference Architecture, would you consider TDM or IP a more optimal transportation medium to Air/Ground communication sites and other NAS facilities?
5) Given your representative protocol, please explain how you would transport the multiple PTT and main/standby select signals. 
6) If your representative voice communications system utilizes VoIP, what would you allocate for bandwidth to satisfy the communication needs for a 4-position facility?  What would be the allocation for an 800-position facility?  Please describe specifically how you plan to deal with Capacity and sizing, number of packets per second,  as well as throughput timing delay and performance.  Please also provide the analysis of the aggregate bandwidth in terms of traffic and its rate of flow while accounting for security parameters.  
7) If your representative voice communications system utilizes VoIP, what Interoperability Standards (e.g. European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) Working Group (WG) 67 EUROCAE Document (ED) 137) were used for VoIP ATM components (e.g. Radios, Radio Control Equipment, Voice Recording Equipment)?
8) If your representative voice communications system utilizes VoIP, what qualification tests for VoIP ATM components and systems are being used (e.g. EUROCAE WG67 ED 139)?  NVS Management System (NMS)9) Please provide a description of the network management system functions and capabilities supporting your representative voice communications system.
10) How many network management nodes would you recommend in an optimal network?  
11) Will the network status, monitoring and reporting system impact thenetwork performance, if so how? 
12) Will the network management system capability be centralized ordistributed? 
13) What type of network database design approach will be used for the NVS? 
14) How would you integrate the NMS with the various elements of the NVS?  Please focus your answer on the actual interfaces between each element and how the elements would "talk" to each other. 
Transition15) How would you meet the NextGen initiative during a transition (10 years or more) which continues legacy operations while introducing network equipment and capabilities (this includes replacing/modifying existing FAA switches, networks, and remote radio control units with your representative voice communications system)?
Radio Control Equipment (RCE)16) Have you emulated RCE in voice switch and/or remote site equipment?  
17) Presently, FAA Remote Communication Air Ground (RCAG) facilities' equipment racks accommodate 2U (3.5") of rack space for radio control equipment.  Considering this 2U constraint, what is the size of your representative remote radio control unit (for 1 channel/2 frequencies) including thermal (venting) requirements? Reconfiguration18) What is the approach and how fast can your representative voice communications system reconfigure for one hundred Air-to-Ground channels to be up and operational at a back up site if there is a major disaster at an adjacent site? What are the limitations on reconfiguration as the number of channels increases over 100?  
Security19) What are the security risks and proposed mitigations, assuming a private, managed network?  Consider the scenario where an unauthorized individual obtains physical access to a remote radio site; please specifically address the threat of a compromise to the voice communications system.  Please document any assumptions upon which you have based your answer. 
20) If your representative voice communications system utilizes VoIP, what Network Requirements (e.g. EUROCAE WG67 ED 138) were used to meet the needs of VoIP network services for ATM applications (e.g. Network Specifications/Domains, Security Architecture, IP Addressing Schemes)?
Remote Maintenance Monitoring (RMM)21) Does your representative voice communications system support remote maintenance and monitoring? Please describe the system's RMM functions and high level design. 
Lifecycle Support22) Would your company consider a Build-Operate-Transfer Public/Private partnership located at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City, OK for depot level maintenance on your representative voice communications system?
23) How would you recommend providing on-site controller training on your representative voice communications system including switch partitioning and separate switches? Please address the risks involved with each approach.  
General24) What tradeoffs should be explored in a system approach to the NAS voice communications system?

GLP Regulations are available on the World Wide Web (WWW) at www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/bimo/glp/87finalrule.htm and GLP Regulations Questions and Answers are available at www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/old004fn.pdf. Compliance is documented in a FDA inspection report. A copy of the two most recent FDA GLP inspection reports must be included in the proposal. If only one (1) report exists, it is acceptable to include only that one (1) report. In addition, one other mandatory qualification criterion which must be met at the time of receipt of Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) is that the Contractor's animal facilities must be accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International as indicated by providing the latest accreditation report.

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984 (Title III of Pubic Law 98-623, 16 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.) provides the legislative authority necessary to implement, with respect to the United States, the Antarctic Living Marine Resources (AMLR) program. The AMLR program, which is managed by the Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division (AERD) at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), provides information to the U.S. delegation to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), part of the Antarctic treaty system.</p>
<p>CCAMLR is an international treaty that seeks to manage Antarctic fisheries with the goal of preserving species diversity and stability of the entire Antarctic marine ecosystem. In keeping with this objective, CCAMLR has designated areas of research that member nations are obligated to pursue. The AMLR Program has identified specific datasets that must be collected to respond to CCAMLR's research directives. In doing so, the AMLR Program supports the U.S. Government's commitment to CCAMLR.</p>
<p>Each austral season, the AMLR Program conducts two research cruise legs in the study area. Within the study area, the Program has defined a large-area survey grid of approximately 108 stations around Elephant, Clarence, King George, and Livingston Islands, which will be occupied once on each cruise leg. In addition, station transects across hydrographic features, directed net sampling, fine-scale acoustic surveys, and other specialized studies are conducted. In some years, a single "krill" leg and a "fish" leg is conducted. In all other years, two "krill" legs are conducted.</p>
<p>A critical component of the shipboard operations is the collection and archiving of data used to describe the physical environment. These data include 1) continuous observations of sea surface and meteorological conditions, and 2) vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, light transmission, and other parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The overall purpose of this contract is to provide meteorological and oceanographic data, which will be used to describe frontal zones, water mass structure and surface currents near Antarctic Peninsula. This information will in turn be used to study the physical causes of variations in biological production in the area. These studies ultimately lead to the formulation of management advice and options in support of U.S. obligations to CCAMLR.</p>
<p>Specific objectives are: 1) Set up and maintain the instruments, connections and data logging equipment; 2) Collect and archive underway and station data; 3) Provide QA/QC of all physical data; 4) Prepare a report summarizing activities and data collected; and 5) Provide general electronic technician support to other shipboard research components.</p>
<p>The data will be collected during the course of approximately a 62-day cruise, beginning and ending in Punta Arenas, Chile (cruise times and dates are decided each cruise year and are not definite or the same from one cruise year to the next). In addition, there will be a 3-day import prior to the beginning of the cruise and a 2-day mid-cruise port call. 24-hour per day operations will be conducted during portions of the cruise and it is expected that at least two sea-going people will be required to accomplish the tasks listed below. In addition, the contractor shall be responsible for providing transportation to and from Punta Arenas.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall set up, test and maintain two complete data collection systems. The first consists of an underway data logging system using a Windows-based program called "Shipboard Computer System", a serial port multiplexer and various sensors. The sensors include a Pacific Environmental Systems WeatherPak, a SeaBird 21 thermosalinograph, and digitized inputs from the ship's gyrocompass and GPS. Additional sensors may include a flow-through transmissometer, a light meter, and a fluorometer. The second system consists of a SeaBird 911+ CTD with bottle carousel, oxygen sensor and altimeter; additional instruments could include transmissometers, fluorometers and light meters. Water samples would be taken from 7-10 depths but no analysis will be conducted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall collect underway data whenever the ship is underway: during transits to and from port, during survey operations, during calibration activities and while servicing shore camps. Data products will include real time displays of selected variables, time averaged data logs indexed by position, date and time, and a report describing the data collection activities and associated files. Collect of CTD data will be conducted at fixed survey stations (approximately 115 stations on each of two surveys) plus occasional unscheduled stations (less than 20 total). Data products will include raw scan data files, processed and bin averaged data files, sample bottle files, and a report describing the data collection activities and associated files.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall assure that data collected by the oceanographic program meet high standards. This may require re-processing of historical data collected by previous AMLR surveys with up-to-date algorithms. Quality control and assurance procedures shall include error checking for all stations. Basic QA will also require data entry into a US AMLR database that will record station and cast information at each sampling station.</p>
<p>Period of performance is a base year from date of award through September 30, 2010 and four (4) option years. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541990 with a size standard of $7 million. All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA) is required. <strong>NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.</strong> No solicitation document is available.

No information was submitted by other qualified candidates in response to the sources sought announcement posted on 07/02/09 in FedBizOpps. Therefore, we have concluded that Marintek/DNV, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) may submit a proposal, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.

<DESC><p>The Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service (FMS) has awarded a modification (number 0006) under contract TFMS-HQ-08-K-0044, in the dollar amount of $89,385.00. This modification is in support of the required changes to the claims, cancellation and accounting programs in the FMS Payment and Claims Enhanced Reconciliation (PACER) On-Line System, as a result of the new requirements that are associated with the Economic Recovery Payments (ERP) being issued. PACER On-Line System has to update a total of 17 programs in order to process the ERP payments and handle the claims, cancellations and accounting associated with those payments. Each agency that is involved with the ERP payments has some unique requirements for how the data needs to be handled and processed, so in addition to all the changes that are being made there is thorough end to end testing planned with each of the agencies involved.</p>
<p><br />The work required for the PACER upgrade could not be defined in a way to enable a fixed price modification; number of hours required for the work is unknown. The modification used an estimated labor hour pricing structure consistent with the basic PACER support contract which was awarded as a labor hour contract. This is a modification under a competitively awarded contract. There is no potential to transition the Recovery Act work to a fixed price structure since the upgrade will be a one time event.</p>
<p><br />Computer Sciences Corporation (large business) was the successful vendor for this contract which was awarded on April 1, 2008, under GSA schedule contract number GS-35F-4381G.</p>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>DE-AC03-99SF21530
<MODNBR>91
<DESC><p><br />1. Agency and Contracting Activity: The United States Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Environmental Management (EM), Consolidated Business Center (CBC), Office of Contracting (OOC), intends to contract through other than full and open competition. This document provides the justification and approval for the use of non-competitive procedures pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a).
<p>2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: The action being approved is the negotiation of a non-competitive extension of contract DE-AC03-99SF21530 with The Boeing Company (Boeing), which is due to expire on September 30, 2008.</p>
<p>3. Description of Services Required to Meet Agency's Needs:</p>
<p>A. Background:</p>
<p>(1). Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL), located on approximately 2,850 acres in the hills between Chatsworth and Simi Valley, CA, was developed as a remote site to test rocket engines and conduct nuclear research. The Atomics International unit of Rockwell International's Canoga Park-based Rocketdyne Division began in 1947. Thousands of open-air rocket tests were conducted at the site that supported the space program. In 1996, Rockwell International sold its aerospace and defense business, including the SSFL, to Boeing. The areas that encompass the SSFL are either owned by Boeing or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p>
<p>(2). The Atomic Energy Commission built a small nuclear power plant to deliver energy to the commercial grid at the lab. Research also included nuclear powered space vehicles and sodium coolant medium with ten small reactors. DOE performed research work on 90 acres at the former Energy Technology and Engineering Center (ETEC). All nuclear research work at ETEC was completed in 1988, with all reactor operations ending in 1980. Beginning in the 1960s, several facilities were removed once there was no longer a need for the specific facility.</p>
<p>(3). DOE conducted an Environmental Assessment for the cleanup and closure of ETEC, and in March 2003, issued a decision finding no significant impact in its Environmental Assessment (DOE/EA-1345) Cleanup and Closure of the Energy Technology Engineering Center. This decision was challenged by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Committee to Bridge the Gap, and the City of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>(4). In May 2007, a District Judge ruled against DOE in a challenge to the Environmental Assessment (DOE/EA-1345) Cleanup and Closure of the Energy Technology Engineering Center. Specifically on May 2, 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Natural Resources Council et al. v. DOE et al.) issued a decision which directed DOE to complete an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Record of Decision (ROD) for Area IV of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL). The EIS and ROD are currently being prepared for DOE by CDM, A Joint Venture (CDM) under a task order, with completion scheduled for December 31, 2010.</p>
<p>(5). In August 2007, the California Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) issued a Consent Order to DOE, NASA, and Boeing under its Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) authority. This Order (a) requires cleanup of all chemically contaminated soils at SSFL by 2017 or earlier; (b) provides the option for DTSC to require more work to be conducted offsite from Area IV to assess air, soil and water contamination; and (c) requires the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR), pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act. The EIS being prepared by CDM may be used in the preparation of the EIR required by the DTSC Consent Order.</p>
<p>(6). The current period of performance for contract DE-AC03-99SF21530 with Boeing ends on September 30, 2008. The required period for the sole source modification will extend the contract performance period through September 30, 2011. The contract extension will only include the services needed to (a) economically maintain and monitor the ETEC site in a state that assures the protection of the workers, the public and the environment; and (b) comply with all applicable laws and regulations and DOE policy. Continuation of site services through September 30, 2011, will facilitate fulfillment of the May 2, 2007, U.S. District Court decision.</p>
<p>B. Required Services:</p>
<p>(1). DOE, EM, CBC, OOC, intends to issue a sole source modification to extend the period of performance under contract DE-AC03-99SF21530 with Boeing to provide interim services to safely and economically maintain and monitor the ETEC site during the period required to complete the EIS and ROD for Area IV of the SSFL.</p>
<p>(2). As a result of the decision rendered by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, coupled with DTSC's suspension of its review of the Closure Plan submitted by Boeing for the closure of the Radioactive Materials Handling Facility (RMHF) at ETEC, a partial Termination for Convenience for contract DE-AC03-99SF21530 was issued by DOE to Boeing on July 18, 2007. The remaining contract services are required through the extension period to provide continuity of facilities operation and site support services. These services include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>(a) Work associated with RCRA Facility Investigation Report development, including characterization and document preparation in response to the State of California Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) DTSC Consent Order for Corrective Action (Docket No. P3-07/08-003, Aug 16, 2007);</p>
<p>(b) Work associated with the requirements to retrieve and produce all historical documents and records, including photographs, maps, figures of SSFL and surrounding areas, data table summaries and bibliographies, as required by the State of California EPA DTSC Control Consent Order for Corrective Action (Docket No. P3-07/08-003, August 16, 2007);</p>
<p>(c) Perform all environmental monitoring within Area IV of the SSFL as required by regulations, statutes, and DOE policy;</p>
<p>(d) Provide support to the DOE EIS contractor (CDM), including but not limited to, providing data from past sample analysis for Area IV of the SSFL;</p>
<p>(e) Place all buildings into a safe shutdown mode, ensuring that all buildings are maintained in a safe and stable configuration throughout the performance period or until facility removal;</p>
<p>(f) Complete disposition of waste generated prior to July 18, 2007, (the date of the Termination for Convenience), or newly generated wastes resulting from maintenance, monitoring, analyses or characterization activities; and</p>
<p>(g) All safety and health, landlord activities, program support, waste management and all other related activities as described in the Statement of Work for contract DE AC03 99SF21530.</p>
<p>4. Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:</p>
<p>The Competition in Contracting Act (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)), implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), authorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. Unique Contractor Qualifications:</p>
<p>A. The ETEC environmental restoration and remediation work began in 1990 under a Management and Operating (M&amp;O) contract (DE-AC03-76SF00700) with Rockwell International's Rocketdyne Division, at a time when the primary mission of ETEC was to conduct nuclear energy research and development activities. As DOE-sponsored research and development activities ceased, the ETEC mission changed to one of environmental restoration and remediation, waste management, and related support activities. Boeing North American Inc. / Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power (BNA-Rocketdyne P&amp;P) purchased the Rocketdyne Division in December 1996. The change in the ETEC mission required DOE and BNA-Rocketdyne P&amp;P to enter into a non-M&amp;O form of contractual arrangement which included terms and conditions suitable to the environmental restoration and remediation activities. The selection process was a non-competitive process and the services of BNA-Rocketdyne P&amp;P were solicited on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). The Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) for the resultant contract anticipated that, with the exception of long-term ground water treatment and monitoring, there would be no future requirements for environmental restoration of the ETEC site after work under the contract was completed. Contract DE AC03 99SF21530 was awarded to BNA-Rocketdyne P&amp;P on December 31, 1998. During the period of performance of the contract, the contractor's name changed to The Boeing Company.</p>
<p>B. As follows, unique and special circumstances, many of which existed at the time of award of contract DE-AC03-99SF21530, also currently warrant the award of a contract extension to Boeing:</p>
<p>(1). Cooperative Permits: The California DTSC issues RCRA related permits for the ETEC site. There are currently two facilities at ETEC for which DTSC has issued cooperative permits to both DOE and Boeing. These two facilities are the RMHF (buildings 4021, 4022 and 4621 only) and the Hazardous Waste Management Facility. The process of modifying the permits to change the holder to a new contractor would be difficult, time-consuming and expensive. It is anticipated this modification process would take between 3-12 months depending on information available to DTSC about the qualifications and past performance of the new contractor. Such a delay could jeopardize timely compliance with the Consent Order and disrupt completion of the EIS.</p>
<p>(2). Duplication of Costs: If a contractor other than Boeing were to take on the current contract requirements at ETEC, that contractor would have to develop the same level of knowledge and expertise regarding the individual facilities and release sites that Boeing possesses. The resulting delays and duplicate costs while a new contractor developed the required expertise would be compounded by the very real potential to disrupt CDM's ongoing performance of the EIS task order for Area IV of the SSFL. Interface between Boeing and CDM is very critical to successful EIS completion. Furthermore, it is reasonably likely that a new contractor will qualify its acceptance of the technical and engineering data previously developed for DOE by Boeing. That is, a new contractor would likely either want to confirm the accuracy of previously collected data or, alternatively, to qualify its own work product by noting that its conclusions are predicated on data for which it is not responsible. In either case, EIS would likely be delayed and more expensive. There is a reasonable expectation of substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>(3). Access Issues: ETEC is located within the SSFL, a secure, limited access facility jointly owned by Boeing and NASA. The only physical access to ETEC is through the SSFL. If DOE were to award the contract to someone other than Boeing, site access to ETEC could become extremely contentious. As the land owner, Boeing has ultimate responsibility for the condition of its property and for the conduct of operations on its property.</p>
<p>(4). Infrastructure Support: All infrastructure support for ETEC is provided by Boeing as part of its operation of the SSFL, including road maintenance, water and sewer services, electrical power, physical security, site access control, fire protection and safety and health support. DOE would need to enter into a contract with Boeing for these types of services even if another contractor were to be awarded a contract for the environmental restoration and remediation work.</p>
<p>(5). RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI) Groupings: There are a number of non-severable RFI sites within Area IV or in close proximity to Area IV which overlap into other Boeing-owned and NASA-owned areas of the SSFL. Additional Surveillance and Maintenance (S&amp;M) activities in the overlapped groupings are required to continue while the Area IV EIS is being performed. There have been no EPA regulator challenges to Boeing's process for conducting S&amp;M activities. DOE does not have the authority to force Boeing to use a DOE contractor to perform the required S&amp;M activities for the overlapped groupings. In addition, even though there are RFI groupings that do not overlap, it is not practicable to compete these services as they are of relatively low dollar value. The mobilization costs required for a new contractor to perform the services would not be recovered through competition. As previously stated, Boeing will be conducting sampling activities as they complete S&amp;M requirements. Transitioning to a new contractor to conduct these S&amp;M activities would jeopardize the completion of the EIS. The integration and communication between Boeing and CDM is critical to optimize the flow of existing data and site information.</p>
<p>6. Efforts to Solicit Offers from as many Potential Sources as Practicable:</p>
<p>On July 21, 2008, DOE issued a synopsis stating the intent to issue a sole source modification to extend the period of performance under contract DE-AC03-99SF21530 with Boeing. Though not a formal request for proposals or an invitation for bids, interested parties were afforded an opportunity to respond within fifteen (15) days (August 4, 2008).</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Anticipated Cost:</p>
<p>A. The contract with Boeing was originally awarded with an effective date of December 31, 1998. The current total estimated contract value is approximately $162 million for the entire contract period of performance through September 30, 2008. Using current contract baseline and cost report information, with an estimated value of $13 million per year, the total value of the three-year extension is estimated to be $39 million.</p>
<p>B. The original contract estimated costs and fee were determined fair and reasonable with negotiated settlement on December 8, 1998. A Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data in accordance with FAR 15.4 was executed by BNA-Rocketdyne P&amp;P on December 15, 1998. The determination of the fair and reasonable price for the extension will also be by negotiated settlement and will consider terms and conditions of the current contract, current rates and factors, and other applicable cost or pricing related matters. A Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data will be required after settlement on the extension proposal.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research Conducted:</p>
<p>A formal market survey was not conducted for this extension. No responses from interested contractors were received by the DOE to the contract extension synopsis which was posted on July 21, 2008. If the services contained in this extension are not continued without disruption, DOE would not meet its regulatory mandates at ETEC and Area IV of the SSFL to protect the workers, the public and the environment.</p>
<p>9. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>10. Listing of Interested Sources:</p>
<p>There were no responses received in the timeframe allowed by the synopsis posted on July 21, 2008. Boeing will be the only source solicited.</p>
<p>11. Actions to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition Before any Subsequent Acquisition for the Services Required:</p>
<p>With the results of the EIS and ROD being completed for Area IV of the SSFL by December 2010, DOE will have much more refined information available to determine follow-on ETEC site remediation requirements. The extended period of performance positions DOE to conduct an acquisition for remediation activities required to complete closure of ETEC site at that time. The acquisition will be conducted on a competitive basis using existing multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts, small business set-aside, or other competitive acquisition approaches most appropriate at the time.</p>
