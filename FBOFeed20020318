The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) plans to modify Contract N01MH80004 with Washington University (St. Louis) "NIMH Center for Genetic Studies" in accordance with provisions of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c )(1) and FAR 6.302-1.  The proposed modification will extend the contract for approximately one year to allow sufficient time to award a Cooperative Agreement for the continuation of this requirement.

The objective of contract N01MH80004 is to: (1) receive clinical, diagnostic, pedigree structure, and other data and blood samples from a large number of organizations performing genetics studies with grant and contract support from NIMH; (2) process these data and materials to create and maintain electronic databases, high-quality lymphoblastoid cell lines, and DNA samples that are incorporated with comparable existing data and biomaterials in the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative (http://www-grb.nimh.nih.gov/gi.html); and (3) widely distribute all data and materials in the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative to qualified investigators in the scientific community.

Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this final phase of the study.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. Please contact David Eskenazi, NIMH Contracting Officer, at 301-443-2696 or deskenaz@mail.nih.gov for further information.

Day to day operations and methods of conducting business shall be coordinated with the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) and/or the individual Medical Center Representative. I. SCOPE OF SERVICES FOR CONTRACTOR’S PREFERRED PRICING PROGRAM A.  Purpose of  Preferred Pricing Program (PPP) The purpose of the PPP is to assist the VA in meeting their economic objectives.  The VA will not endorse or refer eligible veterans to individual physicians or PPO networks.  When eligible veterans receive their healthcare from providers in the private sector through the VA Fee Basis, the PPP allows participating VAMCs to share in the savings available through the discounts in managed care networks.   The program allows savings for a variety of health care services through Contractor's provider networks including  hospitalization, outpatient care, ambulatory surgery, behavioral health, ancillary and other services. B. Preferred Pricing Program Processes The contractor will perform preferred pricing services.  This includes making health care provider networks available to the VA and providing the preferred price to the VA so the VA can then pay the provider.   1. When eligible veterans use PPP providers for hospitalizations, inpatient services, outpatient care, ambulatory surgery, dental, professional services, ancillary, and other services; discounted rates will be available to VAMCs participating in the PPP.' 2. All PPP providers will submit their claims to the individual VAMC.  The VAMC establishes eligibility, that the service is a covered benefit, and determines the VA allowable (the amount the VA will pay on that particular claim).   The participating VAMC will document the VA allowable amount on the claim and forward claims greater than $150 to the contractor.  The contractor will verify the providers participation with the contractor's PPO and annotate their best price for the services claimed, returning the information to the VAMC.  The VAMC will determine the best value to the government and make payment on that basis.  Reporting and invoicing protocols assume the VA will select the lesser of the two prices.   3. The contractor will provide monthly reports detailing the price the VAMC would have paid comparing it to the Contractor preferred price.  These reports must be provided within 10 days of the end of the calendar month in which the service was provided.  Contractor will calculate the amount saved and use that amount for invoicing. C. Preferred Pricing Program requires activities from four different entities.     The VA will exercise oversight of the contractor and will have responsibilities for some portions of the claims flow.   The VA will issue the payments to providers from VA funds.  D. VA Responsibility: 1. VAMCs will appoint a liaison to assist in coordinating with internal VAMC assets.  2. VAMCs must: copy claims; forward and receive copied documents from the PPP contractor; track and reconcile claims; reconcile and certify monthly invoices.  3. The VA will retain responsibility for payment to providers submitting authorized claims. 4. VAMCs will retain the responsibility for making payments to the contractor for certified savings in accordance with Section V.  Participating Medical Centers may provide a No Charge (N/C) purchase order to the contractor to initiate this BOA.   E. Contractor Responsibility: 1. The contractor will serve as the prime contractor with overall responsibility for program management.  The contractor will integrate all subcontractor activities.  The contractor will ensure access to and adequacy of a discounted network to achieve savings from Medicare rates.  The contractor's payment administrator will process the claims from receipt up to, but not including, issuance of payment. 2. Provide VAMCs access to managed care provider networks offering discounts. 3. Working with internal and external claims personnel. 4. Re-pricing and returning claims within 6 business days for paper or fax claims and 3 business days for EDI claims.  Invoices not processed within the designated turnaround time will be treated as non-discountable and processed by the VA accordingly.  The contractor fee will be paid only when the network price is used – claims not meeting the turnaround time will not be considered for reimbursement unless the PPP is utilized. 5. Contractor will prepare an individual pricing form for every claim and return it to the VA with the discounted price clearly written on it. 6. Provide opportunity for future EDI transmission of claims. 7. Submit standard reports in a timely manor.  Quarterly reports to VISN 23 shall include a summary of each participating facility's demonstrated cost savings.  Monthly summary reports for each VAMC's Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) will be provided with the invoice for fee reimbursement. ( See Paragraph I B 3 and Section III.) 8. The contractor will pay for overnight or second day shipping when it is used. II.	PROJECT PLAN A Project Plan will be developed that includes the following: 1. Implementation Meeting (Representatives from the contractor, VAMC fee or business office, and the COTR) a. Review process b. Review responsibilities c. Identify key contact personnel d. Develop timeline estimates e. Gather claims volume estimates f. Identify known problem areas 2. Agree upon post-payment adjustment protocol. 3. Discuss interface with Claims staff (internal and external). 4. Schedule meeting with Claims staff for implementation.  The contractor personnel will travel to and from implementation meetings at the contractor’ expense. 5. Gather provider contract information. 6. Make recommendations for modifying provider contracts as needed.   7. Perform preferred pricing. 8. Review Medical Center and COTR reports. 9. Conduct savings review with COTR. 10. Monitor preferred pricing process. 11. Establish ability to download claims electronically 12. Make recommendations to improve the effectiveness of preferred pricing. III.	VALIDATING SAVINGS The individual VAMCs will retain the right to review and otherwise audit any part of the preferred pricing process at any time.  The contractor will submit monthly reports to the VAMC showing claims submitted and claims with savings.  This report will list the VA price and the contractor price. The contractor will use this savings report to generate invoices to each VAMC.   IV.	PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY The contractor will comply with all statutory, regulatory, and VA policy requirements related to patient privacy and confidentiality.  Reference FAR 52.224-1 Privacy Act Notification (Apr 1984) and FAR 52.224-2 Privacy Act (Apr 1984) of this agreement. V.	PRICING The contractor will provide preferred pricing services to the Department of Veterans Affairs.  If there is no savings, there is no fee.  The contractor fee is a percentage of savings on a per claim basis.  The VA pays nothing until savings are realized.  There is no additional fee beyond the percentage of savings fee.

Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems is the only know source with the knowledge, experience and resources to perform the work that will be required by the Government.  As the original equipment manufacturer of both the legacy combat systems and the Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) based AN/UYQ-70 Combat System, they are the only firm that can provide a seamless transition from the current legacy systems to the COTS based systems.  LM Tactical Systems has also developed unique resources and tools to access systems' configuration data.  Therefore, the Government would incur substantial costs and systems support delays in attempting to develop alternate sources.

The Government anticipates an award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about  April 1, 2002.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses from this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) is not available.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA This acquisition is a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  Perform an inventory of the dead down fuels of the Continuous Forest Inventory (CFI) plots and gather data of specified plots into the Global Positioning System (GPS). The fuels loading data will be used in mitigating the potential fire hazards that may occur in areas having heavy concentrations of fuels. The Government will perform data analysis and enter the data into the Global Information System (GIS) mapping system to generate two fire/fuels management layers (fuel loading and fire behavior/modeling). The layers in conjunction with current GIS data will serve as a Government management tool to prioritize and plan the placement/construction of strategic/tactical fuel breaks, prescribed burning activity and reduction of hazardous fuels on the Jicarilla Apache Indian Nation lands.

<DESC>This is a draft request for proposal for acquisition of the Visual Information Management System (VIMS) for the Defense Visual Information (DVI) directorate of the American Forces Information Service (AFIS.)  This draft is published with the intention of obtaining comment from interested sources regarding acquisition approach, including the use of a Statement of Objectives (SOO) as a requirements specification document, the line item structure and the use of indefinite quantity line items to satisfy customer demand, as well as the use of the evaluation criteria shown in the draft RFP. The VIMS will help meet DVI modernization objectives by using advanced technologies to ingest, index, store, search, distribute, and manage Visual Information. The system will also supply DVI the ability to capture and automate the storage of motion media, still media, graphics, audio, and documents/text.  The SOO calls for innovative approaches to accomplish these objectives.  The line item structure is designed to promote innovation by allowing potential offerors the ability to configure solutions to various requirements within the generalized line item descriptions.  The indefinite quantity line item descriptions and the estimated annual quantities to be ordered against these line items are still being established at this time.  The overall structure of these line items can be determined by examining appendix 7 to the SOO.

All interested parties are advised that this is only a draft RFP.  It has not been subjected to higher headquarters review, and may change as a result of such reviews.  No offers will be accepted as a result of the publication of this draft RFP.  It is published merely to determine if there are any impediments in the approach taken to obtaining a system that meets the stated objectives.  This approach includes the use of indefinite quantity line items to make versions of the system available to authorized visual information activities according to their needs.  

Comments should be directed to Bill Gilmore at (909) 413-2412, fax (909) 413-2432, e-mail gilmorw@dodmedia.osd.mil.

<DESC>The national Asset Supply Chain Management (ASCM) program represents an integrated solution aimed at addressing FAA-wide lifecycle asset management requirements.  The ASCM system will provide an efficient, effective, and integrated national system to provide asset management functions, thereby providing seamless support to headquarters, regional, and remote field users.  ASCM provides this support over several functional areas: <P>  - Physical Asset Accountability (property management) <P>  - Configuration Management <P>  - Asset History <P>  - Inventory Management <P>  - Acquisition Support <P>  - Workflow Management <P>  - Document Management & Forms <P>  - External system interfaces <P>  The technical approach envisioned for national ASCM embraces multi-vendor interoperability, open standards, and scalable designs that integrate client/server and web-based solutions through distributed object technology.  The FAA will achieve this vision using a distributed network-centric enterprise-wide architecture.  Architectures that fulfill these objectives are embodied in commercial off-the-shelf/non-developmental item (COTS/NDI) Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) applications available from several vendors.  <P> The FAA is planning to issue a solicitation to acquire a COTS EAM solution and systems integration support.  The successful offeror will provide the COTS solution and integration skills required for the full lifecycle support of the national ASCM program. <P> An Initial Requirements Document (iRD) was published in October 1999 (see attachment).  This document is currently being expanded and will be used as part of the Request for Offer (RFO).  In a separate but related effort defined within the iRD, the FAA Logistics Center (FAALC) is currently developing increased capabilities, referred to as the Logistics Center Support System (LCSS).  Aimed at performing as a stand-alone solution, the LCSS requirements identified in the iRD will not be part of the national ASCM solution set, other than as an interface. <P> In February 2000, the FAA conducted an Industry Day to understand the current state of EAM products and to gain insight into the applicability of these products to the FAA's asset supply chain management requirements, as defined in the national ASCM iRD.   <P> In conjunction with the Industry Day, the FAA issued a Market Survey questionnaire to vendors expressing an interest in the national ASCM program.  The information gathered as part of the responses to that questionnaire enabled the FAA to validate and verify the COTS / NDI alternative selected for the program's implementation strategy.   <P> The FAA plans to release a Screening Information Request (SIR) to industry in mid to late March 2002, seeking full and open competition, in which to develop an offerors list.  This SIR will include specific evaluation criteria to determine the experience, skills, and capabilities of prospective offerors.  The SIR will be posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities Website. <P> Following the SIR, the FAA plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) in early June 2002, to those offerors who have successfully satisfied the above mentioned criteria.  This RFO will include contract terms and conditions, Statement of Work (SOW), and evaluation criteria specific to the requirement.  Subsequently, qualified offerors will be required to perform Operational Capabilities Demonstrations (OCD) using scenarios developed by the FAA. <P> The FAA anticipates a Calendar Year 2002 award of a national ASCM contract for the development of a program that ties together the management and control of all assets within the FAA under one single system.  The performance period shall consist of a base year plus four separately priced option years. <P> This announcement is for information only and is not a request for proposals. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this public announcement, or reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to the SIR/RFO. <P>  <P> Attachments:  Initial Requirements Document Asset Supply Chain Management (ASCM) < http://www.faa.gov/ats/af/afz.htm#afz500 > <P>

<DESC>This announcement replaces the announcement issued 03/12/2001 for solicitation # 50ABNC200056.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation number 50ABNC200056 is issued as a request for proposals(RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-17. This procurement action is full and open. The associated North American Industrial Classification System code is 33412.  A firm is a small business for the purpose of this requirement if the size standard is 1,000 employees or less. 

The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) requires the charter of a submersible or Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) as well as the captain and crew necessary to monitor benthic recovery from a cable laying.  OCNMS authorized a special use permit allowing Pacific Crossing to install 2 fiber optic cables (PC-1) through 30 nm of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS).  OCNMS will be monitoring benthic recovery from the cable laying.  This scope of work (SOW) addresses an OCNMS charter for the provision of a vessel, captain and crew and a submersible or an ROV associated equipment and staff to support research as further described in this solicitation.  Contractors must bid on the complete package.  The charter is for 8 to 16 days between 12 August and 20 September 2002 for OCNMS to conduct investigations within the Sanctuary aboard a contracted vessel (>80 ft) using a contracted submersible or ROV.  The contract can be divided into two separate cruises or approximate equal duration during the contract period of 12 August through 20 September, as needed; however, OCNMS will support one mobilization/ demobilization event.  The contractor responsibilities are listed below.
Project Area: The project concentrates on 2 types of areas: the cable route and control sites.  Although primary operations are in the areas described they are not limited to these areas. The cable route of interest in OCNMS is ~30 nm.  The primary operation will be along the eastern cable between 124o40'W to 125o10'W and 48o 20'N to 48o 30'N, although some sites along the northern cable may also be surveyed.  
 The other areas to be searched for and monitored will be control sites, which have yet to be determined.  The general areas of operation along the cable and the control sites will be between 124o40'W to 125o30'W and between 48o00N to 48o30N in U.S. waters.
Scope of Work:  The cruise will be between 8 and 16 continuous days of operation in the OCNMS.  A port day can be added but it is not considered as one of the 8 to 16 continuous days.  Mobilization and demobilization days are in addition to the 8 to 16 days of operation within the sanctuary.  Vessel operations will be conducted 24 hours per day, regardless if an Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) or a submersible is selected.  ROV activities would involve 24 hour operations.   Submersible activities would be conducted during 12 hr/day (daylight) and shipboard sampling during night operations. The cruise shall be completed between August 12 and September 20, 2002.  The dates and length of the cruise will be set at the time the contract is awarded.  Loading of contractor equipment can be done at the location of the contractors choice; however, contractor shall plan for OCNMS staging (mobilizing) in Port Angeles, WA by contacting the US Coast Guard and City of Port Angeles for access to the city pier.   Demobilization can occur in either Port Angeles or Neah Bay, WA and will be set at the time the contract is awarded.

Bid packages should be based on the 8-day research cruise plus mobilization and demobilization, with a daily rate for each additional research day for up to 16 days.

Vessel : The contractor shall supply a vessel, with crew, of sufficient size/tonnage to operate 24 hours per day, for 8 to 16 days, up to 50 nm off the Washington Coast.  The minimum vessel length is 80 ft.  The vessel must have appropriate deck equipment (winches, metering device, A-frames, davits, etc.) and operators to deploy the equipment and support the operations below.  The vessel must also accommodate 6 OCNMS staff or contracted personnel with berthing, shower & head.  If the vessel can accommodate more than 6 staffing provided as a cost option.  Separate quarters shall be provided for men and women.   The vessel shall provide 3 nutritious meals and  snack during each 24 hr period.  The vessel shall be equipped with a differential global positioning system (DGPS) andf contractor proposes an ROV then vessel must have a dynamic ship positioning system or equivalent.

The vessel shall provide ~32 ft2, near the A-Frame or davit for OCNMS for handling sediment samples and gear.  A low pressure (15-30 psi) salt-water hose for use at this deck location is also required.  The vessel shall allow for ~3 ft3 of refrigerator space and ~64 ft2 of deck space for storing samples.  The contractor must also supply counter space to set up a computer inside the vessel but within 15 m of the A-frame, to run cable.

The vessel must be equipped with a winch or suitable device to launch and recover a submersible or ROV.  The vessel must be equipped with a winch & A-Frame or davit capable of deploying and retrieving up to 300 pds of oceanographic equipment, such as a sediment grab sampler, and a CTD rosette to a depth of 350m.  The CTD rosette has an auto fire module and does not require a conducting cable on the winch. The winch must be equipped with a cable counter to determine the approximate depth of instrument deployment.  Fresh water on deck shall be provided for instrument wash down.

Submersible or ROV:   The contractor shall provide an ROV or submersible, operator(s), and externally mounted camera gear capable of taking both vertical and oblique color video and still photography of high resolution as to be able to identify sediment type and benthic organisms.  At least one of the two video cameras must record onto digital, mini DV tapes, and preferably both.  Real time shipboard viewing of ROV results or internal viewing in a submersible of the video shall be provided.  The contractor will also provide appropriate lighting for both still & video photography.  The submersible shall be capable of 8-10 hr dive time/day (12 hr operations), operating in contact with or near the seafloor over potentially rugged substrate.  If a submersible is used, it shall be able to accommodate at a minimum, 1 contractor supplied operator and 1 OCNMS scientist, with viewing ports accessible to the scientist at all times during the dive.  

The ROV shall be capable of 24 hr. operations per day operating in contact with or near the seafloor over potentially rugged substrate.

Each video shall have mounted 2-4 lasers emitting parallel beams to allow quantitative analysis from video footage or equivalent.  The viewing angle of one video camera shall be vertical and a second video will be adjustable from horizontal to vertical or held at an oblique angle.  All recorded video shall be tagged with date, time, & position of the ROV or submersible as computed in an Integrated Navigation System (INS) using DGPS & an ultra short baseline (USB) or similar system to be provided by the contractor.  Geographic positions shall be in NAD83 or WGS84 coordinates.  

Film will be supplied by OCNMS upon consultation with contractor.  The 35 still  camera shall be capable of taking automated vertical shots of sufficient resolution to be able to identify sediment type & benthic organisms.  A system (e.g., mounted quadrant) for determining the area covered by the photograph shall be provided by the contractor.

The height off bottom of the vehicle shall be maintained at a constant and recorded, such that the area of field of view is known.  The speed of the vehicle shall be maintained at 0.5 to 1.0 knots in order for the benthic organisms to be identified.

A mechanism for maintaining position or course over the buried fiber optics cable must be provided (e.g., magnetometer or via tone sensor) externally mounted on the ROV or submersible to ensure the proper study area is evaluated.  The contractor must verify equipment will work prior to cruise.  Although the location of the buried cable is known (an ROV survey of the entire route has been conducted), unless the accuracy of the navigation system is sufficient, locating the cable visually by the former trench along the seafloor can be problematic.  The ROV or submersible is required to maintain its position directly over the buried cable when transects are conducted along the cable.

The ROV or submersible shall be outfitted with a contractor- supplied conductivity, temperature, depth & oxygen-sensing array that is linked to an operational data logging system.  It is preferred that this information is received as an electronic file.

The ROV or submersible must be capable of collecting benthic infauna organisms and sediment cores at depths ranging between approximately 60 to 350m.  The samples will be processed by OCNMS for grain size and benthic taxonomy, at a minimum.  The sample collection is part of this SOW (e.g. manipulator arm and sampling device on the submersible or ROV, and a contractor-supplied winch operator working with OCNMS staff during night operations), but the sample processing is not.  The three types of sample are: 1) a method of quantitatively collecting & holding 3 or 5 sediment cores of approximate 15 cm diameter, 10 cm depth or 15 cubic centimeter box cores or equivalent per dive on an ROV or submersible; 2) a method for collecting benthic infauna covering approximately 0.1m2  area to a depth of approximately 6 cm, (e.g. suction sampler, grab sampler or equivalent device); and 3) a winch & davit or A-Frame plus operator to help conduct shipboard sediment sampling.  OCNMS shall provide the sediment sampler for this latter shipboard method.  The sediment and benthic infauna samplers (1 and 2 above) are to be provided by the contractor after approval by OCNMS.

Additional Requirements:
Reports & Documentation:  Marine Operations Abstract (MOA) - The contractor shall record & maintain an MOA throughout the cruise.  The MOA is a form for recording operational milestones along with date, time, & position.  The MOA shall be logged at every significant operational event & every 30 minutes during the cruise.  OCNMS will provide the MOA forms.  All times shall be recorded in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  Other forms required by OCNMS will be integrated into the MOA.  A copy of the completed MOA shall be provided to ONCNMS upon completion of the cruise.  The contractor shall record digitally the geographic position of the vessel throughout the cruise with positions logged every minute.  Geographic positions shall be in NAD83 or WGS84 coordinates & recorded to accuracy equivalent to the 5th decimal place using decimal degrees.  A digital track line file in ASCII format shall be provided to OCNMS at the completion of the project.

Data recording by the contractor shall include daily reports describing the dive(s) occurring during each 24 hr period.  This information should include at a minimum, the dive number, depth of the dive, latitude and longitude of dive, latitude and longitude for the beginning and end of any transects conducted, latitude and longitude of any samples collected, type of sample collected, and notes of any other types of data collected on the dive (e.g. temperature, visibility, estimated current speed).  The latitude and longitude records can be included as part of the navigation files but must include identification of the events associated with records (e.g. "sample 1 collected").  OCNMS will work with the contractor to define what should be recorded. 

Communications:  Because the scientific staff may need to communicate with other research vessels, commercial vessels, & shore based facilities, the Chief Scientist or designee shall have access to use of radio transceivers & other available communication equipment

Mechanical Breakdown:   The contractor is responsible for maintaining all contractor provided equipment & vessels in a safe operating condition during the contract performance.   If a mechanical breakdown occurs of the vessel or ROV or submersible that is >12 hrs, the vessel & ROV/submersible shall be considered to be off charter for the purposes of billing.   The contractor shall make every reasonable effort to solve any problem causing the vessel and/or ROV/submersible and/or equipment to be out of service, & bring it back into service as quickly as possible to continue contract performance.

Fuel & Water:  The contractor is responsible for providing all fuel needed to perform the contract.  Any breaks from contract work to take fuel or water will be considered time off charter, for billing purposes.

Selection:  The selection of a contractor will be on the basis of price & technical ability.   Technical ability includes past performance & ability to meet the intent of OCNMS researchers.   The technical evaluation & price evaluation are equal in importance.   The price evaluation will involve comparing the price of 8 days ROV operation to 16 days submersible operation since this provides an approximate equivalent bottom viewing time.

<DESC>Special Note: Reference Original CBDNet Posting of Synopsis December 17, 2001, against Submission Number SN5149S5.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to solicit proposals for a five-year, Performance Based Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC or IDIQ), utilizing either Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) or Cost-Reimbursement (cost-plus-fixed-fee) (CPFF), Cost Reimbursement-no fee, pricing/payment methods for task orders to be issued. We anticipate that the solicitation will be released on or about January 24, 2002. This RFP incorporates the services previously synopsized under M/OP-01-994 for Womens Legal Rights. USAID will be making multiple awards (up to six) for technical assistance and advisory services to support mission in the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development to help ensure that women participate fully and benefit equally from U.S. development assistance programs. [The RFP will result in the award of up to six (6) Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs); up to three under full and open competition, two under a partial set-aside for small business concerns, and one under a set-aside for small disadvantaged business (8[a]) concerns]. Today the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development office assists the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with integration of gender concerns into all USAID programs, coordinates with the donor community, and identifies emerging issues where gender is a key concern. The office has four strategic objectives: Enhancing the economic status of women; Expanding educational opportunities for girls and women; Improving women's legal rights and increasing their participation in civil society; and Integrating gender considerations throughout USAID programs. In pursuing these objectives, the WID Office supports technical assistance and training for USAID Missions, host countries and non-governmental organizations (NOGs); promotes greater awareness of gender issues through publications and conferences; and funds studies of emerging issues. The purpose of this contract is to acquire quick-response short- and long-term technical services, including reports and other deliverables, for the implementation of EGAT/WIDs strategy, which includes support to other USAID operating units in integrating gender considerations into their programs and activities. The quick-response short- and long-term technical services into five major areas:(1)Technical Assistance and Training;(2)Legal;(3)Communications and Outreach (including conference planning and implementation);(4) Grants; and(5)Research. USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of U.S. small businesses, U.S. small disadvantaged businesses, U.S. women-owned small businesses, and U.S. HUBZone small businesses in this activity as prime or subcontractors in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR. In this respect, it is anticipated that the prime contractor will make every reasonable effort to identify and make maximum practicable use of such concerns. To help identify potential subcontractors, a list of all organizations requesting a copy of the solicitation will be included with each solicitation issued. By providing the list, USAID does not endorse the listed organizations as being capable of carrying out the activity, nor does USAID verify the claimed status of the organizations. Necessarily, the list will contain the names of only those organizations known prior to the issuance of the solicitation. Telephone requests for the RFP will not be honored. The preferred method of distribution of USAID procurement information is via the Internet or by request of a solicitation on a 3.5 Floppy Disk. Receipt of this RFP through the Internet must be confirmed by written notification to the contact person noted below if you wish to be notified of any amendments to the solicitation.

<DESC>This notice is issued in advance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) to obtain qualified sources for the Global Positioning System (GPS) User Equipment (UE) Modernization contracts.  The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) GPS Joint Program Office (JPO) requires development, prototyping and testing of the latest generation of GPS UE. The objectives of the UE modernization program are 1) significantly increase the anti-jamming (A/J) performance of current GPS UE to ensure operation in a hostile electronic warfare environment, 2) improve security of receivers to ensure military users have access to the true GPS signal, and 3) migrate toward an achievable Open Systems Architecture (OSA) level to reduce the cost of incorporating new GPS capabilities into DoD fielded systems.  Improved accuracy and improved time to first fix (TTFF) is a primary objective.  An Industry Day, announced under a separate FedBizOps announcement, will be held on 23-25 April 2002.

<DESC>NA The Fiscal Year 2002 (FY02) Defense Appropriations Act provides $10.2 million to the Department of Defense Ovarian Cancer Research Program (OCRP) to support innovative research directed toward eliminating ovarian cancer.  This program is administered by th e U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command through the Office of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP). Proposals are sought in the following four emphasis areas:  etiology, prevention, early detection/diagnosis, and preclin ical therapeutics. The FY02 OCRP Program Announcement has an electronic proposal submission deadline of June 18, 2002.  This announcement calls for proposals in the following two new mechanisms: Idea Development Awards and Institutional Training Grants.  Idea Development Awards are designed to encourage innovative approaches to ovarian cancer research.  Idea Development Award proposals are intended to stimulate and reward innovative research ideas that may be viewed as high risk but have the potential for high gain in scientific and clinical knowledge.  These proposals should start, create, or introduce a unique or unusual approach to the study of ovarian cancer.  The research may represent a new paradigm, challenge existing paradigms, or investigate an exi sting problem from a new perspective.  All investigators are eligible to submit proposals. Institutional Training Grants are intended to encourage the initiation of new postgraduate training programs in ovarian cancer.  These awards should draw postdoctoral students focused on ovarian cancer research together in a common research and training en vironment.  These grants should address the specific emphasis of the training program but may include training of postgraduates from different disciplines who have an interest in ovarian cancer.  Inclusion of postgraduate fellows from the Historically Blac k Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions is encouraged. Detailed descriptions of each of these mechanisms, evaluation criteria, and submission requirements can be found in the FY02 OCRP Program Announcement, which can be downloaded from the CDMRP web site (http://cdmrp.army.mil).  Proposals will be received ele ctronically in FY02.  All applicants will be required to submit one electronic version of their proposal as a PDF (Portable Document Format) file.

The M58A3 and the M59 are both mine clea ring line charges (MICLIC). The MICLIC is used to clear a path for tanks, vehicles, and personnel through minefields or other obstacles.  The MICLIC consists of a linear demolition charge assembly, deployed from a steel container, by a rocket motor.  The c ontainer is used for transportation and storage.  The demolition charge assembly consists of sets of C-4 blocks assembled together along a 350 foot nylon rope/detonator cord assembly.  The major manufacturing processes for the demolition line charge assemb ly are storage, handling, and extrusion of composition C-4.  (FYI-The MICLIC utilizes the same extrusion process that the M112 demolition block and the M183 demolition charges use.  The M58A3/M59 Charge Assembly, the M112 Demo block, and the M183 Demo Char ge Assembly all share the same extrusion process.  Market research is being conducted on all three items based on the commonality of this extrusion process. The announcements for the other items are also posted in FEDBIZOPS.) The C-4 is extruded into pelle ts (halves) for the MICLIC items and solid blocks for the M112 Demolition Block and the M183 Demolition Charge. The C-4 pellets (halves) for the MICLIC items are then assembled to tension core rope, detonating cord assembly, encasement sleeves and packed i n a container with a fuze assembly and miscellaneous parts. Additional information regarding the above item can be requested from the above POC. A respondent to this market survey should be able to show that they have adequate technical capability, manufac turing capacity and good past performance in the explosives processing industry, as an indicator of your qualifications.

<DESC>This announcement is a request for information. The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is seeking information from sources that feel they are capable of providing off the shelf alternatives or technology enhancements supporting the Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS) program umbrella. The information sought through this Sources Sought supports all configurations and variants being developed under the JTWS program. JTWS variants passively detect and provide a single line of bearing on both communications and radar emitters that can be used for identification and tracking.

USSOCOM is seeking new Threat Warning solutions that can be integrated into a common operating environment for maritime, air, ground and unattended system configurations fielded on behalf of Special Operations Forces (SOF).  Originator intends to initiate a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) to determine if improved capabilities exist, through a comparison with existing commercially available capabilities that will provide advanced passive target detection and identification as follows:

Threat Warning Receivers for Body worn and Manpackable application
Software for rapid detection, signal analysis, and source localization 
Mobile GSM Monitoring systems 
GSM Phones capable of sending digital data from any source 
GSM Mobile Phone Optimization systems that increase range without repeaters
Monitoring system for 802.11 Wireless LAN 
Fly Away small, lightweight satellite dishes (.9M and 1.5M)
Bi-Static Radio Frequency Detection 
Lightweight portable FAX, PSTN, and radio link monitoring with cellular jamming

All offeror's products will be evaluated to determine the effectiveness for integration into the JTWS Component Architecture and Framework (JCAF) associated with all JTWS configurations and systems development. This capability will allow for operation in numerous geographic locations and extreme climates. All products must meet stringent requirements for size, weight, power and transportability.

This announcement is NOT a Request for Purchase. This is a Sources Sought and does not commit the Government to award a contract under the above listed terms, nor is the Government responsible to pay for samples or information received.  A cutoff date of 2 April 2002 is established for the submission of responses.  Responses should be sent to the United States Special Operations Command, ATTN: SOAL-KBA (Mr. Myron Tanner, Contract Specialist, Phone (813) 281-0560 x319, Fax (813) 281-2553, or Mr. Ed More, Contracting Officer (813) 281-0560 x277, Fax (813) 261-2658), 5850 West Cypress Boulevard, Tampa, FL 33607 or email to tannerm@socom.mil and moree@socom.mil.
