Description
This is a presolicitation notice to potential offerors to potential sources to privatize the eletrical distribution system at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, NY. Privatization, under 10 USC 2688, is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system. The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  

The Niagara Falls ARS is located about 6 miles east of the city of Niagara Falls and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York. The installation occupies roughly 985 acres, which includes 38.71 acres of land leased from the People of the State of New York acting by and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Lease No. DA NYDRE (A) 1901, which expires 30 June 2031 and 37.1 acres of land leased from Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, Lease No. DA CA51-9-84-74, which expires 30 June 2023, on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant.
The joint mission of the 914th AW and the 107th ARW is to provide trained Reservists and Guardsmen, equipment, and aircraft capable of responding to all contingencies in support of national interests. The 914th has a working population of 1,117 Reservists and 397 full time personnel, of which 209 are civilians. Buildings and apron occupy about 260 acres. The 107th has a working population of 552 assigned personnel, 260 active Reservists and military technicians, and 18 other employees. Buildings and apron occupy about 100 acres.
The location that Niagara Falls ARS now occupies began as the initial structures for the Bell Aircraft Corporation in 1943. The Installation was redesigned as a US Naval Air Station in 1946, when further expansion and construction took place. The base has expanded several times over the years and now has 107 buildings (industrial and commercial). The base has some Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing.
The Niagara Falls ARS electric distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Way. The system may include, but is not limited to, transformers, circuits, protective devices, utility poles, ductbanks, switches, street lighting fixtures, and other ancillary fixed equipment. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.
Specifically excluded from the electric distribution system privatization are:
•	Concrete encasement and ducts carrying communication lines or empty ducts in underground circuit on property of the 107th ARW
•	Parking Lot & Security Lights that are fed directly from Buildings
•	emergency generators
•	Building 850 (supplies electric to Mast Lights)
•	Airfield lighting, apron lights, airfield lighting vaults, and all associated equipment.  This includes Building 891 and the FAA transformers in Building 724.
	The 914th AW and the 107th ARW maintain separate electrical distribution systems on the Niagara Falls ARS. The separate systems are connected at a switch located on the property line between the 107th ARW and the 914th AW. The switch is gang locked open to prevent the circuit from closing and causing injuries and damage to the electrical systems. 
	Niagara Mohawk supplies electric power at two different points on the installation for the general distribution systems.  Electricity is supplied to the 914th AW through the main switch adjacent to the base entrance on Lockport Road and to the 107th ARW through a switch adjacent to the Guardian Street entrance to the base, along Tuscarora Road. Base ownership of the electric facilities starts with the main switches. Electricity is delivered to both feeds at 13.2 kV.
	The primary electrical distribution system for the 914th AW consists of an overhead, three-phase, four-wire system rated at 13.2 kV. This system was installed in the 1990’s and completely replaced the old system with new poles, wires, transformers and switches. There are overhead primary circuit, overhead secondary circuit and underground secondary circuit. 
	The electrical distribution system on the 107th ARW is also new (constructed in the 1990’s). The primary electrical distribution system for the 107th ARW consists of underground primary, three phase circuits operating at 13.2kV, underground secondary circuit and primary circuit mounted overhead on new poles. Underground lines are protected by a duct-bank consisting of four conduits encased in concrete. One conduit carries power, one conduit carries fiber optic communication line, and two conduits are empty for future use.  Only the conduit carrying the electrical wires will be transferred to the new owner.
	Both systems are master metered with secondary meters located at various locations within the base for monitoring specific building use.
A third electrical supply point exists to supply electricity to the geographically separated area at the east end of the main runway.  Building 724 is the decommissioned pump station for a decommissioned water reservoir.  Building 724 also houses electrical circuits for the FAA runway lighting system.  Building 724  and the reservoir will be demolished after funding is approved.  Building 729 contains the water meter and backflow-preventer for the main water supply system from the City of Niagara Falls.   

Inventory for the system will be included in the RFP.

The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

<DESC><p>________________________________________<br />KC-135 Aircrew Training System (ATS)<br />Contractor Logistics Support (CLS)<br />11/06/2008<br />Reference PR FD2020-10-TBD<br />________________________________________<br />Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill AFB, UT<br />Interested Sources, Informational Synopsis<br />Last updated on: 11/06/2008
<p>This announcement is provided as part of market research to identify potential contractors who have the particular experience, skills and knowledge to accomplish the effort described. The AMC/Hill AFB KC-135 ATS Acquisition Team is developing a solicitation package to support the requirement for CLS support of the ATS. This will be an acquisition of services, follow-on to the support previously acquired under the long term contract, F33657-91-C-0072 with Flight Safety Services Corp which is scheduled to expire 30 Sep 2010. The anticipated period of performance will be for five (5) years, from 01 Oct 2010 through 30 Sep 2015 (FY 2011 through FY 2016). Alternatively, a calendar year cycle may be considered, starting 01 Jan 2011.</p>
<p>The KC-135 Simulator System is comprised of 19 KC-135 Operational Flight Trainers (OFT), 2 Boom Operator Weapons System Trainers (BOWST), 27 GATM IHC Part Task Trainers (GIPTT), 11 Cockpit Familiarization Trainers (CFT) in various configurations, 400 Computer Based Training (CBT) Workstations and laptops, 25 AFMSS desktop trainers, 30 Instructor trainer laptops, 1 Cargo Loading Trainer, and courseware. Devices and courseware are utilized at the main training facility, Altus AFB, and at twelve (12) other bases in the CONUS and OCONUS area. Two are OCONUS, Kadena and Mildenhall.</p>
<p>The KC-135 ATS is a broadly scoped, active and dynamic performance based services program providing initial qualification and re-qualification KC-135 training to Pilots, Boom Operators and Instructors. Operation, maintenance and modifications of devices and maintenance of courseware, often driven by the mandate to maintain training concurrent with the aircraft, contribute to this dynamic. A very active operations tempo (large numbers of students) and impetus to move more training from the aircraft to the ATS/simulator under AFSO 21 initiatives also contributes challenges faced by this program.</p>
<p>Key objectives of the program include:<br />1. Initial, continuation, and requalification training for KC-135 aircrew. Aircrews include pilots, navigators, and boom operators. <br />2. Maintaining the training devices and courseware concurrent to the current KC-135 aircraft baseline. <br />3. Support other modifications as required via ECPs. <br />4. Provide facility management. <br />5. Provide Program Management including Systems Engineering, Quality Assurance, Data/Configuration Management, and ESOH management.</p>
<p>To meet objective for small business participation in Air Force Trainer programs, large businesses who expect to submit offers under this program must commit to expanded small business participation and will be evaluated as to the extent of participation of Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) firms. The KC-135 ATS Program is considering a Pass/Fail minimum of 15% of the contract value for Small Business subcontracting. Large business offerors submitting proposals under the 15% requirement will be ineligible for award. Offeror's shall propose a 3% minimum target for each of the following Small/Disadvantaged Business categories: Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business, Hubzone Small Business, Small Disadvantage Business and Women-Owned Small Business. The targets to be submitted are in accordance with FAR 52.219-24, and language from the RFP model contract, Section L will be incorporated into and become part of the eventual final contract. The successful offeror will be required to provide reports on SDB subcontractor participation in accordance with FAR clause 52.219-25 in Section I of the contract under Contract Data Reporting Line (CDRL) which will be referred to under the Contractor Performance Assessment Rating System (CPARS) in the regular management of contract performance.</p>
<p>If the offeror is other than a small business, the offeror's Small Business Subcontracting Plan submitted in accordance with FAR 52.219-9, or Comprehensive Subcontracting Plan submitted in accordance with DFARS 219.702, and Section L paragraph 6.3.5.2 shall also be evaluated to determine the extent to which the offeror identifies and commits to the participation of Small Businesses (SB), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), and Minority Institutions (MI) whether as joint venture members, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor. Failure to submit such a plan will render the offeror ineligible for award.</p>
<p>Any sources interested in and responding to this synopsis shall describe their qualifications in the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Current and past experience in managing broadly scoped comprehensive contractor logistics support for this or similar training systems, including Training Systems Support Centers (TSSC), central and remote (multiple) training sites, and classified training. Experience serving as Prime Integrator for large training programs of a scope similar to those described above.<br />2. Current relevant experience in designing, building, networking, integrating, operating and maintaining devices of similar complexity and its relevance to the subject acquisition. Particular emphasis on experience in designing, integrating, operating and maintaining training systems in a networked environment for connected and/or Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) is important. <br />3. Personnel experience/qualifications in the areas of Training Systems Device Engineering, modification management, and integration.<br />4. Personnel experience/qualifications in the areas of courseware Instructional System Design (ISD), modification, management and instruction.</p>
<p>Depending on responses received from potential sources, the Air Force will make decisions on how to proceed. This synopsis shall not be construed to commit the Air Force to any particular course of action. Only those with a Bona Fide interest in this requirement who can clearly demonstrate qualifications and are capable of supporting the requirements as described above should respond no later than 1600 hours, Mountain Time, 04 Dec 2008.</p>
<p>The point of contact for this requirement is the Contracting Officer, Lance S Hardman. Responses should be directed the following E-mail address: lance.hardman@hill.af.mil.<br />________________________________________</p>

<DESC>This project involves the construction of stream improvement features over approximately 2 miles of Red River.  The work includes instream habitat structure installation, channel relocation, earthwork, and revegetation.  Revegetation will consist of erosion control seeding and on-site transplants only.

The project is located on the Red River Ranger District, Nez Perce National Forest, Idaho County, Idaho.  Price estimate for the total project is between $250,000 and $500,000.  A formal pre-bid tour was held in the Fall of 2007.  The only significant change made since this time is the source location of the trees for the instream structures.  They will be harvested from a unit source located in Deadwood Creek.  Trees stockpiled near Orogrande will also be used.  No formal pre-bid tour is planned at this time.  Contractors interested in visiting the site may call Karen Ruklic at 208-983-5144 for assistance.  Site photos are also available upon request.  The solicitation will be issued during February or March of 2009 with implementation planned for the 2009-2010.

One construction contract will be awarded based on Technical Evaluation Factors and Price specified in the RFP.  Competitive Source Selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.  This procurement utilizes a “best value” source selection process to enable NARA to select from among high quality contractors for this procurement.  Past performance is considered with factors such as price in determining which contractor to select for the project. The tradeoff process is the method that will be used to evaluate price and other factors specified in the Solicitation, with the goals and objectives being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance, quality and pricing.  

The Technical Evaluation Factors are:  EXPERIENCE (20%). The offerer must demonstrate its experience as a Construction Contractor responsible for the construction of at least two (2) similar projects, within the past five (5) years.  Similar project is defined as a project that is comparable in nature, type and complexity to the project in this solicitation, and meets all three (3) of the following characteristic: (a) construction included new or replacement shoreline protection site work; (b) the project size was not less that 100 linear feet or the construction cost at award was not less than $500,000 dollars; c) Project was performed around an occupied building or site.

Technical evaluation factors when combined are equal to price.  The NAICS number is 238990 and the Small Business Size standard is $13.0 million.

COORDINATION
The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.  
SPECIALIZED SERVICES 
In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the DSC occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, DSC will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the Denver Service Center will continue to acquire such specialized services.   The DSC does not intend to allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on subconsultant's services.  
TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA
Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance:  
A)	Demonstrated ability and experience to work nationwide, including U. S. possessions and territories, in the type of projects required under this contract, particularly small projects, in various climatic regions (i.e.  high mountain, heavy snow areas, arid deserts and coastal, urban and remote areas); and specific past performance records on previous architect/engineering work performed for federal, state, and local government agencies, and private industry documenting the quality of the firm's work and the firm's history of meeting performance schedules and budgets.

The total fees for the basic year and all option years shall not exceed $2,500,000, with a guaranteed overall minimum of $50,000 ($10,000 per contract period/annual).  Projects will be negotiated and awarded under fixed priced task orders. The total of all task orders per contract period will not exceed $500,000 and no single task order shall exceed $300,000. BACKGROUND: The project task orders awarded under these contracts vary in complexity, scale, and objectives.  The properties are located within the National Park Service, Midwest Region units and National Historic Landmarks (NHLs). The Midwest Region contains over fifty individual parks, with over two thousand historic structures, over one thousand cultural landscapes, and over four hundred NHLs.  The Midwest Region of the NPS includes nationally significant historic sites associated with Indian cultures, the fur trade, the exploration and opening of the American West, Civil War and frontier battles, presidential homes, and important 20th century developments in business, society and civil rights.  Additionally there are parks of scenic and natural beauty which include historic structures in cultural landscapes of local significance.The NHLs in the Midwest Region represent a large cross-section of American history and design.  They are among the nation's most significant historic places, and while some are units within the National Park system, most are owned by other governmental agencies, non-profits, or private individuals.  The diverse NHLs include residences, farms, military, industrial and commercial complexes, designed and vernacular landscapes, monuments and cemeteries.  The sites represent the development of the Midwest and include not only vernacular designs but high style examples of French Colonial, Gothic, Queen Anne, Tudor, Classical Revival, Craftsman and Moderne.The scope of work includes research, documentation, and design projects (Title I Services) including, but not limited to physical investigation and materials testing, preparation of condition reports, cultural landscape and historic structure reports, treatment recommendations, schematic designs and cost estimates, value analysis, asbestos and lead paint analysis, and other architectural/engineering work; Title II Services including preparation of construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates and value engineering; and construction management (Title III Services) such as inspection/ observation, site visits, consultation, review of submittals and shop drawings, and preparation of operation and maintenance manuals and as-built drawings. Disciplines including:  historical landscape architecture; historical architecture; architectural history; soil, structural, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical engineering; environmental analysis; and certified value analysis.  Secondary support disciplines include materials and art conservation, surveying, historical research, horticulture of local and vintage plants, ecological restoration specialist, civil, environmental, and geotechnical engineering.  Design services for construction work performed in historic buildings, landscapes or sites will require continuous attention to and compliance with historic preservation guidelines.  All work will be guided by NPS policies and directives.  Historic resources often present unique and unusual conditions and the NPS encourages creativity in the development of preservation methods. Projects will require coordination with various review and planning entities.  Prospective firms shall demonstrate past experience with cultural landscapes and historic structures, archaic building and landscape materials and compatible contemporary design.  SELECTION CRITERIAThe following criteria in descending order of importance shall be used in the evaluation of the prospective firms: 1.Professional qualifications of the firm and staff proposed for satisfactory performance of desired services.  Evaluation will consider key personnel of the primary firm and consultants to be used in this contract in terms of a) professional registration; b) education, training, relevant experience; c) awards, professional activities, and longevity with the firm; d) other relevant certifications.  The availability of an adequate number of personnel in the key discipline shall be presented to ensure that the firm can meet the potential of working on multiple task orders; 2.The firm has substantial specialized experience and technical competence as prime contractor or as a consultant on historic preservation projects for the National Park Service or other public/government or non-profit agencies;3.Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.

These services are currently provided by incumbents SAIC and Eastern Research Group (ERG) under EPA contracts EP-W-04-046 and EP-W-04-047, respectively.  Notwithstanding the Government's option to exercise term extensions, the current contracts are scheduled to expire on September 30, 2009.
The resultant contract for the discussed requirement will contain a Limitation of Future Contracting (LOFC) clause; stipulating that:  During the life of the contract, and for a period of five (5) years after the completion of the contract, unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not enter into a contract:  (1) with owners or operators of facilities that may be impacted by enforcement and compliance activities performed under a Work Assignment, of the resulting contract, as regulated parties under the Clean Water Act (CWA); Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuary Act (MPRSA); Clean Air Act (CAA); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); Oil Pollution Act (OPA); Pollution Prevention Act (PPA); Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); Superfund Reauthorization and Amendments Act (SARA); Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); Federal Facility Compliance Act (FFCA); National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA); Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA); Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA); and Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act (Battery Act); or (2) to act as a consultant to any such regulated parties that may be impacted by enforcement and compliance activities performed under Work Assignment, of the resulting contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>A monitoring system essential to the ongoing research conducted in the proposed laboratory vivarium.<BR><BR>The proposed system completely automates the data monitoring and collection by logging continuous real-time readings for temperature, airflow, humidity, differential pressure, lighting, water flow and pressure, door security, and general vivarium security. This system has the ability to notify the vivarium staff of potential problems occurring in temperature, humidity, airflow, air pressure, and water supply, via phone/pager, then email. The proposed system allows for vivarium task management by viewing current operating instructions accuracy, functionality and training; records real-time animal and equipment management allowing the vivarium staff to monitor equipment and animal movements within the vivarium; incorporates a bulletin board function to allow access to digital database for videos and other documents for training; and has the ability to read and send messages to groups within the vivarium and can access other documents thru internet applications. The access to the digital database for all in the vivarium can not only give the vivarium staff  and building staff access to documents, but it will make it much easier for outside site visitors to see how the vivarium operates on a day-to-day schedule. This digital database will also allow new employees a source for training on operating procedures within the vivarium. The internet application is a critical function because this will give access to other research institutions and their operating procedures. With the tri-service aspect of this new research laboratory it is even more important we cross check and balance each other to fulfill the research needs of all services and abide by all the Federal and DOD regulations for the proper care and use of laboratory animals in the DOD. The bulletin board function allows for anyone to receive and send messages to the vivarium staff about specific real-time vivarium problems.<BR><BR>This system also has the ability to create the reports animal facility managers need to comply with local, city, state, Federal Regulations, and DOD regulations, including the Guide for the Care and Use Laboratory Animals.<BR><BR>An automated watering feature can be integrated into a facility as we continue with our planned upgrades in the future. This insures compatibility of the systems crucial to our research programs. Therefore, the proposed monitoring system is essential to allow seamless functioning between systems. It is also mandatory to insure continuity of the research being performed, particularly with ongoing experiments so there are no changes in the way we provide for the animals care and well-being.<BR><BR>

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS1.	Box 6 of the solicitation issue date indicates 10/16 but the bid was not issued until November 1st.  Can the offer due date be extended since we do not have quite 2 weeks to complete this bid?  Please see Amendment #1 that was posted this week.  The due date is Friday, November 28. 2.	Page 4, it states the invoice is due by the 5 day of the subsequent month.  Most other oxygen contracts require it by 10th day.  Is there any flexibility with this date?  We need to keep it at the 5th.  3.	Page 8 second paragraph under Schedule of Items, indicates the Plan of Service must be completed by the contractor's RCP; however the contract does not call for RC visits except in the state of North Dakota.  Please advise as we want to ensure we clearly understand the clinical requirements for assessments.  The wording is, "The Plan of Service (see Attachment A) must be developed by VA or the contractor's Respiratory Care Practitioner (RCP), in accordance with the Plan of Care and the appropriate clinical staff at each VA."  4.	Page 9, item A0002 the M or H system indicates this could be used for emergency backup.  Does this mean if the patient has an M or H as a backup we can bill for it? No 5.	Page 14, item A0012 is the portable liquid oxygen.  Can you confirm this item must be ordered in conjunction with item A0011 since the portable system needs the reservoir to work?  Yes 6.	The solicitation does not specifically state we must be Joint Commission accredited but it states we must meet the Joint Commission requirements.  Can you confirm the contractor can be Joint Commission accredited or have equivalent accreditation?  Yes 7.	Page 84, items 27 and 28 we are unclear on what the difference in these two items/visits.  Please advise.  Item 27 should be 4 months.  You will see an amendment for that change. 8.	Page 106 indicates you are using a 3rd party agent to work with vendors regarding electronic invoice submission, who is this vendor?  This is a credit card company, based on the fact that most of the invoices will be paid by credit card. 9.	Page 112 requires us to include resumes/licensure for key personnel.  Can you confirm that would be our location managers and respiratory clinicians or would our delivery drivers also need to be included?  Can we include these documents on a CD in our response since there will be many attachments?  We would just need those resumes/licensure for the location managers and clinicians.  In addition, we would need to know that the drivers have appropriate licenses. 10.	Travel concentrator and home fill system are listed as optional - does this mean it is optional for us to supply or optional for the VA's to use this line item.  This is option for the VA to exercise, as it's not the norm.11.	Humidity is included in the pricing - do we have to supply pre-filled humidity bottles or refillable?  Refillable12.	Page 73 states that contractor submitting offer must have a location in the area- we do not currently have locations but are able to offer a plan as to where we would place locations - I assume that this is acceptable - correct?  Correct.13.	Please clarify visit requirements -page 84 states all patients will be visited every 3 months and then in the next section it states we will visit beneficiaries at least every 4 months - please clarify visit schedule.  Both references should state 3 monthsan amendment will be forthcoming.

<a href="mailto:gloria.bailey1@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>Brief Summary:  The US Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Acquisition Center, Orlando, FL, is developing an acquisition strategy to award a multi-year Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) contract.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that the potential LVC-IA contractor will provide technical, management and professional engineering support services, for initiation, development, and delivery of increment 1 for the LVC-IA program.  Tasks associated with this effort will include but will not be limited to: development, testing, integration, installation, training, and documentation of LVC-IA to comply with the Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) listed in the LVC-IA Capabilities Development Document (CDD).<BR><BR>Requirement: The Army has a requirement to develop an architecture to link LVC components, creating a multi-echelon, Joint, training environment that embeds into and stimulates digital Battle Command Systems (BCS), providing the appropriate conditions for realistic training which will increase unit force effectiveness and readiness.  The LVC-IA must enable linkage of LVC and BCS components in a standard, repeatable, and persistent manor. LVC-IA will incorporate future systems and capabilities, including emerging technologies, facilitating a building block approach that integrates and updates the LVC training environment. <BR><BR>The Government anticipates an evolutionary acquisition of four increments of military utility for LVC-IA. LVC-IA increment 1 (LVC-IA 1)will provide a two-way network-centric linkage between model, simulations and instrumentation and Battle Command Systems (BCS) that supports collective and battle staff training and mission rehearsals for a Brigade Combat Team (BCT).  LVC-IA provides the interoperability and components to retrieve, collect, and exchange data in real time, enabling a realistic representation of a Common Operational Picture (COP), across the Full Spectrum of Conflict.  The goal of the LVC-IA 1 is to enable an Integrated Training Environment (ITE) that approximates the Operating Environment, providing the most realistic training and mission rehearsal capabilities for units, leaders, and staffs.  <BR><BR>The defined training systems to be incorporated into LVC-IA 1 are:   <BR><BR>Live domain: <BR>    Home station Instrumentation Training System (HITS)<BR><BR>Virtual domain:<BR>    Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT)<BR>    Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT)<BR>    Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT)<BR><BR>Constructive domain:<BR>    Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC)<BR>    One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF)<BR><BR>Battle Command Systems: <BR>    Global Command and Control System (GCCS)<BR>    Air and Missile Defense Workstations (AMDWS)<BR>    Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data Systems (AFATDS)<BR>    All Source Analysis System (ASAS)<BR>    Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS-A)<BR>    Battle Command Sustainment Support System BC Server - Battle Command Server(BCS3)<BR>    Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD)<BR>    Force XXI Battle Command, Brigade-and-Below (FBCB2)<BR>    Maneuver Control System (MCS)<BR>    Integrated System Control (ISYSCON)<BR>    Command Post of the Future (CPOF) <BR><BR>As LVC-IA is fielded, the infrastructure will need to evaluate and deficiencies reported to the Government for each fielding location. The LVC training infrastructure is the means for communicating, exchanging data, and networking for all of the training domains. The infrastructure includes installation foundational elements such as: facilities, power, communications networks (i.e. RF/Fiber), Training Support Systems (TSS), personnel & equipment, resources, and management structure & organization to perform net-centric battle command training.<BR><BR>Notice:  PEO STRI will be hosting an industry briefing on Live Virtual Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) on December 3, 2008.  The briefings will be presented at the Orange County Convention Center (OCCC), during the The Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation & Education Conference (I/ITSEC). Two sessions, 10:00am  11:00 am and 2:00pm  3:00pm EST, will occur in room 230D West (Army Service Room) 2, at the convention center. Please see their website at: www.occc.net for their event calendar, directions, parking, floor plans, etc.  <BR><BR>Seating for this event is limited.  Interested parties are required to reserve seating no later than 3:00pm on Monday, December 1, 2008. Reservations are limited to two seats per company.  Reservations may be made by email to Ms. Gloria Bailey at: gloria.bailey1@us.army.mil or via phone at 407-380-8508. Please provide your company name and address as well as the attendee(s) information to include: full name, title, email address and phone number.<BR><BR>Submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, or for the Government to pay for the information received. No solicitation document exists at this time. Questions concerning this posting should be submitted in writing to the POC listed above.  <BR><BR>This effort will eventually be competed under PEO STRIs Omnibus Contract (STOC II), an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract. Award of the STOC II contract is anticipated during Fiscal Year (FY) 2009. Information concerning STOC and other PEO STRI requirements may be found using the business opportunities link on the PEO STRI website: www.peostri.army.mil.<BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE NOTICE. The tracking number for this announcement is W912P8-09-SN-0004.  The NAICS code for this proposed acquisition is 237990. Federal Supply Code is Y299. Business size standard is $31 million. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - New Orleans District will hold a pre-solicitation conference on November 21, 2008, 10:00 a.m. at the Marriott Hotel, 3838 N. Causeway Boulevard, Metairie, Louisiana  70002.<BR>The Western Tie In will be constructed to connect the Lake Cataouatche Levee to the Mississippi River Levee, closing off the western end of the West Bank and Vicinity portion of the Greater New Orleans Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System. The project is located in the western portion of Jefferson Parish and the eastern portion of Saint Charles Parish on the West Bank of the Mississippi River. The selected alternative will reduce the risk of storm surge from a tropical event that has a one percent chance of occurring in any given year.<BR><BR>There are three alternatives under consideration for construction of the Western Tie In. The alternatives include a variety of combinations of navigation and drainage structures, earthen levees and floodwalls. Features common to each of the alternatives will be a crossing at Hwy 90 and 2 railroad floodgates. Work will include levee embankment, floodwall, and floodgate construction and items related thereto.<BR><BR>One of the alignments in particular would require special construction considerations. A significant portion of the levee construction for this alignment would occur inside of the Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion Project. In order to keep the Davis Pond Diversion in operation throughout construction, this levee construction would require construction of dewatering cells prior to levee construction. Work would also include construction of access bridges across the Outer Cataouatche Canal. The Corps would like to get industry feedback on design and construction methods for these dewatering cells. The preliminary design is based on construction of these cells with sand.

Authorized Workers Notice to Potential Bureau of Reclamation Contractors(a)	Definitions.  		IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service 		SSA - Social Security Administration		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
 	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
 	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site:http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm .
	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
 	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
 	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
 	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.

Offers are due no later than November 14, 2008.

An indefinite quantity contract is a contract pursuant to which the contractor will perform a series of individual projects at different Postal Service facilities. The quantities specified in this contract are not purchased until ordered. Delivery or performance must be as directed in work orders issued in accordance with the Work Order clause and the contract schedule.  The supplier must furnish to the Postal Service, when ordered, the services specified in this contract up to and including the quantity designated as the Total Contract Value.  There is no minimum order required under this contract. The contractor may be required to work on multiple Work Orders at different locations during the same time frame.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
(1) * Are, * are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) * Have, * have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and
(3) * Are, * are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) [ ] Outside the United States.
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]
(1) [ ] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that—

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

STATEMENT OF WORK:

1.	 INTRODUCTION

On November 1, 2008 one of three High Voltage feeders (13.8KV) that feeds a group of 9 buildings at the NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland campus experienced a short circuit fault.  The fault is located in the High Voltage manhole #30.  The faulted cable has been isolated and de-energized.  Two remaining feeders are still on line.  The high voltage cable is paper insulated, lead covered (PILC) cable.  This contract is for removal of the damaged 500kcmil “Y” splice, testing of all three feeders in the manhole, repair of the cable (PILC “Y” splice), and retesting of each of the three feeders in the repaired condition.  As an option, replacement of the affected feeder(s) may also be necessary.  This work may include replacement of the feeder between the fault and the nearest manhole to the North, or between the fault and the nearest manhole to the South.  The base contract includes work inside of the manhole only.  

There are three conductors for each feeder (one conductor per phase).  For existing PILC, three conductors per cable (3/C).  For replacement cable EPR, one conductor per cable (1/C).

The estimated dimensions per feet to the manhole to the South and North are:

To Manhole #31, north of manhole #30:  238 feet.
To Manhole #29, south of manhole #30: 541 feet.
To building 231 transformer in High Voltage room, east of manhole #30:  320 feet.
To building 301 transformer in High Voltage room, west of manhole #30:  450 feet.

For pricing and initial inspection only, ALL power to the affected manhole will be secured through the NIST networked distribution system.  During the repairs, it is assumed that the work will be done with one live feeder.  In coordination with the NIST High-Voltage shop, feeders may be switched and/or energized upon request.

The manhole was de-energized and inspected on Tuesday, November 4, 2008.  Any further inspection and repairs are to be performed under live conditions.  

The Government intends for repairs to be performed the weekend of November 22-23, 2008.  If the Government chooses to exercise Option #1 (EPR cabling), the awardee will be notified, in writing, immediately and have 7 business days to perform the requirements of Option #1.

<CONTACT>Kristin K Fuller, Phone 703-696-4591, Email fullerk@onr.navy.mil - Vera G Carroll, Branch Head ONR Code 253, Phone 703-696-2610, Email carrolv@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research is interested in receiving proposals for technologies that support the development of a mobile, high throughput networking infrastructure for Naval forces.  This effort is in response to the need for a mobile communications capability that can be used to supplement or to replace the current satellite infrastructure on which our Naval forces rely.  It is the intent of this capability that Naval forces be able to complete all tactical missions including platform-to-platform communications, ISR and reachback using this infrastructure either with or without the use of satellites.
The Airborne Communications Suite includes high throughput air-to-air communications links, wideband air-to-surface/surface-to-air communications links, and high throughput SATCOM links.  The high throughput air-to-air links are anticipated to be millimeter wave (MMW) links (above 19 GHz) using physical and link layer protocols that are to be defined within this effort.  The air-to-surface and surface-to air links are anticipated to be line-of-sight Ku band links that are capable of operating in the same bands as current Ku-band Tactical Common Data Links (TCDL), in adjacent or extended frequencies.  It is the intention that these links provide enhanced data rate and range performance over current TCDL, support networking of platforms, and employ nonproprietary waveforms that can either be high throughput, jam-resistant, or support low probability of detection.  Further, it is intended that the system supporting these new waveforms operating in Ku-band be able to revert to legacy TCDL (Ethernet over Generic Framing Protocol) at 10.7 Mbps and 45 Mbps.  For the air to air link compatibility with the Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) is also desirable.  New physical, link and network layer protocols proposed for use on these links may be recommended by the Navy for inclusion in next generation TCDL data link formats. 

The High Performance HF-UHF Communications Package is intended to improve performance of communications in frequencies below 2 GHz by the introduction of higher bandwidth transmissions, advanced modulation and coding techniques, jam resistance, improved networking techniques and protocols, and implementation of surrogate satellite capabilities.  Technologies developed may also be used to support higher throughput waveforms at frequencies above 2 GHz.  Products supporting this capability are used on aircraft as well as surface ships and ground nodes.  

Technologies of Interest

Systems Design and Integration.  The conceptual implementation shows wideband long range links at MMW as well as at Ku band. These links are envisioned to require fast switching directional antennas to support networking.  Ranges on the order of 200-500 nmi, depending on the aircraft altitude and type are needed.  Data rates supported are on the order of 10’s of Mbps to ~200 Mbps depending on range. Data rates, transmit power, waveforms, and error correction codes will be varied depending on link conditions and ranges, in order to improve reliability.  The system must support both voice and data and forwarding of information depending on data type and assigned precedence (which may vary with time).  Innovative ways to use the HF through UHF spectrum to increase bandwidth and improve interference resistance, considering legacy shipboard and airborne RF distribution systems, are desirable. 

The government will lead an IPT, which will include radio, RF and antenna manufacturers as well as government laboratories, to develop the design of the complete system and to ensure that components developed can be integrated effectively.

Apertures and Phased Arrays for Millimeter Wave, Ku band and SATCOM.  It is envisioned that links at both MMW and Ku band will be directional in nature to support long ranges, and will require fast switching to support networking.  Phased array apertures are the preferred solution for LOS links as they use electronic steering. SATCOM apertures are needed to support wideband links at ~10s of Mbps from airborne platforms to military satellite constellations such as Wideband Global Satellite (WGS).  SATCOM and LOS apertures for aircraft should present low surface expression relative to the skin of the aircraft and should be light weight.  Surface ship LOS apertures need to be large enough to support four simultaneous TCDL links at a receive data rate of 135 Mbps and a transmit data rate of 45 Mbps for ranges up to 150 nmi.  Cost considerations are important and low cost architectures and aperture designs that provide a low cost are required.  

UHF Surrogate Satellite Technologies.  New architectures, designs and RF technologies are needed for the development of low cost, low power, light weight transponders suitable for use as “surrogate satellite” devices for supporting Naval communications needs in the UHF band.  Designs should be compatible with both legacy Navy UHF airborne and shipboard systems, and should be expandable to support multiple narrowband and wideband (bandwidth TBD) UHF signals.  

Radio System Technologies for 2 GHz and above.  New modular software defined digital radio architectures and designs are needed to support link performance improvements using high throughput waveforms in all frequency bands. Commonality of basic hardware and software design for ship, air and ground platforms is required.  Software/firmware efforts will develop libraries of core modules openly available to government users that can be easily applied for new applications without the need to rewrite code.   Radios will be composed of separate analog RF modules and digital signal processing modules that connect with well defined open interfaces and may have varying processing capabilities.  As an example, conversion of signals to and from analog could be accomplished with individual “daughter” boards that attach to separate FPGA signal processing boards selected for a given bandwidth/processing speed and cost (e.g., low bandwidth-low speed/low cost, high bandwidth-higher speed/higher cost).  Hardware/software designs will have well defined open standard interfaces such as Gigabit Ethernet for data, control, and loading of software.   Processing and analog hardware will be easily upgradable as new components become available, minimizing the need to change the footprint and cabling on naval platforms. Communications security (for data) is provided external to the radio. Operation of hardware at data rates up to and including 135 Mbps is needed.  Consideration should be given to the government’s ability to use the devices produced for applications not related to communications, such as RADAR and Electronic Warfare.

Radio and System Software Modules.  Software modules are needed for use in programmable radio and system control software libraries.  Modules needed include but are not limited to:  1) Modulators and demodulators for modulations such as BPSK, QPSK, OQPSK, 8PSK, 16APSK, 16QAM, and other commonly used waveforms; 2) spread spectrum schemes; 3) carrier and timing recovery schemes; 4) Optimal combining schemes allowing coherent receive signal combining from two physically displaced apertures 5) error correction codes; 6) commonly used channel access schemes; 7) equalizers. Modulation at rates up to and including 135 Mbps is required.  Modules related to system operation, such as aperture control, and acquisition and tracking of nodes are also desired.  Radio modules will be written so that they can be implemented and evaluated in a MATLAB/SIMULINK environment.  Generation of functional code for use on FPGAs from these same MATLAB/SIMULINK models is required. Open designs that can be modified to suit the government’s future needs are needed.  Proprietary software designs must be fully documented to enable use with other open modules and will only be accepted at the government’s discretion.

Digital/RF Distribution Systems.  Shipboard communications systems and potentially airborne systems that will take advantage of coherent combining of signals from receiving apertures are of interest.  Signal processing is envisioned to take place below decks and will necessitate development of new digital/RF system architectures to preclude the need for routing RF signals throughout the ship. These new digital/RF shipboard signal distribution systems will permit the navy to take advantage of commercially available fiber optic transmission technologies. 

Low Cost Components. The Navy will consider the development of microwave components that are at a Technology Readiness Level of 3-4 and have the potential to be mass produced at low cost in order to facilitate the implementation of phased arrays in the bands of interest.  These components include but are not limited to:  low noise amplifiers, phase shifters, efficient power amplifiers and filters. Component developed under this will be available to all DOD users.  Additionally, the Navy will consider the development of custom ASICs that provide digital processing functions such as modulation, demodulation and error correction coding and can be easily employed to replace functions currently performed in FPGAs.  Any ASIC designed under such development would be required to be available to any qualified radio vendor for purchase. The objectives of an ASIC component development are to lower system cost and improve the commonality of signal processing techniques. 

Network Design.  The majority of network design at ISO/OSI Layers 2 and above will be accomplished within other ONR programs, but must be compatible with hardware and software developments in this effort in order to provide reliable performance in the presence of interference, or with intermittent connectivity. Developments of interest include but are not limited to definition of discovery mechanisms and pointing and tracking of other nodes in the system using multiple antennas.  Integration of these developments with radio, software/firmware, and aperture developments, as well as integration with networking developments at higher ISO/OSI Layers is essential.

Other Considerations

Low Cost Architectures and Designs. Although the primary consideration in this effort is implementation of a mobile interference resistant wireless networking infrastructure, low cost of acquisition and ownership are also critically important. As noted, the Navy is considering the development of key aperture and signal processing components with the intent of making these components available for developers in order to keep cost of acquisition low. Where possible and when available, developers should consider use of any modified COTS or GOTS in their developments as well as any design decisions that may allow reduction of production costs. Additionally, the use of systems and subsystems that are being manufactured in significant volumes for other DoD and non-DoD applications are of interest as a means to reduce acquisition costs to the Navy.

Open Architecture Designs. Consistent with the desire to reduce overall lifecycle costs while improving flexibility, development efforts undertaken as part of this BAA shall be open for use within the government.  As such, the Navy will generally require “Unlimited Rights” or “Government Purpose Rights” as defined by DFARS on all technical data and designs resulting from these development efforts.  Items covered will include technical descriptions of architectures, designs, component functionality and functioning, software and firmware and programming guides and toolkits, algorithms, simulations, interfaces and interface descriptions, and performance of components and of the system as a whole.  System components that have software, such as system or antenna controllers, complete documentation will be provided to the government describing how the items are to be programmed for interfacing with other major components.  For components that require significant low level programming, such as radios or signal processors, software development kits will need to be provided to permit the government to program all functions and to understand the expected performance.  Delivery of source code is mandatory for all software/firmware developments. 

Submission of proprietary designs of selected system level components is not encouraged. However, such designs may be accepted at the government’s discretion, provided that functionality, performance and interfaces are adequately defined to permit integration with other system level components, and that the acceptance of the designs is in the best interests of the government.

With regard to any restrictions on the conduct or outcome of work funded under this BAA, ONR will follow the guidance on and definition of "contracted fundamental research" as provided in the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) Memorandum of 26 June 2008. As defined therein; the definition of "contracted fundamental research", in a DoD contractual context, includes [research performed under] grants and contracts that are (a) funded by Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Budget Activity 1 (Basic Research), whether performed by universities or industry or (b) funded by Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) and performed on-campus at a university. Advanced technology development is funded through Budget Activity 3. In conformance with the USD(AT&L) guidance and National Security Decision Directive 189, ONR will place no restriction on the conduct or reporting of unclassified fundamental research, except as otherwise required by statue, regulation or Executive Order. Normally, fundamental research is awarded under grants with universities and under contracts with industry. Advanced technology development is normally awarded under contracts and may require restrictions during the conduct of the research and DoD pre-publication review of research results due to subject matter sensitivity.  Under this BAA most, if not all, of the research is anticipated to be advanced technology development and not contracted fundamental research.

BUY AMERICAN ACT/BALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROGRAM				EXHIBIT B

1.	BUY AMERICAN ACT – CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS  (FAR 52.225-9)(MAY 2002)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-- 
"Component" means any article, material, or supply incorporated directly into construction materials. 
"Construction material" means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a subcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction material. 
"Cost of components" means-- 
(1)	For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation 
costs to the place of incorporation into the construction material (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or 
(2)	For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of 
the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the end product. 
"Domestic construction material" means-- 
(1) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States; or 
(2) A construction material manufactured in the United States, if the cost of its components mined, 
produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which non-availability determinations have been made are treated as domestic. 
"Foreign construction material" means a construction material other than a domestic construction material. 
"United States" means the 50 States and the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other place subject to U.S. jurisdiction, but does not include leased bases. 
(b) Domestic preference. (1) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a - 10d) and the Balance of Payments Program by providing a preference for domestic construction material. The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause. 
(2) This requirement does not apply to the construction material or components listed by the Government as follows: _________________________________________________________________________________
[Contracting Officer to list applicable excepted materials or indicate "none"] 
(3) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause if the Government determines that-- 
(i)	The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable. The cost of a particular 
domestic construction material subject to the requirements of the Buy American Act is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 6 percent; 
(ii)	The application of the restriction of the Buy American Act to a particular construction material would be impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest; or 
(iii)	The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in 
sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality. 




										Exhibit B
										Page 2

 (c) Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American Act. (1)(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request, including-- 
	
(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials; 
(B) Unit of measure; 
(C) Quantity; 
(D) Price; 
(E) Time of delivery or availability; 
(F) Location of the construction project; 
(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and 
(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials cited in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause. 
(i)	A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed price comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause. 
(iii) The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and 
any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free certificate may be issued). 
(ii)	Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain 
why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination. 
(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American Act applies and the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the differential established in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American Act applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant with the Buy American Act or Balance of Payments Program. 
(d) Data. To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers.

2.	NOTICE OF BUY AMERICAN ACT – CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS (FAR 52.225-10) (MAY 2002)

(a) Definitions. "Construction material," "domestic construction material," and "foreign construction material," as used in this provision, are defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Buy American Act-Construction Materials" (Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.225-9). 
(b) Requests for determinations of inapplicability. An offeror requesting a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American Act should submit the request to the Contracting Officer in time to allow a determination before submission of offers. The offeror shall include the information and applicable supporting data required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 in the request. If an offeror has not requested a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American Act before submitting its offer, or has not received a response to a previous request, the offeror shall include the information and supporting data in the offer. 
(c) Evaluation of offers. (1) The Government will evaluate an offer requesting exception to the requirements of the Buy American Act, based on claimed unreasonable cost of domestic 
construction material, by adding to the offered price the appropriate percentage of the cost of such foreign construction material, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9. 



										EXHIBIT B
										Page 3

(2) If evaluation results in a tie between an offeror that requested the substitution of foreign construction material based on unreasonable cost and an offeror that did not request an exception, the Contracting Officer will award to the offeror that did not request an exception based on unreasonable cost. 
(d) Alternate offers. (1) When an offer includes foreign construction material not listed by the Government in this solicitation in paragraph (b)(2) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9, the offeror also may submit an alternate offer based on use of equivalent domestic construction material. 
(2) If an alternate offer is submitted, the offeror shall submit a separate Standard Form 1442 for the alternate offer, and a separate price comparison table prepared in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 for the offer that is based on the use of any foreign construction material for which the Government has not yet determined an exception applies. 
(3) If the Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 does not apply, the Government will evaluate only those offers based on use of the equivalent domestic construction material, and the offeror shall be required to furnish such domestic construction material. An offer based on use of the foreign construction material for which an exception was requested-- 
(i) Will be rejected as non-responsive if this acquisition is conducted by sealed bidding; or 
(ii) May be accepted if revised during negotiations.

Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity’s Chief of the Contracting Office.  Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an “Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979.”  (Note:  DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer’s decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer).  Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.

If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute.  Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.

(b)  Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party.  The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1).

STATEMENT OF WORK:

1.	 INTRODUCTION

On November 1, 2008 one of three High Voltage feeders (13.8KV) that feeds a group of 9 buildings at the NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland campus experienced a short circuit fault.  The fault is located in the High Voltage manhole #30.  The faulted cable has been isolated and de-energized.  Two remaining feeders are still on line.  The high voltage cable is paper insulated, lead covered (PILC) cable.  This contract is for removal of the damaged 500kcmil “Y” splice, testing of all three feeders in the manhole, repair of the cable (PILC “Y” splice), and retesting of each of the three feeders in the repaired condition.  As an option, replacement of the affected feeder(s) may also be necessary.  This work may include replacement of the feeder between the fault and the nearest manhole to the North, or between the fault and the nearest manhole to the South.  The base contract includes work inside of the manhole only.  

There are three conductors for each feeder (one conductor per phase).  For existing PILC, three conductors per cable (3/C).  For replacement cable EPR, one conductor per cable (1/C).

The estimated dimensions per feet to the manhole to the South and North are:

To Manhole #31, north of manhole #30:  238 feet.
To Manhole #29, south of manhole #30: 541 feet.
To building 231 transformer in High Voltage room, east of manhole #30:  320 feet.
To building 301 transformer in High Voltage room, west of manhole #30:  450 feet.

For pricing and initial inspection only, ALL power to the affected manhole will be secured through the NIST networked distribution system.  During the repairs, it is assumed that the work will be done with one live feeder.  In coordination with the NIST High-Voltage shop, feeders may be switched and/or energized upon request.

The manhole was de-energized and inspected on Tuesday, November 4, 2008.  Any further inspection and repairs are to be performed under live conditions.  

The Government intends for repairs to be performed the weekend of November 22-23, 2008.  If the Government chooses to exercise Option #1 (EPR cabling), the awardee will be notified, in writing, immediately and have 7 business days to perform the requirements of Option #1. 

Refer to the Specifications - section 16124 below for medium cable specification.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment #1 is to post questions and answers related to this procurement.

Question 1. Our company is interested to provide quotation for above mentioned procurement and would like to know whether customs tax fees would be applied for generators or they would be duty free when importing them into Kyrgyzstan. Please let us know so that we could prepare our offer accordingly.

Answer: USAID will arrange for duty and tax-free customs clearance at the port of entry.  Generators should be consigned to USAID/CDC, American Embassy, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.  

Question 2. Is there a facility in the city in which we can store the equipment as it staged for installation? If not, will we be able to bring in the equipment as needed in the order of installation?

Answer: USAID will not provide any facilities.  It is responsibilities of the contractor to arrange all necessary facilities/warehouse. 

Question 3. The solicitation states a “reasonable” number of units must be on hand in the country for replacement-what is the “reasonable” number expected for each size of generator?

Answer: The contractor should respond immediately to service requests in accordance with the warranty service requirements stated in the Attachment II.  It is our suggestion that 1-2 units for 16kW generators will be available any time.  For other size of generators of 5kW and 45kW it is not necessary to have completed units in the country. Some exchangeable spare parts will be OK.

Question 4. Will contractor need to provide all transportation while in country of will USAID facilitate?

Answer: It is responsibility of the contractor.  Freight costs should include the cost of local delivery from the port of entry to exact locations specified in Attachment I of the solicitation. 

Question 5. Will XXX’s past performance in supplying this type of equipment represent a satisfactory answer to the Past Performance requisite?

Answer: past performance information should be provided in the offer and include past performance references for the most recent and relevant contracts (5 are recommended) for efforts similar to this requirement..  USAID will consider it carefully while evaluation of offers. 

Question 6. How much time will be allocated to training?

Answer: the training should be conducted during the installation and commissioning of generators.  The contractor should plan accordingly.

Question 7. Will USAID facilitate billeting for Contractor personnel while in country providing this procured service?

Answer: The Contractor shall be responsible for furnishing all logistic support in Kyrgyzstan.

Question 8.  Are you set up with installation in Kyrgyzstan? If we can fulfill the complete shipment of generators to Kyrgyzstan is that sufficient, or does this have to be supply all equipment and a team to install them?

Answer: The Contractor shall be responsible for delivery of generators, their installations and conducting the training for staff.

<DESC>Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Puget Sound is seeking qualified sources for a follow on contract(s) to provide comprehensive services in the areas of naval architecture, civil, mechanical, electrical, electronics, industrial, and environmental engineering.  The work will include planning and estimating, engineering designs and calculations, technical research, material specifications, ordering and kitting, troubleshooting and failure mode analysis, assessments and inspections, testing, grooming and alignment of equipment, work control, testing and test direction, logistics support, oversight and management of industrial work, training, and detailed reports based on engineering studies and analysis relating to marine vessels and equipment (including but not limited to cranes, caissons and similar equipment used to support ship repairs, overhaul and dismantling).  This may also include Computer Aided Design (CAD) drafting and modeling, computer programming and suppor! t services, and technical document preparation, publication and reproduction.  The work may also include the need to install and monitor test and troubleshooting equipment and minor installation/repair/replacement of components, equipment, and systems associated with troubleshooting and various assessments and inspections.  It should be recognized that the major focus of this contract is on marine vessels and equipment but that it also provides the flexibility to include occasional tasking involving Civil Engineering (facilities) disciplines.  The Government recognizes that because of the anticipated infrequent nature of these facilities-type tasks, the prime contractor(s) need not have "in-house" expertise but should have access to the means for accomplishing these types of tasks.   Performance is primarily expected to be in Kitsap County, WA and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard.  Other areas of performance include the San Diego, Ca. area, the Norfolk, VA. region, Jacksonville,!  FL., Kings Point, GA., Ingleside, Tx., Guam, Japan, Italy and the Persian Gulf.  The expected contract award date is on or about 1 December 2009.
