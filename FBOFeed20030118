The location of the work is primarily at Naval Air Facility, Key West Florida and other Federal Government locations within the Florida Keys and Key West.  However, work may also be required at other Federal Government areas within the area of responsibility of South Florida extending approximately in a horizontal line from Ft. Myers, Florida to West Palm Beach, Florida, and areas south to and including Key West, Florida.  The Government intends to set aside one contract to a certified 8(a) contractor, one to a Small Business contractor, with the other contract award unrestricted.  To receive award, all contractors must be technically qualified in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation, including satisfactory past performance.  The successful contractors will compete with each other for Task Orders under the terms of the contract.  Task Orders will be awarded based on Best Value or Low Price Technically Acceptable Proposal.  The value of each Task Order will be in the range of $2,000 to $100,000.  There is no limit on the number of Task Orders one contractor may receive.  However, the minimum guaranteed amount to bind each contract is $10,000 (ten thousand dollars).  The government intends to issue each contract for a base year with four option years.  The total maximum amount, including base year and option years, cumulative including all contracts, is $10,000,000 (ten million dollars).  Work will involve a variety of construction and service type requirements, which are generally, repair, maintenance, or services related to existing Federal Government facilities within the area of responsibility.  Construction requirements may include, but not be limited to, roofing, concrete, masonry, mechanical work, electrical work, facility or office renovation or rehab, paving, painting, fencing, and civil work.  Service requirements may include, but not be limited to, landscaping, debris removal and disposal, signs and lettering, pump-out of lift stations, septic tanks or grease traps, surveys, soil borings, removal of contaminated soil, oil, or other hazardous material abatement, interior or exterior cleaning of housing units, concrete pumping, inspection and cleaning of chimneys, hoods, or vents, bulk piping system pressure leak testing, invasive exotic plant removal.  It is expected and anticipated that awarded contractors will subcontract portions of the work or services as necessity dictates.  The Small Business size standard is $28.5 million.  NAICS Codes include the following 2-digit categories:  23, 33, 54, 56.  Personal services will not be ordered under this solicitation.  Interested parties are encouraged and invited to inquire at any time by telephone or e-mail.  The solicitation date is not yet established, but award is expected by September 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is NWWG953039999 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC2001-11).  The contract will be a firm-fixed price per day charge purchase order.  Quoted estimates are to be itemized on a per day basis and shall identify estimated transit times, boat rental fees (if applicable), and all other charges necessary to complete the trip.
NDBC is discontinuing a 10-meter buoy station and intends to place the 10-meter buoy in storage.  NDBC is seeking to contract a vessel to tow NDBC buoy 10D06 from the DB Sampson mooring in Santa Barbara, CA to the MARAD storage facility in Suisun Bay, CA.  The buoy to be towed is 10m (33ft) in diameter with a hull depth of 1.98m (6.5ft).  The buoy displaces 62,300 kg (115,00lbs), of which approximately 48 percent is water ballast. The buoy is constructed of low carbon steel, with an aluminum sensor level of 10 m (32.8 ft) above the deck.  The buoy draft is 3.2 feet.  The buoy is expected to be ready for towing on or around the last week of February 2003.
Prior to towing the buoy, NDBC/SAIC contractor personnel will ballast the buoy for deployment.  This is done by transferring the ballast until 38" is from the freeboard to the deck edge.  NDBC personnel will verify the operation of the O&I light, and securing all doors, hatches, scuttles, and tank covers.
A single point tow from the reinforced deck pad eye at the designated bow is recommended.  Note: the only fitting on the buoy capable of sustaining the towing loads are the heavy outboard pad eyes.  To rig a towing bridle from these pad eyes is not recommended, as the resulting bridle angle is too great to be effective.  NDBC discus buoys have been towed at speeds from 6 to 10 knots, with towing hawser lengths of 400 to 1,800 feet.  Depending on weather and sea conditions, the best speeds are attained on longer hawsers.  In adverse weather conditions, speeds must be reduced to keep the buoy?s deck from becoming awash.
The vessel is responsible for supplying all towing equipment.  In addition the Captain, crew and vessel must be Coast Guard licensed.  Proof of vessel insurance must be provided prior to awarding contract.  Comfortable quarters and mess facilities for up to three NDBC and/or SAIC contractor technicians must be provided.  Prior to the commencing operation, the technicians will conduct a meeting with all vessel personnel to assure that everyone understands the details of the operations and what each must do to assure a safe and successful mission.  Disagreements with NDBC operational procedures will be settled prior to commencement of the trip.  Inability to settle the disagreements to the satisfaction of NDBC, especially if it is felt that failure to follow the NDBC procedures may result in personnel injury or damage/loss of the buoy, will result in cancellation of the contract.  There are maximum sea states in which the vessel would be expected to operate.  The decision whether to go or no-go when considering weather conditions will be made by mutual agreement between the NDBC representative and the boat Captain, with the Captain having the final authority to postpone, cancel, or delay a mission.  Due consideration will be given to the safety of the vessel and personnel aboard at all times.  A no-go decision because of weather will not be considered a cancellation of the contract.  
Proof of adequate liability insurance must be provided with bid submission.

<DESC>THE SUBJECT SOLICITATION IS TEMPORARILY POSTPONED UNTIL FY03.

The Federal Government intends to award up to three Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for Minor Construction and Services.  The location of the work is primarily at Naval Air Facility, Key West Florida and other Federal Government locations within the Florida Keys and Key West.  However, work may also be required at other Federal Government areas within the area of responsibility of South Florida extending approximately in a horizontal line from Ft. Myers, Florida to West Palm Beach, Florida, and areas south to and including Key West, Florida.  The Government intends to set aside one contract to a certified 8(a) contractor, one to a Small Business contractor, with the other contract award unrestricted.  To receive award, all contractors must be technically qualified in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation, including satisfactory past performance.  The successful contractors will compete with each other for Task Orders under the terms of the contract.  Task Orders will be awarded based on Best Value or Low Price Technically Acceptable Proposal.  The value of each Task Order will be in the range of $2,000 to $100,000.  There is no limit on the number of Task Orders one contractor may receive.  However, the minimum guaranteed amount to bind each contract is $10,000 (ten thousand dollars).  The government intends to issue each contract for a base year with four option years.

THE PROJECT SOLICITATION WILL CONSIST OF TWO PHASES. This announcement for prequalification is Phase I. The Department of State will evaluate and rate the prequalification proposals based on the evaluation criteria set forth in the following Evaluation Factors.  Those offerors receiving a satisfactory evaluated rating from the technical board will be issued a formal solicitation and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II.  If more than six satisfactory Phase I packages are received for any one project, the Government reserves the right to limit Phase II to the six best qualified offerors.  The submissions received in response to the Phase II formal solicitation shall be submitted in the formats provided and will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation procedures contained in the solicitation.  Due to time constraints, it is anticipated that the pre-qualified firms will be required to participate in visits to the project sites within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the design/build RFP. To offset some of the cost of the site visits and other related costs, pre-qualified firms that do not receive the design/build award will be paid $25,000 for each responsive project proposal they submit in Phase Two.... 

FIRMS THAT SUBMITTED A PREQUALIFICATION PACKAGE for design/build projects of similar scope and value during FY 2002 and were successfully pre-qualified by the OBO technical panel need not resubmit their pre-qualification package under this announcement. If interested, the previously pre-qualified offerors must send the POC a letter of interest prior to the closure date of this solicitation.  The letter must indicate they are requesting pre-qualification and for which projects prequalification is sought. However, if any changes have occurred in a company s structure, size status, or Design Build Team since the submission of the original design/build pre-qualification package the offeror must identify the change(s) in the letter for the government to review and evaluate. The government will determine if such changes are acceptable. Offerors must ensure that they cite the RFP number of the previous pre-qualification solicitation and what specific changes were made since pre-qualification. A change by the contractor must be sent for evaluation to this office regardless of how minor the offeror may believe it is. If no changes have occurred since pre-qualification the offeror must state this in the letter of interest. Offerors are reminded that the letter of interest is due prior to the closure time and date of this solicitation otherwise the offeror will not be evaluated for pre-qualification for these projects....
