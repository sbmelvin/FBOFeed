<DESC>The Mid-Pacific Region of the Bureau of Reclamation is conducting a market survey in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.001 to obtain feedback from industry regarding the general requirements for an upcoming procurement.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool to determine potential sources and interested parties in the intended procurement pit tags and multiplexing and handheld readers for fisheries investigations.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized and posted at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.
Furthermore, this procurement is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns; however, ALL interested parties are requested to respond.  If adequate interest or sufficient supporting documentation is not received from HUBZone concerns, the solicitation may be issued as a small business set-aside or unrestricted basis without further notice or may be canceled.  Therefore, replies are requested from ALL interested parties, regardless of business size or category.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this synopsis not later than October 14, 2008, 2:00 PM PST.  Please submit all requested documentation listed below to Madeline C.

In addition, Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102 and 4.1201, apply to this procurement.

Also, please include attachments cataloging the company's equipment assets, personnel resources and financial resources that demonstrate company responsibility and capability to perform the required work.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for the maintenance and repair of 12 Precise Power Roesel Motor Generators (RMG), previously installed at all 12 FAA NEXRAD sites to enhance the NEXRAD system availability.  These sites are in rugged, remote locations in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico with difficult power supply conditions.  Precise Power is the original equipment manufacturer of the product, and possesses the special tooling equipment and proprietary data.  The FAA does not have the financial capability to develop specifications and drawings that will meet the FAA's requirement, allowing any other source to produce and insure comparability with existing equipment.  Precise Power is the only known source to meet this requirement.  Concerns having an interest in this requirement must have data rights to use the OEM's specifications and drawings.
Please include (Precise Power - RMG) for any responses to this survey.  Any questions must be submitted in writing and emailed to christopher.ekadis@faa.gov, prior to October 10, 2008.

Following the IDE approval, the contractors will provide regulatory, technical, and clinical support for the investigational device during the clinical study. 

Devices eligible for consideration in the PumpKIN program are limited to investigational devices that are appropriately designed and can provide suitable circulatory support for neonates, infants, and small children (<25 kg) with congenital and acquired cardiovascular disease who experience cardiopulmonary failure and circulatory collapse. Eligible devices should be designed and developed to address the unique clinical performance issues which are relevant to this patient population. Any eligible device should be substantially developed and should have undergone and successfully demonstrated reasonable performance in a relevant animal study.

This acquisition has not been designated a type of set aside, this information will be available upon solicitation posting. It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made for a period of 4 years. THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IS NOT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP); the Request For Proposals will be available on or about October 18, 2008.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking a contractor to provide a resource of preclinical and non-clinical services to advance the development of Topical microbicides (TM) and biomedical prevention (BP).  There is a critical need to promote discovery and transition of new strategies into clinical trials.  This NIAID-sponsored contract focuses on promoting the development of strategies containing TM/BP as a means to address the NIAID and Division of AIDS (DAIDS) priority of controlling and preventing the HIV/AIDS epidemic worldwide.  This contract will provide pre-clinical and non-clinical development services of TM/BP products essential for advancement to clinical testing and for supporting activities required for IND and NDE applications to the FDA.  TM/BP products for development services will be provided by or through the Project Officer and will be identified through NIAID-funded grants and contracts, the private sector, or other sources.  The specific services required will depend on the status of the individual candidate(s), the need to prioritize potential candidates, and an overall product development plan and/or regulatory submission plan to the FDA.  The scope of pre-clinical and non-clinical services to be provided include: (1) Individual gap-filling services on a case-by-case basis, to advance TM/BP products in the development pathway toward clinical assessment; (2) Comprehensive services for selected TM/BP products through a Go/No-Go milestone-driven pathway to accelerate a product toward clinical testing in the most efficient manner; and (3) Support for Best Practices Working Groups (BPWGs) composed of non-contract investigators to assess the critical processes and assays used to compare and advance products to clinical studies.  This activity will ultimately lead to identification and validation of surrogate biomarkers for safety and efficacy testing in clinical trials.  The Government anticipates the potential need to exercise options for additional BPWGs during the life of the contract.  It is estimated that up to four options for a total of 4 BPWGs will be exercised at the discretion of the Government during the period of the contract.  These options may be exercised during contract years 2-7.  The NIAID reserves the right to exercise more than one option per year, however, the total number of options will not exceed four during the 7-year period of the contract.  The NAICS code is 541 & 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  This RFP will be available electronically on/about September 9, 2008, and may be accessed through the Federal Business Opportunities at https://www.fbo.gov and the NIAID Office of Acquisition (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.

<DESC>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to solicit proposals to recompete its contract for a Biological Testing Facility through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541712.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about,  4/16/2009.   

 The contractor will perform assays on hundreds of submissions annually for classical endocrine and anti-fertility activity and establish potency ratios (in terms of standards) for those that exhibit significant effects. The contractor will also develop methods for determining the duration of biological activity following oral, subcutaneous and topical (transdermal, transvaginal, etc) administration and to evaluate the potential clinical utility of new compositions of matter and formulations.

 The contractor will be required to perform a wide range of screens, assays, safety tests and analytical procedures for the evaluation of new compounds, formulations and delivery systems. In addition, this project will also require the following:

1. Work conducted in a BSL2 facility.

2. An AAALAC-accredited animal facility. 

3.  Toxicology studies, including acute, subacute, subchronic, chronic, reproductive and genetic, may be undertaken in-house or through subcontracts.

4.  Rabbit vaginal irritation testing for the evaluation of formulations of spermicides and microbicides to include both gross and histopathological examination of external genitalia and cervix. Services of a board certified pathologist are required for performance of both gross and microscopic examinations. This test is usually performed under "Good Laboratory Practices" (GLP) Guidelines so that, if necessary, the results may be submitted to the FDA in support of a Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Drug (IND) initiation of clinical investigations. New compounds and/ or formulations must have an IND before clinical work can proceed.

5.  Contraceptive efficacy tests required to predict clinical activity of potential contraceptives. Dose-response and time related efficacy curves must be provided for comparison with various standards.

6.  Growth and maintenance of cell cultures for the conduct of in vitro assays required for evaluation of compounds. Theses assays include, but are not limited to, transfection of specific cell lines with estrogen and progesterone receptor expression plasmids and appropriate reporter constructs. These in vitro tests will permit a more thorough exploration of tissue-specific effects of a number of steroids, their antagonists, and other compounds exhibiting antifertility activities. 

The RFP will be available electronically on or about October 17, 2008 and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division has a requirement to support the Chief of Naval Aviation Trainings (CNATRA) TC-12B (Navy configured Raytheon/Beechcraft King Air BE-200) pilot training program.  The following individual pilot training courses are required: The Chief of Naval Aviation Training (CNATRA) requires the following individual pilot training courses: Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training (see CNATRAINST 1542.147); Multi-Engine Flight Instructor and Transition Training (see CNATRAINST 1542.153); Intermediate Tiltrotor TC-12B Flight Training (see CNATRAINST 1542.145). Additional requirements include conducting Flight Checks, VIP/Winging Events and additional Simulator training as required. The purpose of the Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training is to develop multi-engine flight skills while emphasizing instrument flying and crew coordination. At the successful completion of this training the flight student will be designated a naval aviator or USAF pilot qualified in multi-engine aircraft, and will have earned a standard instrument rating. The purpose of the Multi-Engine Flight Instructor and Transition Training is to provide designated aviators with appropriate flight procedures, instructional methodologies and techniques to instruct undergraduate flight students in the Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS and Intermediate E-2/C-2 phases of flight training. The Transition Training will prepare designated pilots with dissimilar flying experience for Naval Test Pilot School or for duty with a Maritime Patrol Fleet Replacement Squadron.  The above listed Multi-Engine Flight Instructor and Transition Training can also be performed in three separate and distinct training blocks as follows: a)  Copilot MPTS Training - the first block of Multi-Engine Flight Instructor Training, consists of the systems course as well as the first five CPT events; b)  Aircraft Commander Upgrade Training -  the second block of Transition Training, consists of two  basic instrument and three radio instrument simulator events; c)  Flight Instructor Upgrade Training - the third and final block of transition training.  The purpose of the Intermediate Tiltrotor TC-12B Flight Training is to develop multi-engine flight skills while emphasizing instrument flying and crew coordination.  At the successful completion of this phase of aviation training, the student will enter Advanced MV-22 helicopter training. Flight Checks are required for flight instructors and winged aviators and are flown as recurrent training.  Training is a single, 1.5-hour simulator event flown for proficiency.  VIP/Winging Events are special events that are public relations in nature.  These events are in direct support of Student Winging days and take place approximately every three weeks on average.  Additional simulator time will be used in support of student training as required.  CNATRA currently provides in-house TC-12B pilot training through various sources, including both government and contractor personnel and equipment. The contractor will be required to provide: all certified instructors, two TC-12B Flight Training Devices (FTD), support personnel required to operate and maintain the devices and any additional labor required for supervising and administering classroom and simulator training; and data rights for any contractor specific materials for this contracted training. The government will provide: facilities to support two TC-12B FTDs and associated contract personnel, all required course curricula/syllabi, and any additional government specific courseware/materials needed for the training of TC-12B pilots. These TC-12B training courses require both classroom academic and practical training using two TC-12B FTDs.  The FTDs required shall simulate the performance and functional operation of the TC-12B aircraft and shall minimally meet FAA Level 6 FTD certification requirements as defined under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-45A (FAA certification is not required).  In addition, the FTDs shall provide a freeze and reset capability and a minimum of a three-channel visual system capable of projecting a minimum 200-degree horizontal by a 40-degree vertical field of view and simulate VMC, IMC, day, and night conditions.  The contractor shall provide training in Building 1824 at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas.  The contractor shall use the government-furnished facilities and course syllabi in conducting all classroom and simulator training.  All instructors shall; have a minimum of 1,000 flight hours, have knowledge of  DoD rules and regulations governing aircraft operations, and be either a prior military pilot or possess an FAA flight instructor certificate with an instrument rating.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and under the authority of FAR 13.1, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Thisannouncement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued under Request for Quote RFQ-DC-09-00006 and includes incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541620 with a Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of 500 employees. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD), ENERGY STAR? Residential Branch requests that you submit a project plan and budget estimate for the award of a Purchase Order for "THE ENERGY STAR Multi-Family, High-Rise (MFHR) Program." STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW):  The estimated period of performance for this project is from date of award (approx Nov. 1, 2008) thru Oct 31, 2013 (including all options). Purpose: The mission of the Environmental Protection Agency's Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. CPPD forges partnerships with private and public organizations to accomplish this goal through the promotion of cost-effective energy-efficient technologies. CPPD delivers the technical information and tools that organizations and consumers need to choose energy efficient solutions and best management practices. ENERGY STAR is a one of CPPD's voluntary partnership programs. ENERGY STAR promotes energy efficiency in products, homes, and buildings in an effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through its effective use of the ENERGY STAR label. When placed on products, homes, and buildings the label signifies superior energy efficiency. Beyond the label, ENERGY STAR strives to improve energy performance in buildings and existing homes that may never achieve the label, but can still realize considerable energy savings. The ENERGY STAR label has been jointly managed by EPA and Department of Energy (DOE) since 1996. EPA is implementing a program to label multi-family high-rise that addresses the needs of the multifamily sector and works to improve the energy efficiency, health, safety, and security of all residential buildings with four (4) or more floors. As an initial step, EPA has embarked on a set of pilot programs to understand the unique issues related to labeling multi-family, high rise buildings. The purpose of this project is to assist EPA in conducting these pilots and to help launch a national ENERGY STAR multi-family, high rise program. Background: Multi-family, high-rise buildings present a unique set of challenges to EPA that are not found in either the ENERGY STAR New Homes or Commercial Buildings Programs. These challenges have made it difficult to adapt existing program approaches and procedures to this sector. First, much of this sector faces the split incentive issue where building owners are responsible for energy efficiency improvements but do not receive the benefit of lower utility bills. While the building owners may advertise their units as energy efficient, owners do not realize the financial benefits of energy efficiency. Without the payback of reduced energy bills, building owners are less likely to invest in energy efficiency. Second, tenant turnover in multi-family residences is extremely high, approaching 50% a year for some building owners. This high turnover rate makes it difficult to educate tenants on practices that reduce energy consumption throughout the building. Yet, occupant behavior and building management is a major factor in energy consumption of buildings. In addition, current residential modeling tools do not readily estimate the energy consumption of multi-family, high-rise buildings. The modeling problems are exacerbated in taller buildings. Finally, there is very little publicly available energy consumption data to develop a benchmark for this building type as is typically done in the ENERGY STAR Building Program. Building experts reviewing this data have commented on its poor quality. To investigate these concerns and help develop a possible ENERGY STAR multi-family high rise program, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the Consortium for Energy Efficiency (CEE), and interested states formed the National Working Group. The purpose of the National Working Group was to help EPA define elements of a possible ENERGY STAR for Multi-Family High Rise Program, and address several important barriers to the development of this program. In 2006, EPA approved a limited pilot program for the states of New York, Wisconsin and Oregon based on the work to date by the National Working Group. Under these pilots, newly constructed buildings that are 20% more energy efficient than a building constructed to ASHRAE 90.1.specifications, and are modeled to equal or exceed a score of 75 on RECS benchmark tool can be labeled as ENERGY STAR for a limited set of buildings. The National Working Group produced the following documents to assist projects in evaluating whether multi-family, high-rise buildings met these requirements: Incremental Cost Guidelines - This document contains the methodology for calculating the estimated incremental hard costs associated with the energy efficiency recommendations. Minimum Performance Standards (MPS) - The Minimum Performance Standards serve to restrict the ability of the energy consultant and design team to make performance trade-offs in the modeling and design of an energy efficient building in order to achieve an ENERGY STAR label. The specified components listed in the document must at least meet the indicated performance requirements. Multi-Family ENERGY STAR RECS Benchmarking Tool - The benchmarking tool quantifies the projected performance of a user defined multi-family building. A score of 75 or greater denotes performance among the nation's top 25%. Simulation Guidelines - This document contains the methodology for calculating the performance rating for Multi-family, high-rise buildings. It should be used by energy consultants to calculate a performance rating for the proposed building design. System Performance Testing Protocols - System Performance Testing Protocols are a set of requirements for verifying the installed performance of a building. The document outlines testing protocols, performance specification criteria, documentation requirements, and sampling protocols for assuring quality assurance. As a starting point for developing the most effective approach to a nationwide multi-family, high-rise buildings program, EPA is currently piloting the multi-family, high-rise buildings program using the guidelines and documentation established by the National Working Group.  Purpose and Goals of the Multi-family, high-rise buildings Pilot: The intent of this pilot is study the possibility of leveraging the ENERGY STAR mark to reduce energy use in the multi-family, high-rise buildings sector. EPA will evaluate information obtained from the pilot to understand how and whether these goals are achievable at the national level. These pilots will provide useful information concerning regional factors that address energy efficiency issues in the multi-family, high-rise buildings sector. By working with our partners, EPA hopes to collect regionally specific information to determine whether ENERGY STAR can effectively serve the market to promote energy efficiency. The following are criteria that EPA will apply to determine whether to expand ENERGY STAR beyond the pilot project stage for the multi-family, high rise sector.  ENERGY STAR is cost-effective - ENERGY STAR performance specifications must be cost effective. The additional cost of the energy efficiency improvements must be outweighed by the annual energy savings. While developers may construct a building to their own specifications to meet the ENERGY STAR requirements, EPA must understand that there are cost-effective options to achieve the ENERGY STAR specification.  ENERGY STAR represents real reductions in energy consumption - ENERGY STAR must represent true energy savings over standard construction. While the specification may be demonstrated through a modeling approach, ultimately, true energy savings must accrue to consumers. EPA works to demonstrate this link and value. ENERGY STAR provides value in the market for multi-family, high-rise buildings stakeholders - ENERGY STAR must be a mark of distinction in the market place and is valued by building owners and tenants.  ENERGY STAR offers a process for achieving performance targets that is feasible and easy to Implement - One of the main tenets of ENERGY STAR is that its programs are easy to implement and understand. EPA will examine the quality and consistency of the energy modeling across the various pilots. In addition, EPA will examine verification protocols and the necessary qualifications for quality control inspectors.  TASKS: The contractor will assist EPA in developing and maintaining the ENERGY STAR Multi-Family High-Rise Program by completing the following tasks:  Task 1:  Review the adaptation of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G Modeling Guidelines by the Ad Hoc Working Group in the Simulation Guidelines. The contractor shall assist EPA to complete the definition of the reference building and a proposed design, using the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G Guidelines. The contractor shall examine the Simulation Guidelines developed by the ad-hoc multi-family working group. With these guidelines, the contractor shall identify areas that may require additional research as well as propose possible default inputs that may be used to define the reference building. In adapting Appendix G to residential structures, the contractor shall anticipate the various building configurations posed by multi-family high rise. Deliverable:  Memo to TOPO outlining the current status of the Simulation Guidelines and its applicability to various building types and climates, and recommendations for possible research to complete the guidelines.  Due Date: To be determined by Technical directive once the contractor and TOPO have reviewed the guidelines to better understand the level of effort.  Task 2: 	Complete necessary analysis and research to complete any gaps in the Simulation Guidelines identified in Task 1. Through technical direction from the TOPO, the contractor shall perform analysis and research needed to complete the Simulation Guidelines for national use. The memo developed under Task 1 shall serve as the basis to identify these tasks. The contractor's analysis shall include input from regional stakeholders most familiar with the climate and building types. (For the purpose of estimating level of effort for this task, the contractor shall assume three research efforts during the period of performance. Each shall require 50 hours of contractor time to complete.) Deliverable:  To be determined by Technical Directive.  Task 3: Program Specifications. The contractor shall assist EPA in assessing the appropriate specification for the ENERGY STAR Multi-Family High-Rise program. Currently, the pilot specification requires a newly constructed building to be 20% more energy efficient than a building constructed to ASHRAE 90.1.specifications (2004), and modeled to equal or exceed a score of 75 on RECS benchmark tool. The contractor shall assist EPA: 1) Determine whether the current specification is cost-effective within the pilot programs as well as in other parts of the country, based on information received from the pilot programs. 2) Identify cost effective energy reduction measures for the 8 climate zones found within the United States to achieve the ENERGY STAR specification required in the pilot program,, for the various multi-family, high-rise building types. 3) Recommend required energy efficiency measures that should be incorporated in all multi-family, high-rise buildings to optimize performance. (For the purpose of estimating level of effort, the contractor shall focus on 2 climate zones with no more than three different building types in each climate zone) Deliverable:  To be determined by Technical Directive. Task 4:  Verification Procedures; System Performance Testing Protocols are a set of requirements for verifying the installed performance of a building. The National Working Group document outlines testing protocols, performance specification criteria, documentation requirements, and sampling protocols for assuring quality assurance. The contractor shall review the System Performance Testing Protocols developed by the National Working Group and identify the relative costs, value and difficulty of each of the requirements. In addition, the contractor shall identify any additional verification steps that may be appropriate to verify the energy efficiency of the multi-family high-rise. The contractor shall assess the cost and value of this omitted verification step to allow EPA to make an informed decision as to whether to include this additional verification step. In addition, the contractor shall assess the necessary qualifications required of personnel who may serve as verifiers under the ENERGY STAR Multi-Family, High-Rise Program. The contractor shall also review the existing certification and accreditation organizations to determine whether their current certifications may serve to qualify technicians as capable of verifying the energy efficiency improvements. (For the purpose of estimating level of effort for this task, the contractor shall assess the costs and value of the various System Performance Testing Protocol procedures, identify possible missing procedure and list possible organizations that may qualify technicians). Deliverable: Draft report to EPA; Due Date: Six weeks after EPA's formal acceptance the contractor's work plan; Deliverable: Final report to EPA; Due Date: Three weeks after receipt of comments from EPA.  Task 5 Analysis - The contractor shall assist EPA with analyses of the multi-family, high-rise buildings data from current and future pilots as well as other topics that are relevant to the program. These ad-hoc analyses arise in the course of the development of environmental programs and shall be determine through technical directives issued by EPA. (For the purpose of estimating level of effort for this task, the contractor shall assume that EPA will request three technical analyses that would require no more than thirty work hours each by the contractor.) Deliverable: To be determined by technical directive; Due Date: To be determined by technical directive. Task 6  Program Support - The contractor shall assist EPA at conferences and workshops related to building science and multi-family housing by providing guidance and technical expertise on ENERGY STAR Multi-Family High-Rise pilot requirements and findings. (For the purpose of estimating level of effort for this task, the contractor shall assume that EPA will request the contractor's expertise at 3 conferences located within the United States.) Deliverable: To be determined by technical directive; Due Date: To be determined by technical directive. Other requirements:  Progress Reports:   The contractor shall report progress to the EPA TOPO on all tasks via phone or e-mail periodically and via written monthly progress reports. Progress reports should include the progress to date for individual tasks, LOE spent on each task to date, estimated LOE to complete each task, any recommendations for reducing the LOE required to complete tasks, total dollars and hours spent to date, and total dollars and hours remaining to be spent. Deliverables: Monthly progress reports due 15 days following the month the report covers. Form of Deliverables: Unless otherwise indicated, all deliverables shall be delivered electronically as attachments to e-mail. Word processing documents shall be delivered in WordPerfect. All materials developed under this task order are the property of EPA; the Contractor may not claim copyrights.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>1.  The Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is soliciting interest and capability statements for a competitive acquisition for training services to provide Air Advisor training in support of HQ AETC.  Air Advisor training will support approximately 1000 expeditionary students annually.  The Air Advisor Program is an evolving program.  Requirements identified in the Performance-based Work Statement (PWS) may require modification as the program progresses.  Changes may include adjustment of training hours, mutually agreed upon acceleration of the workload estimates, changes to the syllabus, and other modifications as necessary to ensure an effective Air Advisor Program.

2.  During the performance period, the place of performance would start at the United States Air Force Expeditionary Center (EC) at Ft. Dix, New Jersey and then might transition to another location upon the availability of alternate Government facilities.  The Air Advisor training course would be required to be conducted in approximately 21 training days.  This course would provide just-in-time pre-deployment ground centric training for USAF, DoD, or Department of State personnel in advanced weapons handling, combat lifesaver, enhanced force protection, improvised explosive device (IED) awareness, high threat driving, language, cultural awareness, counterinsurgency, and other critical ground training.  Training would be student-centered with hands-on scenarios and practical exercises.

3.  The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP), but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing the RFP.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 611699 applies.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size for code 611699, particularly if they are a small business (the small business size standard is $6.5 million).  Small business means small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business.  If business size is transitioning to other than small business in the next 90 days, please indicate as such.  Prospective vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.

4.  This sources sought notice is for market research purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  It is not the intention of the Government to enter into a contract based on this notice or to otherwise pay for information solicited.  If the Government decides to contract for this effort at a later date with the issuance of an RFP to industry, the requirement would consist of a basic year and three (3) option years.

5.  A draft PWS has been posted along with this sources sought synopsis to provide a more detailed description of the requirement, and for any industry comments.  The PWS is still a work-in-progress, and this is NOT the final version.

6.  It is the Governments intent to award one contract.  The Government currently plans to issue an unrestricted solicitation; however, it reserves the right to make this a small business (SB) set-aside based on the interest and technical capabilities received from SB concerns.  (Under an unrestricted solicitation, large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.)  Therefore, it is requested that SB concerns provide sufficient written information supporting their capability to perform (items H, I and J below).

7.  All interested parties are invited to provide the following information for your company/institution and for any teaming or joint venture partners:

A.  Company/Institute Name and CAGE code.
B.  Mailing Address.
C.  Point of Contact (to include phone number and e-mail address).
D.  Web site, if applicable.
E.  State if your company is registered under NAICS code 611699 or not.
F.  State whether your company is a small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned small, HUB-Zone, or an 8(a) certified business concern.
G.  State the size of your company in terms of personnel.
H.  Briefly describe your companys degree of experience in providing combat skills, culture, and language training.
I.  Identify any past or current Government contracts for the aforementioned or similar services that your company was awarded within the last three years.
J.  Briefly describe how your company can satisfy the requirements described in the attached PWS and your associated technical capabilities; and any information you deem relevant to support your firms capability to perform this requirement.
K.  Provide any relative, readily available pricing data/information (i.e., public catalogs and/or price lists). Any other pricing data, if submitted, shall be as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM).
L.  Provide any comments or recommendations for the PWS.

8.  Responses are due no later than 1600 CDT, Wednesday, 22 October 2008, and shall be electronically submitted to both the Contract Manager, 1Lt Antony Barrios, at antony.barrios@randolph.af.mil and the Contracting Officer, Mr. Andrew Feutz, at andrew.feutz@randolph.af.mil in a Word 97 (or above) or Adobe PDF file format.

9.  Questions relative to this market research should be sent electronically to both 1Lt Antony Barrios and Andrew Feutz.

<DESC><p>Title of Announcement: Fuze Technology Research Sources Sought
<p>Research and Development (R&amp;D) sources are sought for the Sub-millimeter Wave Imaging Fuze Technology (SWIFT) Exploratory Development project which intends to develop and demonstrate a breadboard imaging fuze sensor. The objective of this program will be to design an active imaging fuze sensor architecture that is nose mounted on a weapon airframe with a diameter ranging from 3 to 7 inches. This fuze sensor is intended to detect airborne or surface targets of interest; determine the range, range rate, and location of the target with respect to the airframe's coordinate system; and declare the aimpoint on the target for use by an electrically aimed kill mechanism. The goals for this sensor are to detect the target, locate its centroid, and declare an aimpoint at sufficient distance for invoking the kill mechanism. Although active radar components have been demonstrated up to 800 GHz, this effort intends to limit the choices of operating frequency to those that can be supported by commercially available test equipment. The purpose of this sources sought is to determine what capabilities exist in Industry to design, fabricate and evaluate the SWIFT concept. Technologies of interest include sources, modulators, mixers, antenna arrays, radar architectures, algorithms, clutter measurements, target measurements, synthetic scene generation software, etc; that could be used to realize the SWIFT concept. Anticipated tasks of this effort are as follows: concept refinement, concept simulation, breadboard fabrication, limited signature measurements, and limited dynamic field testing for simulation validation. The period of performance for this effort is anticipated to be 36 months. At this time we are requesting for agency consideration, information/qualification packages from all responsible sources that reflect their interest, capability to perform design and development of this next generation active imaging fuze sensor concept, and relevant firm/personnel background. Submit information/qualification package to AFRL/RWK, Attention: Connie Homan/Laura Klepper, 101 West Eglin Boulevard (Bldg 13), Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810, and reference RWK-RFI-09-001. Firms will be evaluated on their experience, personnel, and facilities. Responses to this synopsis must be received within 30 days from the date of publication. Respondents to this notice will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of information submitted. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Firms responding to this synopsis should state the size and/or category of their firm for NAICS Code 541712 (500 people).</p>

The Kansas City Commodity Office (KCCO), Domestic Procurement Division, is seeking qualified companies to supply and to provide comments on the procurement of frozen whole wheat tortillas. This notice will serve as the market research to obtain information for this commercial item. All information gathered in response to this Sources Sought Announcement will be used solely for planning purposes. This is not a formal solicitation but a request for interested parties to provide information. No current solicitation exists and requests for a solicitation will not be considered. 

Section 4305 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (Farm Bill) authorizes the purchase of whole grain USDA commodities in addition to the commodities currently provided for use in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP) during Fiscal Year 2009. We are looking for prospective suppliers of frozen whole wheat tortillas. The goal of this pilot program is to determine whether children participating in NSLP and SBP increase their consumption of whole grains, and which whole grains are most acceptable for use in the NSLP.   

The legislation in the Farm Bill indicates that whole grain products meet the HealthierUS School Challenge (HUSSC) criteria for whole grains.  The food must be at least one grain/bread serving as defined by the Food Buying Guide for Child Nutrition Programs, AND a whole grain is listed as the first ingredient on the ingredient statement; OR, if a whole grain is not listed as the first ingredient (such as products with multiple whole grain ingredients), the weight of all whole grains added together must be the primary ingredient by weight (documentation must be obtained from the manufacturer).  Commercial Item Description (CID),  A-A-20143A, January 5, 2000, for Tortillas, Tortilla Chips, Taco Shells, and Tostada Shells includes a selection for wheat but not whole wheat as an ingredient.  In addition, the CID states unless otherwise stated in the solicitation the wheat content shall not exceed 50%.  In order for this product to meet the HUSSC criteria, the product must be at least 51% whole wheat.  

The Government intends to issue solicitations for multiple awards. The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 311830 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. 

Future invitations will specify the various types of commodities to be procured, the specifications, the office to which offers are to be submitted, the closing time for receipt of offers, and all other applicable provisions. Specific information from interested parties is required in order for KCCO to initiate this procurement. Please provide information on product functionality and performance, product quality, vendor capabilities, and your interest in the procurement.

Vendor Capabilities: 1) Capacity capabilities (e.g. 10 truckloads monthly), 2) pack size(s), 3) transportation issues, including standard truck size, 4) any other issues or concerns, and 5) point of contact information.  

Product Quality, Functionality, and Performance: 1) Brand name(s), 2) shelf life, 3) nutritional information and ingredients, 4) warranty, 5) preparation and handling information, 6) each interested supplier shall provide one case of each product for sampling purposes. Mail product samples to: Sheldon Gordon, USDA/FNS/FDD, 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, Virginia  22302

Written responses shall be mailed to the attention of Jeff Jackson, Processed Commodities Branch, USDA/FSA/Kansas City Commodity Office, Beacon Facility stop 8718, P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, MO 64141-6205. KCCO can also be contacted by Telephone: 816-926-2530, alternate numbers, 816-926-6062/6064 or via email at jeffrey.jackson@kcc.usda.gov. These responses must be received no later than 10 days after publication of this notice. This proposed procurement is full and open competition and/or small business set-aside.

<DESC>1.0  	BACKGROUND

As part of the Department of Energy (DOE) Hydrogen Safety and Codes & Standards Subprogram Hydrogen, Fuel Cell and Infrastructure Technologies (HFCIT) the National Renewable Energy Laboratorys (NREL) facilitates the permitting of renewable energy projects by helping to make the permitting process more predictable, less time-consuming and more efficient both for project developers and permitting officials.  Through this effort, NREL may also facilitate the development of permitting processes that have some consistency nationally. 

In 2007 and 2008, NREL facilitated several Hydrogen Permitting Workshops held in various locations throughout the country.  The participants were comprised of local/state fire marshals and fire safety and permitting officials; the objectives were as follows: 

1.	Familiarize participants with examples of Hydrogen Fueling Station projects that have been implemented in the United States
2.	Familiarize participants with the codes and standards and the processes that have been used by local/state officials to permit projects
3.	Provide participants the opportunity to conduct Virtual Permitting of projects that have already been permitted  to understand how they would do the permitting, given available information about the projects and available codes and standards
4.	Identify critical issues associated with the permitting process that need to be addressed by DOE in order to make the permitting process more cost effective and efficient
5.	Provide participants with the opportunity to articulate codes and standards gaps (if any) that need to be addressed

Workshop recommendations to NREL included conducting similar regional workshops targeted at fire marshals and fire safety and permitting officials in states or regions hydrogen and other renewable energy projects are planned.

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE 09-01 Submersible Aircraft Proposers Day Conference:
DARPA will host a Proposers Day Conference for the Submersible Aircraft program on October 17, 2008 from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, at the Booz Allen Hamilton building located at 3811 N Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203 in support of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) DARPA-BAA09-06 (expected to be released prior to the Conference).  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the Submersible Aircraft program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  DARPA anticipates releasing the BAA for the Submersible Aircraft program with the objective of exploring the possibility of developing a single platform that is capable of both flying through the air and submerging below the water. The difficulty with developing such a platform arises from the diametrically opposed requirements that exist for an airplane and a submarine. While the primary goal for airplane designers is to try and minimize weight, a submarine must be extremely heavy in order to submerge underwater. DARPA is interested in a feasibility study and experiments that would provide proof of concept for the realization of an aircraft that can maneuver underwater.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register no later than close of business (5:00 PM ET) October 14, 2008, at the following website:   https://www.enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=BAA94808 Conference Code: BAA94808.  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  

Due to space limitations at the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 70 registrants, and no more than 2 representatives per organization.  The Proposers Day will be unclassified and open to the general public.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference.  Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 Foreign National Visit Request.  The completed Citizenship Form or DARPA Form 60 must be faxed to:  AJ Diaz, Booz Allen Hamilton, fax 703-816-5444, phone 703-816-5263, no later than October 14, 2008.  Both documents are available for download at the registration website.  Attendance is not required to propose to the BAA for this program.  

Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so.  Presentations may contain 5 slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues).  Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at the Proposers Day Conference should send the request, along with an electronic copy of all material to be presented, to SN09-01@darpa.mil as soon as possible, but no later than October 14, 2008.  

All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the researching organization and the DARPA Program Manager.  The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material for sensitive but unclassified material and approve in advance any presentations.  It is the presenters responsibility to ensure that all material it plans to present at the Proposers Day Conference has been approved by the background research organization in advance.  An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be provided to the DARPA Program Manager for review by October 14, 2008.  There will be no exceptions to this requirement.

<SUBJECT>LASER-BASED LANDING AID FOR HELICOPTER LOW-LEVEL OPERATIONS (HELO)
<SOLNBR>N00421-09-R-0007A
<RESPDATE>110308
<CONTACT>Stephen Lucianetti, Phone 3017579707, Email stephen.lucianetti@navy.mil
<DESC>This is a specific request for white paper submissions under BAA N00421-09-R-0007 posted on 2 October 2008 for a laser-based landing aid for helicopter low-level operations (helo) from the Naval Air Warfare, Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD.  There is no solicitation at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. The Naval Air Systems Command is seeking information from potential sources for an advanced technology to be developed comprised of critical sub-systems and components that will help to enable an effective and affordable helicopter low-level operation laser-based landing aid system.

The capability need for this landing aid, designated HELO Product 2, is to provide significantly increased and improved landing capabilities for the survivability of current and future assault and heavy-lift rotary wing aircraft deployed from the sea base to operate in austere, forward areas.  This capability will support and improve the efficiency and safety of landing into unprepared Landing Zones (LZs).  This capability will add situational awareness to enable enhanced surface feature mapping and obstacle detection in order to apply this technology to dusty LZs or areas where visual cues are unavailable.

Helicopters landing in unprepared LZs often encounter brownout conditions due to blowing dust. Under such conditions, basic situational awareness may be lost, for example loss of horizon, inability to detect obstacles on the ground, and inability to judge ground speed. These difficulties have led to serious accidents that involved loss of life and aircraft.

The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is currently developing a laser-based groundspeed/airspeed system to provide information to the helicopter pilot via a hover display. The developmental system provides promising improvement to helicopter operations under degraded visual environment (DVE).  The proposed Future Naval Capability (FNC) Landing Aid Science & Technology (S&T) effort would advance such capabilities to include surface feature mapping and to apply this imaging or mapping functionality to dusty LZs and where visual cues are unavailable.   
Target Platform for Technology:  A target platform for this technology to be developed is the CH-53E/K.  The CH-53E/K programs enable rapid, decisive operations and early termination of conflict by projecting and sustaining forces to distant access-denied environments.  Under current Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW) supporting concepts, there is a continuing need for a vertical heavy-lift capability to support expeditionary and sea-based operations.  The CH-53E/K provides the capability to move and sustain highly mobile forces, operating long distances from the sea base and is capable of lifting heavy equipment including the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle and/or the Light Armored Vehicle.  The expeditionary nature of the mission requires frequent operations on unimproved landing areas that are likely to degrade visual conditions to a brownout status due to the severe rotor downwash of a CH-53E/K.  In addition, the loss of visual ground reference during night landings to unimproved, dusty landing zones is one of the greatest safety risks to CH-53E/K aircrew, passengers, and aircraft.  The GWOT has necessitated H-53 operations in unimproved landing zones and conditions that may cause loss of visual reference due to dust, snow, fog, smoke, or darkness.  The need for improved safety in these helicopter landing zones makes laser based landing aid technology a good transitional candidate for the CH-53E/K program.  
White Paper responses shall address the following areas:

1)  Evaluation Criteria:

The need is to provide a laser-based image or detailed contour map of the landing zone for safety of aircrew, passengers, cargo and LZ ground personnel.  Other considerations to be made:

	Laser-based landing aid to enable all-weather, day and night landing capability in unprepared LZs with zero visual ground reference (brownout/night).

	Situational awareness will also be enhanced by rapid updates to include surface feature mapping and obstacle detection, applying this functionality to dynamic and dusty LZs. 

	Primary risks associated with development of laser-based landing aids are that current technologies are non-responsive in certain relevant areas.  There are several key areas to consider for this response as follows:

o	Penetration of dust, sand, and modulation techniques in signal processing  allowance for a clear image or map through backscatter.
o	Scan/receive/refresh/record rate  needs to be fast enough to support pilots needs in a dynamic landing zone, which could include moving vehicles or personnel within this landing zone.  Vendor should provide assumptions of vehicle/personnel motion (speed) and reflectance.  Onboard record rate, for developmental program, needs to be sufficient to provide adequate data analysis in identification of the demands of the environment.  
o	Eye safety  consideration of ground and aircraft personnel eye safety concerns to be addressed with laser use.
o	Modeling  modeling techniques and methods that can describe the DVE effects adequately to support HELO Product 2 development decisions appropriately.
o	GPS denied environment  capability must consider the potential for the use of this landing aid in a GPS-denied environment.
o	Priority consideration should be given to single ship, single pass CONOPS.  Developmental provisions, such as data transfer, may be considered.
o	Priority consideration for laser only system configuration.  Developmental provisions for future multi-sensor fusion may be considered. 

	In determining a solution for this particular effort, non-mechanical scanning or other suitable alternate technology that provides very high speed lidar area coverage is desired.

2)	Cost/Schedule/Technology Readiness Level (TRL):

Off-the-shelf technologies have failed to provide an acceptable solution for this problem; therefore, this effort is for a developmental program.  TRL-3 is the minimum desired starting point for this effort with potential to mature to TRL-6 by 4Q, FY12.   Please provide a ROM/cost estimate as part of your response.

3)	Technical Areas/Exit Criteria:

Currently, NAVAIR has developed the following technical parameters of interest for this capability, which will be refined during the further development of the technology and through concept design review.  These technical areas and exit criteria should also be addressed in your response to this request:   (O = Objective; T = Threshold)

	All capabilities required in reduced visual cue environments. Ability to see through sand, dust, fog, rain, snow (O) and ability to see through sand and dust (T).  Modeling and simulation shall provide evidence of effectiveness where demonstration cannot reasonably be achieved.  
	Operational in a GPS-denied environment.
	Brownout pilot aid capable of allowing landing in conditions of zero visibility and winds from 0 to 45 kts from any direction from a range of 500 ft (O) and 150 ft (T).
	Mapping of surface features with sufficient resolution to:
o	Detect wires 1 diameter at 500 altitude (O); 3/8 diameter at 150 altitude (T)  
o	Detect LZ surface features such as crevices, ditches, and slopes 6 in diameter and 6 high in 4 rotor diameters (320) LZ at 500 alt (O); slopes 6 in diameter and 6 high in 2 rotor diameters (160) LZ at 150 alt (T).
o	Detect LZ obstacles as small as 0.5 ft in width and 0.5 ft in height. 
	Provide a real-time visual display of the LZ with the following capabilities:
	Display update rate 30hz (O) and 25hz (T)
	Class IA eyesafe mode available
	Data update rate  100hz or better
	Low-airspeed measurement system accurate to +/- 1 kt (O) and +/- 2 kt (T) +/- 5 deg azimuths at airspeeds below 45 kts, and +/- 0.3 kts (0.5 ft/sec) (O) or +/- 0.6 kts (1 ft/sec) (T) below 10 kts with +/- 2 deg azimuth.
	Groundspeed measurement system accurate to +/- 0.25 kt (O) and +/- 1 kt (T).
	Brownout pilot aid capable of passing ADS-33 handling qualities assessment in conditions of zero visibility and winds of up to 45 kts from any direction.
	Ground speed measurement from 0 kts to 250 kts (O) and 50 kts (T), with an accuracy of +/- 1 kt and a display resolution of 1 kt.
	Altitude measurement (AGL) from 0 feet from landing gear to 150 feet (T) and >500 feet (O) with a resolution accuracy of +/- 1 foot.
	Maximum pitch +/-15&#61616; (O/T) and maximum roll +/-30&#61616;(O/T).
	Minimum field of view 1 rotor diameter (80) at 25 AGL (O/T).
	System weight:  12 lbs (O) and 25 lbs (T).   Vendor feasibility comments on weight thresholds are requested.  While weight is a consideration on the H-53 platform, vendors should consider that a weight reduction timeline for future packaging may be an acceptable course of action.
	Operation with sling load  system will provide all capabilities with or without the presence of a sling load.

<DESC>The Armys Product Manager, Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS) is requesting information on the state of the art within the manufacturing industry and the availability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) equipment.  Focus is an image based, currently commercially available, capability to non-intrusively inspect steel-walled tankers, tractor trailers, towed vehicles, cargo containers, automobiles, pick-up trucks, buses, towed trailers, military vehicles, railcars and large pallets for the presence of concealed explosives, weapons, drugs, people and other contraband.<BR><BR>Please provide a white paper (10-page limit) explaining the system or synergistic mix of systems, with supporting rationale, you believe will provide the best solution for the Army.  Consider:  (1) mobile systems capable of traveling on primary and secondary roadways and can be set up to operate as a stationary portal; ( 2) mobile systems capable of cross country travel with integrated ballistic blast protection capable of operating proposed systems as a stationary portal for forward deployed operations; (3) fixed or relocatable  gantry systems;   (4) rail inspection systems that can view rail cars with double stacked sea containers; (5) large and small pallet inspection systems capable of inspecting a standard 4x4 foot pallet up to and including the large air containers; and (6) The system should be capable of providing  the following: <BR><BR>-	 Operationally, individual systems or combinations need to completely penetrate the range of potential threats from automobiles or small trucks with light loads to larger vehicles or containers with complex loads, to include water, fuel, cement, sand, gravel or similar dense materiel and/or empties and provide high throughput. <BR><BR>-	Mobile systems for forward deployed operations should be capable of movement on primary, secondary, and un-maintained surfaces.  If a separate vehicle is required it should be capable of being driven on its own power operating at Gross Vehicle Weight, including the supplemental imaging system. Militarization includes: use of JP8, the standard military fuel; C-130 transportability; and protection of operators from ballistic or blast threats. Standard for protection is no less than a level II (factory produced add on kit) consisting of, at a minimum,  doors, back plate, air conditioning and plates for the lower perimeter of the vehicle, and ballistic windshields and upgradable to Frag 5 standards. This protection is to minimize risk of IEDs, rocket propelled grenades, 7.62mm ammunition and land mines.  If a trailer is utilized it should be commercial or military standard but compatible with the mobile platform in terms of mobility, towing hitch and power/light connections. <BR><BR>-	All systems should include a remote operating and viewing capability utilizing wireless, fiber optic cable or copper wire to a minimum of 250 feet from the system.  If RF capability is recommended a proposed method of frequency management   in complex electronic environments must be included. <BR><BR>In the White Paper include Company / manufacturing information. Describe your previous experience in manufacturing and delivery of systems believed to provide the required capabilities. If your company is a system integrator describe your previous experience with integration of such systems. <BR><BR>Technical data may be presented in support of rationale contained in the White Paper but for each system recommended must include a listing of operational parameters including; penetration, contrast sensitivity, wire detection, spatial resolution, mode, dual views and image format. Measurements for the parameters shall be in accordance with ANSI N42.46 (Measuring the Imaging Performance of X-ray and Gamma-ray Systems for Cargo and Vehicle Security Screening), 18 August 2008.  With regard to radiation safety, identify the radiation safety systems and the limits of the control area for non-radiation workers.<BR><BR>Included in the systems description should also be operational parameters such as equipment footprint requirements, the minimum number of people required to safely operate the system (staffing), periodic maintenance requirements, number of operator stations, and ability to store and manage images and training instruction requirements, and description of its operational environment with regard to temperature range extremes and maximum wind conditions the system can function under, power and other utility requirements for standalone operation, and transportability and storage requirements, if applicable. <BR><BR>Also desired is information pertaining to determine materials discrimination and detection of radioactive materials.<BR><BR>This request is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government.  This document will assist the Government in identifying potential solutions. This is not a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or an announcement of a solicitation. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect future ability to submit an offer if a solicitation is released.

Every person (contractor/subcontractor) must obtain a pass, long term or short term, (AF Form 75) to gain entry to base. Short- term passes (24 hours or less) may be obtained at the Main Gate Visitors Center. All passes for longer than 24 hours are issued at Pass and Registration, Building 100, Suite 1001. Duty hours are Monday- Friday 0730 - 1600 hours . Large vehicles (pickup trucks or larger) that carry tools, toolboxes, equipment, supplies, etc. shall use the Commercial Gate (South Gate) for base access. Passenger type vehicles including minivans and pickup trucks that do not carry tools, toolboxes, supplies, and equipment, etc. shall use the Main Gate for base access. All contractor/subcontractor employees shall exit via the Main Gate.

Any vehicle entering the base is subject to inspection at any time. Refusal may result in the individual being temporarily or permanently barred from the base.</p>
<p>(b) All contractors/subcontractors are subject to criminal background checks prior to being allowed on base to work. Contractors/subcontractors will not be issued passes prior to submitting to background checks and being cleared by Security Forces Squadron (approximately a two week period). Contractors/subcontractors may be barred from base at the Installation Commander's discretion based on unfavorable information resulting from background checks.

If contractor/subcontractor employees are added after initiation of work, the base entry list, in its entirety, indicating additions/deletions, shall be resubmitted not later than seven (7) days prior to the individual(s) starting work on McChord AFB.</p>

Contractors must report missing employees with passes. Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in withholding of final payment.</p>
<p>(e) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, as applicable.</p>

<CONTACT>Cassandra C Ellis, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-451-3691, Fax 301-480-4675, Email ellisca@niaid.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking a contractor to provide a resource of preclinical and non-clinical services to advance the development of Topical microbicides (TM) and biomedical prevention (BP).  There is a critical need to promote discovery and transition of new strategies into clinical trials.  This NIAID-sponsored contract focuses on promoting the development of strategies containing TM/BP as a means to address the NIAID and Division of AIDS (DAIDS) priority of controlling and preventing the HIV/AIDS epidemic worldwide.  This contract will provide pre-clinical and non-clinical development services of TM/BP products essential for advancement to clinical testing and for supporting activities required for IND and NDE applications to the FDA.  TM/BP products for development services will be provided by or through the Project Officer and will be identified through NIAID-funded grants and contracts, the private sector, or other sources.  The specific services required will depend on the status of the individual candidate(s), the need to prioritize potential candidates, and an overall product development plan and/or regulatory submission plan to the FDA.  The scope of pre-clinical and non-clinical services to be provided include: (1) Individual gap-filling services on a case-by-case basis, to advance TM/BP products in the development pathway toward clinical assessment; (2) Comprehensive services for selected TM/BP products through a Go/No-Go milestone-driven pathway to accelerate a product toward clinical testing in the most efficient manner; and (3) Support for Best Practices Working Groups (BPWGs) composed of non-contract investigators to assess the critical processes and assays used to compare and advance products to clinical studies.  This activity will ultimately lead to identification and validation of surrogate biomarkers for safety and efficacy testing in clinical trials.  The Government anticipates the potential need to exercise options for additional BPWGs during the life of the contract.  It is estimated that up to four options for a total of 4 BPWGs will be exercised at the discretion of the Government during the period of the contract.  These options may be exercised during contract years 2-7.  The NIAID reserves the right to exercise more than one option per year, however, the total number of options will not exceed four during the 7-year period of the contract.  The NAICS code is 541 & 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  This RFP will be available electronically on/about September 9, 2008, and may be accessed through the Federal Business Opportunities at https://www.fbo.gov and the NIAID Office of Acquisition (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).
