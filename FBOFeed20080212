<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  This project will be funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), DHHS, in conjunction with the NIAID, NIH.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for the development of a prophylactic multivalent filovirus vaccine that is capable of protecting against both Ebola and Marburg viruses, utilizing platform technology such that the same basic development and manufacturing process is used to develop each component of the final multivalent vaccine.  NOTE 1:  This solicitation will NOT support the development of devices for the delivery of vaccines; the development of therapeutic agents and therapeutic vaccines; the development of new animal models or refinement of existing animal models; the design and conduct of Phase 3 clinical trials; nor the development of any adjuvants which are not currently used in FDA-licensed vaccines.  NOTE 2:  BSL-4 facilities for animal model development, animal model vaccine efficacy testing, and assay development are to be proposed by the offeror(s). However, the Government retains the right to negotiate the most effective and efficient mechanisms for providing such facilities.  This solicitation seeks to fund organizations with demonstrated vaccine product development experience to advance development of a prophylactic candidate multivalent filovirus vaccine that protects against both Ebola and Marburg viruses.  For the purposes of this solicitation, candidate vaccines need not have been tested in a multivalent manner nor have shown protection against all desired strains of Ebola and Marburg.  Candidate vaccines eligible for support must have two characteristics:  First, a candidate vaccine must utilize a platform technology such that the same basic development and manufacturing process can be used to develop each component of the final multivalent vaccine; and Second, the proposed platform technology must have been used successfully to demonstrate the efficacy of the vaccine candidate in non-human primate (NHP) Ebola and Marburg challenge models.  It is sufficient for the platform technology to have demonstrated protection in a monovalent vaccination/challenge study design, that is, a monovalent Marburg vaccine tested in the Marburg NHP challenge model and a monovalent Ebola vaccine tested in the Ebola NHP challenge model.  The target multivalent vaccine must contain/express antigens of SEBOV, ZEBOV, ICEBOV, RAVN, and either Ci67, Musoke, or another closely related strain of Marburg, and must provide for a relatively rapid onset of protection following no more than two doses, post-exposure prophylaxis will also be considered.  Protection is defined as proof of concept efficacy (greater than 80% survival) in the NHP challenge model (i.m. route of infection with greater than or equal to 100 pfu of challenge virus).  Offerors must propose a well-defined and feasible Product Development Plan for advancing the vaccine candidate by carrying out the following research and development activities as specified in the negotiated Statement of Work:  1) development and update of the Product Development Plan for a multivalent filovirus vaccine candidate, including regulatory, clinical, non-clinical, and manufacturing activities to be undertaken; 2) manufacturing and formulation process development; 3) manufacturing of pilot lot cGMP material; 4) real time and accelerated vaccine stability studies; 5) conduct of non-clinical studies, including all Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies and multivalent immunogenicity interference studies; 6) development, qualification and, where necessary, validation of all assays and reagents necessary to support product development; 7) development, submission, and sponsorship of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, including compliance with all regulatory requirements; 8) design, conduct, completion, and analysis of a Phase 1 dose-escalating clinical trial of the multivalent vaccine candidate in healthy subjects ages 18 to 40; 9) the provision of clinical and non-clinical samples from all studies to NIAID and, for clinical trials, obtaining future use consent from volunteers for their samples; and 10) the provision to NIAID of cGMP final container vaccine and all necessary supporting documentation/letters of cross-reference to allow NIAID to perform subsequent clinical trials.  OPTIONS:  Contracts awarded under this Broad Agency Announcement will include three Options that may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  Options 1 and 2 may be undertaken concurrently. However, Option 3 may not be undertaken until successful completion of the tasks described in Option 1 as determined by the Government.

<DESC>The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), under the Department of Homeland Security, seeks 28 (twenty-eight) healthy head of cattle within the weight range of 400 lbs. to 450 lbs. to be delivered to Orient Point, New York, on Wednesday, February 27, 2008.

For this competitive, best value procurement, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) certification of the Supplier's facilities may convey some assurance of an acceptable source. In addition, the Supplier must ensure and demonstrate that the animals, in particular younger animals, are not overly stressed and fatigued, for instance, as a result of prolonged transportation, which could compromise the animals' immune systems. Furthermore, in order to minimize any variability between tests, the cattle should come from a homogeneous source without having co-mingled with other cattle. Any exception to this requirement must be documented and explained.

Prior to departure for Orient Point and PIADC, the Supplier shall verify that each head of cattle has had a veterinary examination along with the appropriate vaccinations (example Bovishield) and boosters as necessary as well as antibiotics prior to transport to prevent any in transit fever. Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, each animal shall be issued a health certificate for interstate transportation. Also, the Supplier shall submit a document with the recent medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments for each animal. This report shall include, at a minimum, general information identifying the animal by number/ID; the departure date of transport to Orient Point/Plum Island; breed; gender; age or birth date range; (de)horned; weaned; castrated (if applicable); the dates and dosages for vaccines and anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, antibiotic drugs; any other tests and corresponding results; and any other interesting and important information. Accurate and consistent with the medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments mentioned above, all animals must be:

-	Holsteins;
-	castrated males;
-	healthy with no overt signs of disease;
-	free of active lameness, respiratory disease, warts, or ringworm;
-	polled or dehorned;
-	tolerant of being haltered (i.e. of tractable temperament and be free of behavioral vices such as charging and kicking); and
-	free of external parasites and have been treated for internal parasites within the last three (3) months (preferably using Ivermectin).

Additional requirements are as follows:

-	the cattle must have un-pigmented (i.e pink) tongues;
-	the hooves of the cattle shall be trimmed prior to shipment; and
-	the ears of the cattle shall be notched for Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD).

After notification of award, the Supplier shall deliver (F.O.B. Origin) the cattle, and corresponding documentation to the USDHS/S&T/PIADC Warehouse, 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957 at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday, February 27, 2008. Utilizing a PIADC-owned wooden animal stockade ramp, available at the Orient Point destination, the Supplier shall offload the cattle from their vehicle then load the animals onto a U.S. Government vehicle.

Once the Supplier hands over the cattle to PIADC personnel at Orient Point, the animals will be quarantined and evaluated for seven (7) calendar days. Any animal that has been delivered but does not meet the criteria listed above or otherwise is considered by PIADC personnel to be unhealthy will be rejected and euthanized. PIADC personnel will inform the Supplier and prepare an animal incident report and send it, by fax or e-mail or both, to the Supplier promptly (within approximately three (3) calendar days, if reasonable and practicable). Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, and pending the resolution of any inquires or disputes, the Supplier shall compensate PIADC with an appropriate replacement of cattle for any unacceptable animal(s) following the quarantine and evaluation period.

We would like to emphasize the importance of and our necessity for healthy specimens. In particular, we are sensitive to and will reject any animal that carries or develops ringworm.

Please submit your responses before the deadline of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on February 21, 2008, to the attention of Ms. Patricia La Riviere-Hom, Contracts Specialist, (Telephone 631-323-3203) via e-mail at patricia.lariviere-hom@dhs.gov or by fax to 631-323-3101.

<SUBJECT>B--Alternative Energy Research - 2008 - Broad Agency Announcement
<SOLNBR>M08PS00023
<RESPDATE>031208
<ARCHDATE>04112008
<CONTACT>Bridge, Debra M.        703-787-1070,   debra.bridge@mms.gov
<DESC>This announcement solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length for specific topics of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS), Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs. BACKGROUND: Research sponsored by MMS through the TA&R Program is used to acquire basic engineering information needed to oversee the orderly development of offshore oil and gas, alternative energy, and alternate use operations. Over 600 studies have been funded in the area of offshore oil and gas, and information can be found at http://www.mms.gov/tarphome/ on completed and ongoing studies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave MMS the authority to regulate alternative energy projects and alternate use of existing oil and gas facilities on the OCS. Alternative energy includes but is not limited to, wind, wave, solar, underwater current and generation of hydrogen.  The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address safety and/or regulatory topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested.  Projects selected for funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2008 funds.  The MMS anticipates a total of approximately $ 300,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing Alternative Energy topics in FY 2008 with projects being identified through this announcement. NOTICE: MMS may share the White Papers that are submitted with other organizations for review. Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared. Contractors should plan to gather data from an external source for these projects, where applicable, as only limited data may be available from the MMS. OBJECTIVES: The topics for the FY 2008 Alternative Energy activities include ONLY research on the following two topics:   1.    Assess/Develop Inspection Methodologies for Offshore Wind Turbine Facilities.       Desired Outcome is to answer the following:  What are the crucial items?  What are the optimal inspection frequencies for the various components?  Are the standards in place in other countries suitable for use in the US operating environment?  Can certain items be inspected remotely or is a 100% hands-on inspection required?  Given the history of operations in other locations, what components/functions/operations show a trend of being the `high-risk? items?  What is the recommended inspection procedure?       Reason for Research:  It is anticipated that offshore wind farms will exist on the OCS in the foreseeable future.  Prior to installation of these facilities, an inspection strategy and methodology must be established that will ensure that facilities are maintained in a manner that ensures the integrity of the system, and the safety of all individuals associated with the wind farm. 2.    Assess the Design/Inspection Criteria/Standards for Wave and/or Current Energy Generating Devices.       Desired Outcome:   A study or studies that include a gap analysis to identify standards, guidelines and design parameters that are lacking or unavailable and make recommendations or approaches for addressing deficiencies.       Reason for Research:  It is anticipated that offshore wave and/or current parks will exist on the OCS in the foreseeable future.  Prior to installation of these facilities, design standards will have to be established.   Safety risk assessments will need to be conducted.  Operational monitoring/inspection systems will need to be established. Loading factors, factors of safety, fatigue drivers, failure consequences, and geo-technical issues will all have to be identified and evaluated. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to safety practices for offshore operations. As a result of the White Papers, full proposals will be sought and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should address the above stated issues. HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in .PDF and WORD compatible format on a CD shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Debra Bridge, not later than March 12, 2008, at 2:00 PM, E.T.  WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH E-MAIL AND FAXES WILL NOT ACCEPTED. White Papers should define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort. NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED. The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merit. If your White Paper is selected for further evaluation, a proposal shall be requested and you will be required to submit a cost proposal at that time. Projects shall be selected from all or part of the technical issues listed depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received. The MMS shall evaluate the responses, and those deemed to have merit shall be furnished information to assist in the preparation of a complete proposal. This announcement constitutes a Request for White Papers, but does not obligate the Government to consummate award. Respondents SHALL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation on the information submitted. WHITE PAPERS SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (1) feasibility of the approach or solution; (2) the offeror?s understanding of the technical issues; (3) the offerors ability to implement the proposed approach; (4) innovative or creative approaches or solutions including the participation and/or funding by other groups in the research industry, where appropriate; (5) past performance.  If any of the requirements of this announcement are not met, the White Paper will not be evaluated. QUESTIONS shall be e-mailed to debra.bridge@mms.gov. The RFP number M08PS00023 MUST be in the subject line of the E-mail. All questions shall include the RFP number, your full name and title, your organization, complete address, and telephone and fax numbers. Telephone inquires SHALL NOT be accepted. A separate White Paper shall be submitted for each study on which the offeror wished to propose. The White Paper shall clearly identify the offeror's company/organization, point of contact, address, telephone and facsimile numbers.

<SUBJECT>70 -- DIGITAL PRINTING AND IMAGING
<SOLNBR>R1766
<CONTACT>Mary  Peters mary.peters@gunter.af.mil
<DESC>Announcement to Potential Digital Printing and Imaging Small Business Vendors Sources Sought / Information The United States Air Force, through the Information Technology Commodity Council and HQ 754th Electronic Systems Group/ESB, is preparing to issue the small business portion of its enterprise Digital Printing and Imaging (DPI) strategy.  On 29 January 2008, the Air Force awarded Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to three large business Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) - Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark, and Xerox.  The next phase of the strategic plan is to award one, several or no BPAs to small business resellers for network printers, network multi-function printers (MFPs), associated toner/ink cartridges, supplies, and product support services to Air Force purchasers.  All DPI BPAs are based on General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules (FSS) and, as indicated herein, the resellers' products must be on these Schedules.   Small business resellers may team with any OEM, or combination of OEMs, to provide to provide DPI products and services, with the exception of those OEMs listed above who have already been awarded a DPI BPA.   Prior to responding to the Letter of Invitation (solicitation), please familiarize yourself with the overall strategy for this effort as documented in the attached Statement of Objectives (SOO).  Because the Air Force requires DPI capabilities all over the world, there are many possible variations of required products and delivery locations.  Many of these requirements cannot be predicted at the outset hence the need for an experienced reseller with the ability to obtain strategic partnerships with the leading OEMs and for this reseller to partner with the Air Force to ensure mutual success.  The Air Force is excited about the relationship with this small business, but the Contracting Officer is asking potential offerors to carefully review the full requirement to ensu!  re the business has the capability to perform and deliver.  It should be clear that the solicitation, its statement of objectives, and its evaluation criteria are critical and are aimed at communicating the Air Force's desire to obtain worldwide,  enterprise level products and associated services that will fill the Air Force's requirements now and as they evolve.  	As offerors are reviewing the statement of objectives, they should know that these requirements will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria and other stated requirements stated in the Invitation when requested.  While the Air Force needs strong competition and partners, it does not want a contractor to find the requirement too complex after investing many hours in their proposal development.  Additionally, strategic partners would be viewed by the government for the small business to enhance the existing OEM BPA holders.  Likewise, the Contracting Officer is planning a very streamlined evaluation and award of the BPA(s) in the shortest possible time. 	As the evaluation criteria will indicate in the invitation, the government has several requirements with very specific technical products, some specific security requirements, and an array of desired capabilities. These evaluation criteria will be linked to the objectives stated in the SOO.  Likewise, as a part of the overall acquisition strategy, the offeror is advised  to review the evaluation process in which the technical/management portion of the proposal will be provided to the government in oral presentations.   	To further review the detailed letter of invitation with the evaluation criteria and attachments, please notify the contracting officer, via electronic submission, at the address below and an invitation package will be forwarded to you.  Firm milestones have yet to be established for each effort such as the release of the invitation but will be established after the level of interest from small businesses is evaluated but may occur on approximately February 29, 2008.  Once milestones are established, they will be publicized in the same location.  To ensure no technical problems, please copy all of the following on your request for the bidding package: barbara.dobbins@gunter.af.mil; sandi.bader@gunter.af.mil and mary.peters@gunter.af.mil.   Questions may be directed to the contracting points of contact listed above.  The telephone numbers are 334-416-2309 for Mrs. Bader or 334-416-1896 for Mrs. Peters.  A conference call may be scheduled to discuss questions if the Contracting Officer believes a conference to be beneficial.  These calls should be arranged after SOO review as soon as possible but will be cut off on/about February 29, 2008.  All offerors should expect that non-proprietary questions and answers will be made publicly available.     Requirement changes/clarifications made as a result of questions and answers will be made available to all bidders.   Tentative award timeframe is late spring or early summer of 2008.

Identify the MEF(s) that require critical support from another Federal executive department or agency to ensure execution of their mission, and identify when and where the particular interdependency is executed within the BPA business process flow.  Recommend validation and confirmation processes to identify MEF(s) through consultation with department or agency heads.  Outline MEF(s) in a business process mapping format (inputs, outputs, resources, systems, facilities, expertise, authorities, etc).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The US Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP)  for the delivery and assessment of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) for  possible use in the Excalibur M982 Extended Range Precision Guided 155mm  artillery munition.  An IMU is a 6 degree-of-freedom digital inertial  measurement subsystem that is a component of a navigation system and which  consists of 6 micro-machined silicon sensors; 3 accelerometers, and 3-gyros.  The USG is seeking to test IMUs from alternate product sources that currently  meet the requirements of the Excalibur IMU Performance Specification, and  Electrical Interface Control Document, or hereon known as the IMU Spec and  ICD.  It is anticipated that the contractor shall provide 4-6 IMUs and conduct  characterization assessment before, then again after the Army has conducted  environmental conditioning at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ. The IMU Spec and ICD have  limited distribution to DOD contractors; therefore, in order to receive this  documentation, interested sources must be DOD contractors and provide DOD  certification to the Government. Upon receipt of this verification, two  documents will be sent to the authorized contractor.  These documents describe  the IMU functional, physical, and environmental requirements for operation in  precision-guided, 155mm cannon-launched artillery projectiles. Without these  two documents, interested sources will be incapable of responding to this or  any possible future notice involving the IMU Spec and ICD. This effort is not  expected to exceed 6 months from start of contract.  The Government reserves  the right to make multiple awards.

<DESC>Federal Bureau of Investigation
Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division
System of Services Refreshment Program (SOSRP)
Request for Information (RFI) #08-0277055
2/12/08

This Request for Information (RFI) is in support of an anticipated acquisition for The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division in Clarksburg, West Virginia.  This anticipated effort will provide information technology (IT) services essential for the technology refreshment, sustainment, and enhancement of the CJIS System of Services (SoS).  The purpose of this RFI is for market research to identify companies interested in providing the IT services associated with this description of services as well as input regarding acquisition strategy, contract types, etc.  Additional information is located in the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) and two DRAFT Performance Work Statements (PWS) attached.

History:
The on-going efforts of the CJIS Division have been heavily focused on the development and implementation of major information and identification systems that make up the SoS including the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), National Crime Information Center (NCIC) System, National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and their supporting communication and networking systems.  Working in partnership with the Advisory Policy Board (APB), the vendor community, and the nation's criminal justice community, these state-of-the-art identification and information systems have been successfully developed and deployed.  

The FBI has made a significant investment in enhancing the quality, scope, and availability of national criminal information.  The use of the CJIS systems and networks by law enforcement officials fulfills a critical role in the investigative process.  As technology evolves, user needs and requests increase, and the existing information technology equipment becomes dated, the CJIS Division has enhanced and updated its systems to remain a viable partner to, and an integral part of, the nation's law enforcement community.  

During Fiscal Year (FY) 1999, CJIS accepted delivery of the NCIC 2000 System, the IAFIS, and the NICS.  Because of the interdependencies of these systems, the CJIS Division used a System of Systems concept to integrate these separate systems.  The Division's goal behind these systems was to provide robust, rapid information systems capable of meeting the many needs of the local, state, federal, and international law enforcement communities.

The CJIS Division initially began technology refreshment at the beginning of partial operations of the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) Segment in FY 1998.  This program was initially aimed at enhancing the technological advances made in the fingerprint characterization and matching sciences.  This effort continued to evolve and began addressing issues associated with estimated workload growth, equipment maintainability, and customer demand for services.  This program provided a basis for system refreshment planning and documented specific recommendations to improve system performance and reliability.  This led to the current contract known as the CJIS Division?s Technology Refreshment Program (TRP).  The TRP contracted effort provided a flexible approach to allow the continual re-engineering of the CJIS Systems in order to keep them technologically current.  The current Technology Refreshment Program (TRP) contract commenced in 2002 and will be ending in December 2008.   Based upon historical data, the average length of a CJIS SoS Technical Refreshment effort varies from 12-18 months with a cost estimate ranging from $400K to almost $10M.  The CJIS SoS Technical Analysis effort may also be used to conduct feasibility studies to determine requirements for current and future CJIS SoS technical refreshment efforts.  The average length of a CJIS SoS Technical Analysis effort varies from 3-12 months with costs ranging from $200K-$3M.  It is anticipated that this contract with consists of 3-4 efforts per year.

Statement of Need:
The need for the continuation of TRP-type activities by the SoS Refreshment Program (SOSRP) is evident.  First, additional requirements have been placed on CJIS systems due to changes in federal information technology laws, congressional mandates, homeland security issues, and policies that require CJIS customers to change their technology base.  Second, the information technology industry has made significant changes in both equipment and the operational paradigms that, in turn, drive technological evolution.  Finally, the expected obsolescence of the CJIS equipment necessitates specific replacements in order to maintain system availability.  

Scope:
This anticipated procurement action is to provide continuing TRP-type services to support the long-term needs of CJIS Division to refresh, enhance, and sustain the CJIS SoS.  The intended use of this contract is to perform small to medium sized technical refreshment efforts; preliminary and advanced technical analysis efforts to support developmental decisions; small to moderate developmental efforts for new or updated SoS capabilities; and legacy system sustainment, upgrade, and refreshment activities to keep the SoS current within its commercial hardware and software environments. The anticipated taskings will typically involve the development, deployment, integration, testing, and cutting into operational service significant capability and capacity improvements to the SoS and it's components.  These efforts will be comprised of technical services, selected equipment procurement, software development, and related management to support these activities.  

Constraints:
The SOSRP will be executed in an environment constrained by funding availability.  As such, the SOSRP is planned as a series of individual tasks designed to either align with or to be spread across more than one fiscal year, depending on funding availability and task duration.

The SOSRP is subject to space limitations within the CJIS Facility.  While the FBI expects to house some SOSRP personnel during the performance of this effort, the FBI desires that SOSRP space requirements within FBI facilities be kept to a minimum.  The majority of the SOSRP Contractor organization shall be located within Contractor facilities. 

The SOSRP is subject to the FBI Life Cycle Management Directive.  Each effort under this contract will be influenced and guided by the principles stated the FBI IT Life Cycle Management Directive (LCMD). 

The SOSRP is subject to FBI compliance audits, configuration management, quality assurance, and security accreditation for activities under this contract.  The FBI will ensure policy compliance to DOJ and FBI guidelines.  The FBI will monitor the configuration management process, hardware, software, testing, security documentation, and CJIS system infrastructure.  The FBI will oversee the implementation of quality assurance through the CJIS Quality Assurance Plan.  

During the contract period of performance, the Contractor shall abide by the requirements set forth in the Contract Security Classification Specification (DD Form 254)(to be provided when needed) and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5200.22-M, for the protection of classified information at its cleared facility, if applicable, as directed by the Defense Security Service.  If the Contractor has access to classified information at an FBI or other government facility, it shall abide by the requirements set by the agency.

The SOSRP Contractor shall utilize the same tool set or its equivalent that the FBI CJIS Division utilizes.  CJIS utilizes the IBM Rational suite of tools to perform system requirements management (RequisitePro), change management (ClearQuest), and software baseline versioning (ClearCase).  The Government maintains System Specification information within the Rational suite of tools. 

Incumbent Information:
The currently on-going TRP support contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin Corporation in August 2002.  

Instructions:

<SUBJECT>65 -- Central Venous Catheters and Supplies
<SOLNBR>APP9-10-0712-001
<RESPDATE>030508
<ARCHDATE>03062008
<CONTACT>Cindy Ingrao, Clinical Consultant, Phone 619-532-8517, Fax 619-532-5439, Email cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil
<DESC>A.	General Information
The Southwest Region is standardizing for a possible multi-vendor award for Central Venous Catheters & Supplies.  The region recognizes this is a specialized category in which vendors may manufacture and/or distribute subsets of the category.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs? needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes central venous catheters for use in cardiology, vascular and interventional medicine placed centrally or peripherally for short, intermediate, or long term care and their supplies. 
The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 
	
The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit?s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is May 2008. The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of Central Venous Catheters & Supplies comprised of monitoring catheters and their insertion and change kits and supplies for use in cardiology, vascular and interventional medicine and central venous catheters placed centrally or peripherally for short, intermediate, or long term care and their insertion and change kits and supplies. Within this region, this product line has an estimated dollar requirement of over $200,000. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales within a 12-month period. 

At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Offerors

If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than March 5, 2008. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:

Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN 
Tri-Service Regional Business Office 
MSMMO - Southwest Region 
34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria
1.	Vendors must provide central venous catheters and supplies like Catheter Dual Lumen PICC 5 Fr., Kit Triple Lumen Catheters 7X8 20CM, X-Port Arm Insertion Port, Stopcock Walrus, Set Radial Artery, Catheter Single Lumen 4 Fr., and Stopcock Large Bore 4-way among others.  Vendors must provide a list of the products they supply in this product line and the brand name to include the type, size and configuration.
2.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Prime Vendor supporting our Region, Cardinal Health or will be disqualified.
3.	Vendors must have a DAPA number or is in the process of obtaining a DAPA or will be disqualified.
4.	Your product line must be latex free and this must be indicated on the packaging of the product.
5.	Vendors must provide product literature for this product line.
6.	Vendors must provide 24/7 customer support and identify company resources for such support with their initial submittals.
7.	Vendors must submit prices lower than their DAPA or will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, national FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA
8.	Your products must meet the FDA requirements for medical devices.
9.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic excel format upon request.
10.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls/alerts that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for central venous catheters and supplies including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  This represents your sole opportunity to present this information. Provide any mitigating factors that you may have in order to provide a proper context for the cited back orders, recalls, etc.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the ?break?, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria Evaluation
1.	The catheter can be inserted easily and smoothly.
2.	The maximum barrier feature protects the user against blood borne pathogen exposure.
3.	The catheter is made of high quality sturdy material that resists kinks, bends and breakage.
4.	The catheter has a feature that prevents needlestick injury.
5.	The catheter can be connected securely to tubing and other monitoring equipment to prevent leakage.

Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

SUMMARY

The Construction & Equipment Supplier Operations is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) seeking integrated solutions for lumber products for a worldwide customer base.  The anticipated level of support from an integrator includes forecast collaboration with customers, leveraged purchasing from a robust supplier base, warehousing, distribution and material tracking.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is examining the potential for integrated supply solutions for Wood Products Program supporting lumber, plywood and related wood product supplies in Federal Stock Classes 5510, 5530 and 5520.  The majority of these items can be further delineated by grade and species.  This support applies to all of DLA?s continental U.S. (CONUS) customers and OCONUS (overseas) customers.  Presently, demands in CONUS are sourced through Prime Vendor Type Contract(s).  The Continental United States is currently divided into seven regions: the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Gulf, Midwest, Southwest and the Northwest.  The vendors are required to supply wood products (for other than facilities maintenance) to the customers in their respective regions.  Historical CONUS activity has been roughly 2500 orders from approximately 150 different customers for $14 million dollars annually.  OCONUS activity has historically involved in excess of 300 customers and covered approximately 5500 orders for $42 million annually.  The largest customers were located in areas involving contingencies.  There are approximately 9 CONUS based customers with sales in excess of $500,000.  Typical wood products requirements for other that facility maintenance include but are not limited to, box & crate making, cribbing, shoring, bracing, blocking, dry-docking, wharf building, military unique construction and large or otherwise unique orders.  The goals for this initiative are supporting the customer by ensuring reduced cycle times, achieving the best commercial pricing and structuring processes to ensure maximum oversight, reducing administrative burden and increasing customer satisfaction while allowing the customers to focus on their core competencies.

<DESC>FORMAL NOTICE OF A PERFORMANCE DECISION FOR AN A-76 STREAMLINED COMPETITION STUDY
This announcement constitutes notification of a performance decision and the completion of a streamlined competition study conducted by the Program Support Center (PSC), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  On February 8, 2008, the responsible competition officials certified the streamlined cost comparison which indicated that over a 5-year performance period, the total estimated private sector cost (using documented market research) was determined to be the low-cost service provider.  The commercial functions competed included space acquisition, tenant improvements and space alterations and rent billing services of the Administrative Operations Service (AOS), Division of Property Management (DPM), Space Management Branch (SMB).   The study period was from September 28, 2007 (public announcement date) through February 8, 2008, under FBO Reference Number A76DHHSPSCAOSDPMSPACEMANAGEMENTBRANCH.  
As a result of this performance decision, the responsible Contracting Officer and SMB Program Office shall initiate the development of a solicitation for issuance.

<SUBJECT>61 -- REMOVE AND REPLACE OPERATION CONSOLE FROM THE EXISTING SUPERVISORY CONTROL AND DATA ACQUISITION (SCADA) SYSTEM IN BLDG. 1805 ONBOARD FLEET ACTIVITIES YOKOSUKA, JAPAN.
<DESC>This is to announce prospective offerors of the contract requirements and the Navy's intent to award the contract non-competitively pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.

Description of Supplies / Services
Procurement of services to remove and replace and operation console from the existing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system in Bldg. 1805 onboard Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan.  Manufacturer is Toshiba Corporation.

Award to any other sources would be impractical since the existing SCADA system is manufactured by Toshiba using proprietary technology.  The SCADA system is used to regulate all 50 Hz and 60 Hz electrical power in Yokosuka, Negishi Housing Complex in Yokohama, and Ikego Housing Complex in Zushi.  Non-compatible units would fail the operational requirements of base electrical system and would result in significant maintenance and repair problems.

Immediate repair of the SCADA operation console is required to ensure the base is ready to meet upcoming Forward Deployed Naval Forces (FDNF) 60 Hz power requirements.  Failure to execute this work could have serious impacts on electrical power plant operations and the ability of Public Works Department Yokosuka to provide reliable electrical power to the FDNF.  Once the work is completed, another operation console for the new cogeneration plant and MILCON power upgrades project will be installed to support CVN arrival in Summer 2008.

SCADA systems of this size are used only at very few facilities in Japan and normally manufactured only when requested by specific customers.  The existing SCADA system was designed by Toshiba to meet Fleet Activities Yokosuka's specific electrical power distribution needs.  Therefore, the procedures for maintenance and repair of the units are very unique.  Even though parts are available from Toshiba, people outside the company would not know how to install them properly.  Inspection and maintenance manuals or the units and technical knowledge of the specific tasks to complete the work are essential to project success.  Improper overhaul by "unauthorized" personnel may result in damages of equipment and losses to the Navy.  For this reason, Toshiba is the only service provider qualified to perform the work.

Any modification to the SCADA require any intricate knowledge of how existing components are tied into and operate on the electrical distribution system.  Since the SCADA system itself is manufactured and maintained by Toshiba, no other company could reasonably be expected to have the requisite knowledge and skills to perform the work.  Technical manuals for the existing equipment (or their written standard operating procedures) are only available to Toshiba personnel and not the public.  These manuals include how to disassemble parts in the right order and how to find defects in disassembled parts.  The units contain components that are non-standard and hard to diagnose by those other than manufacturer.  Finally, the computer software converters are Toshiba-made.  When the work is completed, new SCADA components need to be adjusted in a way that system can continue to function properly.  This work cannot be done without specific experience with Toshiba software, which is proprietary.

Contract completion date is 90 calendar days.

<SUBJECT>PUBLIC SAFETY SOFTWARE DEFINED
<DESC>Responses are due 14  March 2008 PUBLIC SAFETY SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO (PS SDR).  THE GOVERNMENT IS CONDUCTING A SEARCH FOR MULTI-BANDED HANDSET RADIO FOR INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS Description:  As part of a market survey for a build-or-buy determination, SPAWAR System Center Charleston is soliciting a response from potential business sources to provide the Government information related to commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) multi-banded handset radios that would be applicable to supporting an open- architecture Public Safety (PS) communications solution.  SPAWAR currently has a multi-banded open architecture software defined radio test bed called Dynamic Open Architecture Radio System (DOARS), but all hardware was designed for mobile emergency base station bridging operations. The Government is interested in multi-banded handsets with DSP technology, which may be compatible with SPAWAR's DOARS with some minor software modifications to accommodate 2 to 3 of the PS bands (VHF @ 150 - 170, UHF @ 450 - 512, and 800 @ 806 - 824 and 851 - 869 MHz).  Due to very limited Public Safety budgets, SPAWAR Systems Center considers cost a critical decision factor in the build-or-buy determination.  SPAWAR would like to explore the multi-banded frequency management and over-the-air-control of commercial radio handsets without any proprietary road blocks.  Specifically, SPAWAR would like to demonstrate multi-banded communications interoperability to help manage increased communications loading during an emergency situation involving multiple agencies.  DOARS base station would be used to automatically regulate different radio handsets operating in the 3 dominant Public Safety (PS) frequency bands aforementioned. Proposed Handset Requirements: 1) The handset filters, oscillators, etc. should be able to (with minor modification) accommodate full or partial operations in the 3 Public Safety bands (150 - 170, 450 - 512, and 806 - 869 MHz). 2) The radios need to support frequency modulations (FM) with deviations between (15 KHz - 5 KHz). 3) An embedded sub-tone capability selectable between 67 - 250 Hz in tenths of a hertz (similar to Private Line Tone (PLT) used today in Family Talk and Law Enforcement radios) is desirable. 4) All parameters for the handsets would be assigned over-the-air by a DOARS base station provided by SPAWAR.  These parameters are expected to be exchanged via a simple and robust data protocol, by using a Frequency Shift Keyed (FSK) with a bit rate of 2400 bps.  A list of parameters is provided below: List of Potential Parameters: * Frequency, TX (Hz) * Frequency, RX (Hz) * PLT, TX (1/10th Hz) * PLT, RX (1/10th Hz) * Modulation (FSK, FM) * Modulation Information (FSK - 2 tones, FM - deviation in Hz) * Power, TX (dBm) * Handset ID (16 characters, alpha-numeric) 5) The handsets shall be able to register with the DOARS base station on any of the 3 bands using pre-established frequencies that can be entered via an average Windows computer (e.g., 3 control frequencies for each band) and common serial interface like USB. 6) Handsets must be either programmed by the vendor with minimal non-recoverable expenses (NRE) or computer programmable by third party in which case SPAWAR will do the programming and release the source code back to the vendor. Since DOARS is an open architecture, a user programmable software defined radio handset is necessary so vendors with this type of handset are encouraged to respond.  SPAWAR will explore various registration rule sets, multi-channel scanning, priority options, modulation types, encryption, and voice encoding schemes. This is only a request for information about commercial products matching the above generic requirements, but could definitely lead to an order of handsets with positive responses.  These units will be released to Public Safety subject matter experts for field testing.  The Government recognizes the COTS radio may require some development cost, but is not considered to be a major effort.  If satisfactory responses are received, a solicitation may be issued. Firms are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references that support they possess the specification necessary to meet or exceed stated requirements.   Responses shall be submitted to SPAWARSYSCEN, Charleston, ATTN:  David Neumann, Code 56150, (843) 218-5708, P.O. Box 190022, North Charleston, SC 29419-9022, or by electronic mail to dave.neumann@navy.mil by COB 14 March 2008. (Request that name and size of firm be stated in subject line of e-mail message).  Responses must include the following: 1) name and address of firm; (2) size of business, (3) ownership: Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), and/or Woman-Owned; (4) number of years in business; (5) technical capability; (6) affiliate information: parent corporation, joint venture partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime). THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.

ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2

DESCRIPTION OF EVALUATION FACTOR FOR AWARD IN COMMERCIAL ACQUISITIONS

BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing offerors' technical capability will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations.  By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub factors.  All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices.  Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.  Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:

A. Price Evaluation.  Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price.  When applicable, the price evaluation adjustment for HUBZone small business concerns will be applied in accordance with 52.219-4, Notice of Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns, to arrive at the evaluated price.  The price evaluation will document for the offers evaluated under the following subparagraph B, the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.

	B. Technical Acceptability.  Next, the government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals submitted by the lowest priced offerors (usually, the lowest of 5-7 proposals) on a pass/fail basis.  The proposals shall be evaluated against the following factors:

1.	REQUIREMENTS.  

1.1.	Specifications.  The attached table below specifies the original bulb, operating voltage, original military specifications, color required, and emission pattern.  All lights should be rated for the voltages and power types indicated to ensure adequate life cycle of the lights.  However, best fit substitutes for power and color requirements will be considered and their suitability determined by government laboratory evaluation. 
1.2.	Samples of the following:
Original Military Standard Number 	Operating Voltage1  	Original 
Mil Spec 	Color
(See Attachment 2)	Emission Pattern
(See Paragraph 2.4.2)
MS25069-1495	5  282 VRMS	Attachment 3	NVIS Green A	Longitudinal
MS24515-718	1  6 VAC 	Attachment 4	NVIS Green A	Longitudinal
MS18209-327/8/387	5 ? 282 VRMS	Attachment 5	NVIS Green A	Lateral & Longitudinal
	5  282 VRMS	Attachment 5	NVIS Yellow	Longitudinal
	5  282 VRMS	Attachment 5	NVIS Red	Lateral & Longitudinal
MS25231G-313	5 282 VRMS	Attachment 6	NVIS Green A	Longitudinal
MS35478-315	5 282 VRMS	Attachment 7	NVIS Green A	Longitudinal

Notes:
1.  All AC and RMS voltages are 400 Hz
2.  Peak Voltage of 39.5V
1.3.	Dimming.  During the government installation a portion of the sockets will not be dimmed in any manner and operate on 28 VRMS (39.5 peak voltage).  A portion of the lamps will be dimmed using linear voltage variation from 5  28 VRMS (39.5 peak voltage) or 1  6 VAC power with both voltages at 400Hz.  It is desired that the lamps dim comparably to incandescent bulbs connected to the same power supply, but not specifically required. (Note: This dimming capability is a desirable, but not firmly required and is provided as information should a product be available.)  

1.4.	Light Emission Standards.  
1.4.1.	Daylight Readability.  The below procedure will be used to determine daylight readability for the purposes of the CHILLR demonstration.
1.4.1.1.	To simulate direct sunlight illumination, a spotlight will be shined upon the indicator/lamp and the distance from the indicator shall be adjusted to provide 10,000 foot-candle illumination as measured at the indicator.   Observers will then be asked to rate the visibility of the lamp under that condition.  The indicator/lamp should be identifiable to the observer as being illuminated.
1.4.2.	Emission Pattern.  LED light emission patterns differ from incandescent light emissions.  There are two emission patterns that are required and they are described below.
1.4.2.1.	Longitudinal, Lights designated for longitudinal emission pattern should have a viewing angle of 60 degrees from center but not less than 45 degrees from center.  Lights used to illuminate indicators typically require longitudinal light emissions.  The longitudinal pattern is best compared to ?flashlight? illumination.  A zero-degree longitudinal illumination pattern can be compared to a laser while a 90-degree illumination pattern can be compared to a beacon.  
1.4.2.2.	Lateral.  Lights designated for lateral emission pattern should emit light laterally 360 degrees.  The lateral pattern is best compared to lantern illumination.
1.4.3.	NVIS Compatibility.  The below criteria are used to determine NVIS compatibility.
1.4.3.1.	Predominant Wavelength.  The predominant wavelength of the lamps must be in the reduced response portion (450-630 nm) in the NVIS Spectral Response Graph (Attachment 1).  
1.4.3.2.	Spectral Radiance Graph.  Light sources can be characterized by a spectral emission plot showing wavelength (linearly on the X-axis from 400 to 1000 nm) and wattage (logarithmically on the Y-axis).  The predominant output should be in the same 450-630 nm range.  An example is given in Attachment 1.  Even small spikes of wavelengths greater than 630 nm will have adverse affects on NVIS compatibility.
1.4.3.3.	Chromaticity.  Chromaticity is determined by plotting the light?s visible emissions on the CIE 1976 UCS Chromaticity Diagram (Attachment 2).  The dominant wavelength of the light source is plotted to determine if it conforms to defined NVIS color requirements. Chromaticity is required to be within or near the regions specified for the colors identified in Table 1.  Chromaticity deals with the visible appearance of the light.  Lights of the same color should be of the same chromaticity so that when multiple lights of a certain color are illuminated one light does not stand out or become less noticeable due to differences in color.
1.4.3.4.	NVIS Green Radiance.  MIL-STD-3009 requires the vast majority of cockpit displays and indicators to be NVIS Green A in color and have a scaled NVIS radiance of 1.7 x 10-10 NRB or less when scaled to 0.1 foot lamberts.    
1.4.3.5.	NVIS Yellow and Red Radiance.  MIL-STD-3009 allows Warning Signals and the Master Caution Indicator to have a scaled NVIS radiance no greater than 1.4 x 10-7 NRB when scaled to 15 foot-Lamberts.
1.5.	Physical Dimensions.  The overall length and diameter of the lamps must not exceed the overall physical dimensions of the specified original bulbs as described in the military standards in Attachments 3 through 7.  The base portions of the lamp must meet the tolerances listed on the same specifications or pass fit-testing performed by the Government (i.e., the LED lamps must fit into the same sockets as the incandescent bulbs they?re replacing).
1.6.	Compliance.  Documentation of compliance with the requirements and specifications of paragraphs 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 of the attached TRD is highly desired. Compliance with paragraph 2.4 may not be fully achievable with producible items, if this is the case, identification of a best fit substitution will be considered.   
1.6.1.	Compliance Issues.  The government recognizes that submitters may be unable to fully determine the ability of identified lamps to meet the listed standards of Section 2.4.  Due to this fact the government has included the requirement for non-returnable samples in the Performance Work Statement related to this TRD.  AFRL and AMB will evaluate these samples to determine their compliance and/or suitability to meet the stated purpose in paragraph 1.2 of the PWS.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSFE01-08-Q-0001 and is issued as a Request for Quotations.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23.  This acquisition is a total Small Business Set-Aside, utilizing NAICS Code 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a Size Standard of $6.5 million.  This requirement is also subject to the Service Contract Act, Department of Labor Wage Determination 2005-2255 Revision 6 dated July 5, 2007. The description of requirements for the services acquired is as follows: The Vendor shall provide exercise consulting services related to Chemical Emergency Simulations as follows:  INTRODUCTION - EPA is the federal agency responsible for the protection of the environment including protecting against an accidental or deliberate chemical release from a fixed chemical facility.  EPA partners with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other federal agencies under the National Contingency Plan to provide technical assistance and training related to chemical emergency preparedness and response. This training and assistance is frequently delivered to state and local government organizations.
One primary method used to deliver assistance is through the conduct of FEMA/EPA lead chemical emergency simulations including tabletop, functional and full-scale field exercises. Our goal is to conduct several exercise simulations within the next 18 months. The objective of the assistance program is to simulate a medium scale chemical accident and measure the capabilities of multiple agencies. 
Under this program, the details of the exercise scenario are unknown to the participants until the day of the exercise, but EPA reveals the date, time, and location of the exercises to ensure that all of the key participants will be able to attend. The purpose of a tabletop exercise is to test the participants' ability to implement their contingency plans and procedures and thus demonstrate that their capabilities are adequate to prevent or respond to a chemical or terrorist attack.  EPA lead exercises focus on management of the incident and the ability to deal with preparedness related issues.  The government, with assistance from the contractor, chooses the key participants in the exercise, develops the scenario, and evaluates the exercise.  The exercises are meant to test the response to a chemical or terrorist incident by government, industry, and community players as detailed in the National Response Framework (NRF).  
The desired outcome of the exercises is to enhance unified preparedness and response capabilities in New England.  The exercise process will provide a venue for industries to interact with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies and responders, and to learn about one another's security and response plans and organizations. The exercise evaluation provides recommendations to improve preparedness and response capabilities and the evaluations should identify strengths and weaknesses in the players' security and response plans so they can be corrected. 
The exercise facilitator should be professional, poised, and have demonstrated expertise in the field of emergency response operations.  Another outcome of the exercises is to test the ability of the industry and the federal, state, and local law enforcement and responders to manage a major emergency response operation, ensure the safety and health of individuals, rapidly restore service, and manage the security and preparedness related issues associated with the incident.  The Exercise and evaluations should be structured to identify strengths and weaknesses in both the industry's contingency plans and the various agencies' plans.  The federal government has an interest in exploring the preparedness, security and policy issues that may arise during the exercises. 
The following contractor support is required to assist FEMA/EPA in meeting their responsibilities: 1) attend and participate in meetings to discuss and design tabletop, functional and field exercises with fixed industrial facilities and local emergency planning committees (LEPC?s), 2) technical support for the conduct of the exercises, 3) simulation support for the exercises and 4) prepare the exercise after-action-report (AAR).  Specific task requirements, provide technical support for conducting chemical emergency simulations at a facility and location within FEMA/EPA Region I.  The contractor will conduct several exercise simulations within the next 18 months.
This task requires scheduling, designing, conducting, controlling and evaluating the exercise.  The exercise will test the preparedness and security of the facility management team, and other federal, state, and local law enforcement and emergency responders. The contractor will work with government and industry representatives who can give detailed information about the selected industrial facility and procedures and the surrounding area to make the scenario more realistic.  The contractor will assist in the design of the scenario and recommend the degree of other players' involvement. The contractor may use field props, audio visual and computer simulation technology and any other equipment the contractor deems will enhance the realism of the exercise. 
The exercises will be held at locations selected by FEMA/EPA and will last approximately 6 hours, not counting breaks. The contractor will lead participants in responding to the exercise's scenario.  The contractor will give each participant a player's manual (i.e., the notebook for each participant, the contents of which includes information such as the exercise scenario, ground rules, feedback forms, and lessons learned) containing the scenario and other relevant information. At a minimum, the contractor will have an administrative and technical support person at each exercise to take notes on the discussions. The contractor will summarize the exercise for FEMA/EPA soon after it is completed. The contractor will work with FEMA/EPA and the designated facility representatives, to complete the exercise summary and after-action-report.
This requires a brief one page summary (letter or email) to be received by FEMA/EPA within three business days after the end of the drill. After incorporating comments from FEMA, EPA, and all evaluators, the contractor will send the final exercise report to the FEMA Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative, (COTR), for approval before the contractor performs distribution to the exercise participants. 
1: Meetings and Presentations 
The contractor will conduct one introductory presentation, describing the exercise procedure and time line, overall scenario development process, and player identification. Representatives from key participating agencies and organizations will be present at this meeting. The contractor will conduct at least three planning meetings, depending upon the scope of the simulation, with stakeholders to: develop the scenario, finalize player involvement, and to gather visual aids, props and reference material that will add realism to the exercise. The contractor will provide one senior analyst and/or a technical specialist and at least one administrative support specialist to conduct the planning meetings and make the presentation.
2:  Exercise Design.  
The exercise design and delivery process will follow the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) (Available at www.fema.gov).   The contractor will work with FEMA/EPA and other interested parties to research and design the exercise scenario and exercise type. The scenario will include exercise events based on exercise objectives that will be developed at the design meeting. The scenario and event script must be extensive enough to engage all participants. The contractor's research will rely on industry contingency plans, local emergency plans, State and local emergency operations plans, maps, atlases, piping and instrumentation diagrams and building schematics.  As part of the research and scenario development process, the contractor will send a technical specialist to visit the site of the exercise. The contractor will write the player's manual and give a copy to each participant. The manual must include at a minimum: the exercise scenario, a visual representation of the site, ground rules for the participants, feedback forms, and pages to make notes for improvements and lessons learned. 
3.  Exercise Conduct. 
The contractor will send, at a minimum, one facilitator and at a minimum three support specialists to the exercise as agreed upon at the planning meetings. The facilitator will be responsible for ensuring that the exercise play addresses all aspects of the release scenario and that all the players fully participate in the exercise. The facilitator will be responsible for keeping the activities focused on the scenario and insure that all agreed upon field props, audio-visual and computer simulation technologies are utilized properly during the exercise. The facilitator will demonstrate poise, professionalism, and a thorough understanding of the technical aspects of the chemical emergency and terrorism response. 
4. Exercise Evaluation.
Within three business days after the exercise ends, the contractor will send a synopsis of the exercise to FEMA/EPA. The synopsis will summarize how the exercise went, who attended and what issues arose. Within 21 business days of the exercise, the contractor will write and submit to EPA/FEMA, an exercise after-action-report. EPA/FEMA will share the draft report with other interested parties and give comments to the contractor, who will incorporate them into the final exercise after-action-report.  FEMA/EPA will distribute the final report to the participants.  Deliverables:  1. Meeting Minutes. The contractor will draft meeting minutes for each of the meetings attended or conducted. Minutes will be submitted to FEMA/EPA within three business days after the meeting ends.  2. Exercise Players' Manuals. The contractor must write a player's manual for each exercise. The manuals must contain an agenda, the scenario, maps or diagrams, and other helpful information. The contractor will provide a player's manual for each participant in the exercise. The contractor must submit a copy of the player's manual to FEMA/EPA one week before the start of the exercise to enable a review and the incorporation of any necessary changes. The player's manual, after review and any necessary edits are completed, are to be issued to the participants on the day of the drill.  3.  Exercise Synopsis. The contractor must submit to FEMA/EPA a written synopsis of the exercise within three business days of completing the exercise. The report will be in a format approved by FEMA/EPA (HSEEP).  Deliverables shall be submitted to EPA in both electronic and paper format.  4.  Exercise After-Action-Reports. The contractor must submit to EPA/FEMA a written report on the exercise within 21 business days of completing an exercise. The report will be in the format approved by EPA/FEMA and will include a list of participants, the scenario, an evaluation  of the issues discussed, and identification of options for strengthening prevention and response.  5.  Exercise Scenario. The scenario must include exercise events based on exercise objectives. The scenario and event script must be extensive enough to engage all participants. The scenario and event script is to be submitted to EPA/FEMA for approval no less than 10 business days before the area exercise begins. 6.  Exercise Props.  The contractor may be required to supply moulage, and other props such as a smoke generator or pyrotechnics.

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.     It is requested that the Marine Forces Reserve Band commission the composition of a Symphonic Wind Ensemble (Concert Band) work for the Marine Forces Reserve Band.  This request is in keeping with the intent of the Commander, Marine Forces Reserve of musically capturing the spirit of the City of New Orleans in an anthem of rebirth following the Hurricanes of 2005. 

2.     The overview of this project includes musically portraying the city of New Orleans and her people; their shared catastrophe of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, their separation and isolation as they were driven away and displaced throughout the United States, and their return, reunion and rebirth with a resolve to rebuild their city and their future.
3.	Composer should have the following capabilities:
           a.         Experience writing for Military Symphonic Bands.  The difference between military and civilian symphonic bands, is we have fewer Woodwinds (see Instrumentation list below), which the composer will need to take into consideration.

Military Symphonic Band Instrumentation:
       - 3 Flute/Piccolo
       - 5 Bb Clarinet
       - 1 Bass Clarinet
       - 1 Oboe
       - 1 Bassoon
       - 2 Alto Saxophone
       - 1 Tenor Saxophone
       - 1 Baritone Saxophone
       - 7 Trumpets
       - 3 French Horns
       - 3 Tenor Trombones
       - 1 Bass Trombone
       - 1 Euphonium
       - 3 Tubas
       - 5 Percussion (Full Battery)

**Civilian Symphonic Bands are used to having 9-12 Clarinets (where we have only 5), civilians have 5 Flutes, 2 Oboes, 2 Bassoons, etc...   The big difference is the instrumentation make up (listed above) which the Composer needs to know to avoid limitation and maximize our assets.

           b.       An understanding of the history of New Orleans and a working knowledge of the music associated with the city.

           c.       A knowledge of the events associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the damage to New Orleans, the evacuation, and the effects on the people separated from their city.
4.  The cost of this work shall include the following:

           a.       Composition of a Grade V/VI Concert work up to a length of 10 minutes.

           b.       Composer must make on-sight visit to the New Orleans area to:

       		(1)     Meet with the Commander of Marine Forces Reserve

       		(2)     Meet the Marine Forces Reserve Band who will be performing the work, and assess their capabilities and abilities.

       		(3)     Visit the New Orleans Metro area, tour and observe the Hurricane Damage, the areas that are devastated, the areas already recovered, the areas currently rebuilding, and those yet to be recovered.     This visit/tour is essential for the composer to truly capture - what has happened/is currently happening in the composition.

5.     The benefits to the Command and the Community are the community relations outreach project between the Marine Corps and the local areas that our military service and family members are a part of during their tour of duty.  To have this piece of music composed for the city and its people, and debuted by the Band that experienced the same tragedy, will further show and enhance the Military?s support and dedication to their host community.  The Concert event that will debut this composition will gain positive National media attention for the Marine Corps and the Local Community.

6.     The follow-on benefits to the Command are that after the Marine Forces Reserve Band has debuted this work, it will be available world-wide for High Schools, Universities, and Professional Wind Ensembles to perform this piece.     The performance notes of this piece will include that it was commissioned by the Marine Forces Reserve for the City of New Orleans, continuing to pass on the original community relations intent of this work, and further enhancing/maintaining a positive image of the Marine Corps to National/International audiences.

Both broodstock strains will be provided to the hatchery by the NMFS and RIDEM.

Question 41:  Approximately how many minutes of B-roll footage is available for these projects?  Answer 41:  Over 10 hours of b-roll footage is available, but MCC staff will help narrow down the footage.  

Question 42:  Can we assume the optional 8 minute ?infomercial? would be the same scope as the first infomercial?
Abswer 42:  Yes. 

Question 43:  Under Description, #1, there is no mention of shooting for the 1-2 minute DVD. Will it consist entirely of MCC-provided b-roll footage with narration?
Answer 43:   MCC will provide b-roll.  Vendor needs to provide script with a person doing voice overs.  

Question 44:  Under Description, #2, there is mention of a ?crew to interview MCC officials??would this be the only original footage shot, with the rest to consist of MCC provided b-roll?
Answer 44:  Yes. 

Question 45:  Under Description, #3, regarding ?live onsite webcasting or delayed webcasting,? Are these events all in the Washington DC area or should the contractor anticipate travel?
Answer 45:  All in DC. 

Question 46:  What is the average duration of the live webcasting events (half-day or full-day)? Answer 46:  MCC?s public events usually last 1.5-2 hours (not including the vendors? travel and setup/takedown time).  

Question 47:  Under Deliverables, the first deliverable (initial cut) for the 1-2 minute DVD commercial is due ?5 days after contract award.? Is this correct? In our experience, this would not be enough time to kickoff the contract, write a script, review b-roll, record narration, and edit to the rough cut stage, even under a tightly compressed schedule.
Answer 47:  We would like to stick to the 5 day schedule.  MCC staff is committed to helping the vendor complete the product by this timeline by reviewing the deliverables and proving comments quickly.  

Question 48:  Under description # 3, regarding providing equipment, i.e. ?Mackie?,  can you verify the webcasting events provide in-house audio for live on-site audience?  In other words, would awardee be responsible for providing audio to anyone other than web audience?
Answer 48:  Usually the location of the outreach events has only ONE mult outlet for the house audio, thus MCC needs vendor to have a Mackie board so that others may plug in.  Example, if TV or radio outlets such as VOA cover the event, we will need for them to plug into the vendor?s Mackie board.  Also, we usually have a transcription company plug into the makie board.
