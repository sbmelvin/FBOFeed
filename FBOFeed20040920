<SUBJECT>R -- Integration of the GMDN and the UMDNS device nomenclature systems into the CDRH product code classification
<SOLNBR>223-04-6051
<RESPDATE>060604
<CONTACT>Hamilton Brown, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7043, Fax (301) 827-7101, Email hbrown@oc.fda.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) to award a contract on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) to ECRI, 5200 Butler Pike, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462-1298. 

CDRH has determined that it is necessary to adopt the Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN) into its current product nomenclature system and to harmonize the Universal Medical Device Nomenclature System (UMDNS), GMDN, and CDRH device classification systems. The GMDN is a system of names, definitions, and codes for medical device products. The UMDNS is also a terminology system for medical devices used internationally. In addition, the U.S. National Library of Medicine incorporates the UMDNS into its Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Integrating both the GMDN and the UMDNS systems into the CDRH product classification will provide device naming conventions, definitions and terms for currently marketed devices (real world), dedicated maintenance resources, a thesaurus, and device nomenclature harmonization with key nations

The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS), a public advisory body to the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the area of health data and statistics, expressed the need for commitment to the concept of one truly international medical device nomenclature system to Secretary Thompson in January 2004.

In order to meet the recommendation of the NCVHS to the Department, CDRH needs to immediately start working on the mapping of the three data structures. The UMDNS and GMDN system each have about 6,700 concepts and over 17,000 terms, organized in a hierarchical structure.  In order to map the large number of concepts and terms in the desired timeframe, it is mandatory that the organization responsible for the mapping have an in-depth understanding of how an international device nomenclature is developed and functions.  To FDA’s knowledge, ECRI (formerly the Emergency Care Research Institute) is the only company that has developed and maintains a medical device nomenclature that is used internationally.  That type of experience is required for the work that FDA needs to accomplish. Device nomenclature is significantly different from other health nomenclatures such as the one used for drugs.  ECRI is the U.S. based non-profit health services research agency that developed and maintains the UMDNS system. UMDNS is a standard international nomenclature for medical devices and has been officially adopted by many nations, as well as by the entire European Union (EU). It is used regularly by thousands of healthcare institutions worldwide and the U.S. National Library of Medicine also incorporates UMDNS into its Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).

ECRI is also the only group that has an intimate knowledge of all three nomenclature systems, the UMDNS, GMDN and FDA structures.  ECRI has many years of experience specifically with these device nomenclatures. The GMDN system is based in large part on an early version of the UMDNS. ECRI has been working with FDA for a number of years and agreed in 1997 to harmonize both UMDNS and FDA's device classification system.  A history of input into the development and a good understanding of the three different nomenclatures is a  prerequisite to the effective and efficient mapping and consolidation  of the different systems. In addition, because of ECRI’s extensive work in identifying, processing, filing, storing, retrieving, transferring, and communicating data about medical devices they are the solitary source of information regarding the development of international nomenclature business rules which will be needed to continue the development of new nomenclature.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with ECRI as the only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ). Sources interested in this requirement must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received at hbrown@oc.fda.gov within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information.  All responses received in a timely manner will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a one-year extension to the Safety and Mission Assurance (S&MA) Mission Services Contract, NAS8-00179, with Hernandez Engineering, Inc. (HEI). The existing cost-plus-award-fee contract has a period of performance from October 1, 2000, through September 30, 2005. This one-year action will extend services through September 30, 2006. The services contemplated for the one-year extension fall within the scope of the existing statement of work. These services include the overall S&MA support to provide the necessary management, personnel, equipment, and supplies to provide mission services associated with the planning, implementation, and assessment of safety, reliability, maintainability, quality assurance, and risk management programs for the MSFC Safety and Mission Assurance Directorate. The services include the overall S&MA support to the Space Shuttle Program (SSP), the International Space Station (ISS) Program, the Constellation Systems/Exploration Program, the Project Prometheus, to all Government-furnished equipment developed at MSFC, to both SSP and ISS hardware and operations, and to SSP, ISS, and Expendable Launch Vehicle payloads. The services also include real-time support as required in the MSFC Huntsville Operations Support Center, reviewing in-flight anomalies, and assuring that resolution of anomalies does not violate S&MA requirements and represents a safe course of action for the program(s).  NASA/MSFC intends to extend the existing contract with HEI supported by a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1).  The increased risks associated with HEI and S&MA personnel attempting to support critical Return to Flight (RTF) and re-competition activities at the same time are unacceptable. Only the incumbent is uniquely situated to satisfy the Government's requirements within this timeframe without increasing program risk to unacceptable levels associated with initiating re-competition activities while critical Space Shuttle RTF activities are ongoing and relying heavily upon the services provided by HEI and S&MA civil servant personnel. Postponing the re-competition for one year and continuing to obtain support services from HEI during the RTF period will mitigate program risk. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  See note 22. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 5, 2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<CONTACT>Debra Wright, Agency Administrator, Phone 202-622-2709, Fax 202-622-2343, Email debra.wright@do.treas.gov
<DESC>ELECTRIC POWER MANAGEMENT ADVISOR.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Technical Assistance (BUDGET Team) is competitively recruiting one individual to serve as Electric Power Management Advisor to the Ministry of Energy, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The term of the Advisor position is a one year personal services contract, with the possibility of a time extension.  The Advisor will reside in Kinshasa.

   In some cases, the Office of Technical Assistance would be willing to negotiate a reimbursable agreement with the current employer of the prospective Advisor in order for the selected candidate to maintain unbroken service with his/her long-term employer.

The objective of the Advisor is to maximize economic and financial benefits from the Inga Dam, a 44,000 megawatt hydroelectric complex on the Congo River, located approximately 150 miles from Kinshasa.  Currently, the complex is producing 740 MW of energy, far below its potential.  The dam complex is managed by SNEL, a state-owned corporation.

The Minister of Energy has requested an Advisor to assist the Ministry of Energy develop strategies for the generation, transmission and distribution of energy produced at Inga.  Specifically, the Minister requested assistance with the following issues: 
•	Evaluate proposals for development of generation and     transmission facilities at Inga
•	Research the energy needs of sub-Sahara Africa
•	Develop pricing models for the export of electricity
•	Identify potential sources of investment finance, including joint ventures
•	Develop marketing and promotion strategies
•	Prepare plans for training Ministry staff

The advisor will also recommend measures to promote private investment in the Inga Dam complex and related transmission infrastructure.  

The Advisor will report directly to the Minister of Energy.  It is anticipated that the advisor will interact on a daily basis with other officials of the Ministry as necessary and appropriate.  

The Advisor will be a member of the US Mission to the DRC, and thus will receive equivalent family services due US diplomatic staff, including security, housing, health, education for dependent children, and commissary.  The Advisor will be a member of the Budget Team of the Office of Technical Assistance.

Qualifications:  Candidates are expected to have senior-level experience in two or more of the bulleted functions cited above, with a working knowledge of additional bulleted items.  Therefore, the candidate may have an engineering, economic, finance or marketing background, but must have experience outside of his/her area of specialization.   Because the scope of work of the Advisor is very broad, the Advisor will be expected to identify needs for additional expert assistance within the Advisor’s scope of work.  Experience must be gained with a generator and/or marketer of hydropower.  While not required, overseas experience in developing countries and proficiency in French are preferred. Applicants must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.     

Salaries and Benefits: Salaries are negotiated in accordance with program regulations, based on demonstrated salary history and the skills required. The salary ranges from $85,000 to $145,600. Successful applicants will be subject to a background investigation at the appropriate level. Overseas benefits are provided as allowed by federal regulations.

This announcement is open until November 1, 2004.  Applicants should submit a cover letter, resume or OF-612 by e-mail to: tgray@ota.treas.gov or by mail to: U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Technical Assistance, Attn: Recruitment Coordinator, 740 15th Street, N. W., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20220.     Please reference Solicitation Number A04-035 on your cover letter, resume or OF-612.

Appworx was written by Appworx Corp and is the only known source for maintenance.  The software has been used for over 10 years and any substitutions would require a complete overhaul of the scheduling system and would halt a mission-essential function during that overhaul.  Replacement of this software would require a change of the current system configuration to be compatible with the new software. 
 Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.   No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The USDA, Farm Service Agency intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to Dr. Thomas King to perform consultation services as required by the following Statement of Work.

STATEMENT OF WORK - PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE WITH TRIBAL CONSULTATION UNDER SECTION 106 OF THE NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT 

PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOW is to identify the tasks necessary for providing assistance with tribal consultation to the Farm Service Agency (FSA) as the agency develops statewide agreements under the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). The consultation is specifically required under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), its implementing regulations and other statutes and Executive Orders.  CREP is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).
 
BACKGROUND
CCC programs including the Conservation Reserve Program, Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, Pasture Recovery Program, Farm Storage Facility Loan Program, and price support program are subject to NHPA and NAGPRA provisions.  Under Section 106 of NHPA, CCC program payments, loans or contracts, including CREP statewide agreements would have to go through the time consuming historic preservation review, evaluation, consultation and mitigation process.  Consulting with tribal entities is done on a government-to-government basis.  FSA has no experience in entering into tribal consultation and requires the assistance of an expert to provide guidance and advice, review documents, and provide background and information on tribal customs and protocols. 

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
FSA has entered into contracts with reputable environmental firms to research and analyze the potential environmental impacts of the CREP agreements, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  Historic preservation and cultural resources reviews are incorporated into the NEPA review process.  

Under regulations at 36 CFR 800, agencies have a unique legal relationship with Indian tribes as set forth in the United States Constitution, treaties, statues, and court decisions.  Consultation with tribes should be conducted in a sensitive manner respectful of tribal sovereignty.  Since agencies cannot delegate consultation, the contractors conducting the NEPA review are not authorized to consult as required by NHPA.  

Consultation assistance is required for the following environmental assessments:
• Tribes associated with the California CREP in the North Central Valley’s nine counties: Butte, Colusa, Glenn, Placer, Sacramento, Solano, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba.
• Tribes associated with the Idaho CREP in the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer counties: Blaine, Elmore, Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, and Minidoka 
• Montana CREP affects the Fort Belnap Tribe
• North Dakota CREP affects the Three Affiliated Tribes and Stranding Rock Sioux Tribe
• Tribes associated with the Oregon CREP area of Coastal and Columbia Basins and the Tualatin Watershed
• Yakama Nation 

SCOPE OF SERVICES 
Services will include
• Assisting with identifying relevant tribes in each state that may be interested in the CREP program;
• advising the agency on the appropriate method and tone of consultation; 
• providing information on tribal customs and traditions that may affect consultation;
• recommending negotiation items and methods; 
• reviewing any culturally related sections of the environmental assessments;  
• working in conjunction with the contracted EA schedules;
• identifying individuals and tribal representatives who have an interest in the CREP EAs; and  
• assisting the State Environmental Coordinators with their consultation needs.

These services will be provided for each of the six EAs being prepared.  The contractor will work directly with FSA and not the environmental firm preparing the EAs.  

The ID and CA EAs should be awarded by the end of September.  Once awarded, the preliminary draft of each PEA will be due to FSA 45 days after award.  The draft of each will be due 15 days after contractor receives FSA comments on the preliminary draft.  Each draft will be published for public comment for a minimum of 30 days.  The final PEAs will be due to FSA no later than 15 days after the close of public comment.  The final PEAs and FONSI will be published for a minimum of 30 days.

The MT, ND and OR EAs were awarded July 29, 2004.  The preliminary draft PEA will be due to FSA 45 days after award.  The draft will be due 15 days after contractor receives FSA comments on the preliminary draft.  The draft will be published for public comment for a minimum of 15 days.  The final PEA will be due to FSA no later than 15 days after the close of public comment.  The final PEA and FONSI will be published for a minimum of 15 days. 

The Yakima Nation CREP EA was awarded on August 24, 2004 and is due 160 days after award.

TIME FRAMES
The project should be completed by within one year of notice to proceed.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is in the process of requesting Proposals (RFP) for renovations to the Federal Building / Post Office  located at 657 Second Avenue North, Fargo, North Dakota.  GSA is soliciting contractors to participate in the “Best Value Source Selection” process for this project.  This process has been set aside for procurement under the Small Business Administration’s 8(a) Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Step One requires the offeror and major subcontractors (Electrical only) to submit a technical proposal, without pricing.  Each Offeror must be a general contractor, and each offeror must submit between two (2) and four (4) major subcontractors. Following evaluation of the Technical Proposals, the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) shall make a Competitive Range determination that will include all offerors considered to have a reasonable probability of being selected for award.  All  offerors will be allowed to continue in the Source Selection process, however, those that fall outside of the competitive range will be notified that the SSEB has determined that they do not have a reasonable probability of award.  Step Two of this procedure will require the submission of priced proposals and management plans.  Following a final evaluation of the Price and management proposals, the SSEB shall determine which offeror to award the contract to based upon its Best Value analysis.

The following is a brief description of the construction.  This project consists of all labor, equipment, material, transportation, and supervision necessary to complete this renovation.  The building was constructed in Fargo in 1969 and contains 4 stories, a basement, and a penthouse and provides a gross area of 24,121 square meters (259,635 square feet) to house approximately 404 employees.  There are 31 structured parking spaces within the building and 115 surface parking spaces in a lot adjacent to the building.  The major tenant in this building is the U.S. Postal Service, occupying 45% of the building.  Other tenants include the Internal Revenue Service, Small Business Administration, Social Security Administration, Congressional Offices, and GSA operations.  The General Construction Contractor shall be professionally licensed in the State of North Dakota.  The project will generally consist of the following scope of work: major upgrade of the electrical system, repair and replace elevators, replace and re-grade paving, complete window replacement, fire protection upgrade, handicapped accessibility upgrades, security enhancements, interior alterations, exterior façade repairs, and improvements to the postal dock.  Warranties/guarantees, finishes and related management requirements will be included.  Portions of the work, especially in occupied tenant spaces, will have to be performed during non-working hours.  Total project construction costs, including all designated Government allowances, are estimated to be in the range of $5 Million to $6 Million.  The design was prepared by the architectural firm of ACLP Architecture of Denver, Colorado.

<DESC>Engineering Field Activity Northeast (EFANE), Naval Facilities Engineering Command is seeking qualified 8(a) firms to develop a pool of firms for an 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).  This solicitation is restricted to 8(a) firms having SBA approved bona fide offices within the geographical boundaries of one of the following SBA District Offices:  Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, Syracuse or Buffalo.
 
A Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) is not a contract but rather a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between the Engineering Field Activity, Northeast (EFANE) and an 8(a) contractor that contains (1) the terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the basic ordering agreement.  

Use of the BOA will allow the Navy to expedite contracting for construction and repairs at various locations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Delaware.  The types of work being considered for procurement under this BOA includes new construction, renovations, alterations, repairs, minor construction and maintenance work and demolition projects (NAICS Codes beginning with 236, 237 and 238).  In order to be eligible an 8(a) firm must be considered a small business pursuant to the applicable NAICS code.  The small business size standard for NAICS sector 236 is $28.5 million, NAICS sector 237 is $28.5 million (except Dredging) and NAICS sector 238 is $12.0 million

The majority of task orders under this agreement are expected to be in the $25,000 to $1,000,000 range however individual task orders as large as $3,000,000 are possible.  The Navy may place design-build projects under this BOA.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under this agreement nor is there any assurance of a steady stream of work.  Nothing in this BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only.

Under the BOA, firms will compete on task orders for construction and construction related requirements.  BOA holders serviced by the SBA District where the work is to be performed will be provided the first opportunity to provide bids on the work.  However, if sufficient competition does not exist, the area of consideration may be expanded with SBA concurrence.  Each Task Order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.  

Joint Venture 8(a) firms may respond to this solicitation and may be issued a BOA if they meet SBA joint venture requirements.  EFA Northeast shall only accept bids/proposals from a joint venture for individual Task Orders placed under the resultant BOA, if that joint venture firm is already a BOA holder. 

The BOA will remain in effect for three years.  The Contracting Officer will open the BOA program for new applicants once a year or more often, if deemed necessary. To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm shall be required to meet the following administrative and technical criteria.  

The administrative criteria are: (1) SBA 8(a) certification and a bona fide place of business in one of the above listed SBA Districts, (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov/, (3) provide a letter from their Surety verifying their “bondability” and current aggregate bonding and single project limit, (4) Be listed in SBA's Dynamic Small Business Search (formally ProNet) at http://dsbs.sba.gov/dsbs/dsp_dsbs.cfm,

Technical criteria:  Each firm shall demonstrate the ability to successfully meet construction needs with timely delivery of services at reasonable prices.  Offerors shall be required to provide:  (1) References on completed projects (maximum of three) and (2) qualifications including resumes for Key Personnel.  The evaluation of an offeror’s technical capability will be a subjective assessment based on a review of the documentation submitted by the offeror.  The Government’s evaluation of the quality and success of the offeror’s past performance will be used to assess the overall probability of successful performance under the BOA.  Firms that meet all of the administrative and technical requirements will be issued a BOA.  
  
Firms wishing to be considered for receipt of a BOA must respond to solicitation number N62472-04-R-8000 that must be downloaded from our Internet web site (ESOL) located at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD), ENERGY STAR Residential Branch (ESRB) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order using the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the Manufactured Housing Research Alliance (MHRA). MHRA is uniquely qualified to develop guidelines for the marketing and installation of ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes due to its detailed knowledge of how the manufactured housing industry  constructs, markets, and installs its homes and the many issues and challenges the industry faces. This knowledge comes from MHRA's manufacturer members, who produce about 80% of all manufactured homes in the U.S. In addition, MHRA is uniquely qualified because it helped develop manufacturing and  quality control procedures that laid the groundwork for what became the guidelines used by all plants to construct ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes. As such, MHRA has an intimate knowledge of the current procedures used by plants to qualify homes for the ENERGY STAR label and the energy  efficiency and building science principles that were used to develop those procedures. It also knows first hand the barriers facing retailers and installers of ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes and what these businesses need to increase the quality and sales of these energy efficient and  affordable new homes. In 2000, with a grant from EPA, MHRA developed technical procedures that later laid the groundwork for what became the procedures for constructing ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes. Leveraging the industry's existing quality control and inspection systems, the  procedures were adopted by EPA and converted into ENERGY STAR program protocols. The purpose of this acquisition is to develop technical guidelines for marketing and installing ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes and for sizing cooling equipment for these homes. The main objective of this work  is to increase the market penetration and quality of ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes by developing and disseminating guidelines that provide information on how to successfully market and install these homes. The target audience for these guidelines will be manufactured home retailers and  installers. The NAICS code for this procurement will be 541620. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received by the closing date of this  announcement, will be considered and given adequate evaluation. Responses to this posting SHALL be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions or inquiries should be directed to Tom  Semones via email at Semones.Tom@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The grout bags are to extend a minimum o f 15 downstream from the face of the dam and be in contact with the dam at a slope no greater than 2 Horizontal to 1 Vertical.  Pipes will be installed in between the grout bags to allow for secondary grouting that will fill the voids between the grout ba gs.  This will require that flow be diverted from the area of grout placement to prevent turbulence from interfering with placement operations.

<DESC>The synopsis entitled Safety and Mission Assurance (S&MA) Mission Services Contract, which was posted on September 10, 2004, is hereby cancelled.	A NAICS code of 541710 for Research and Development should have been utilized for this synopsis rather than 541330 for Engineering Services.  Procedures do not allow for a change to be made to the NAICS code via a modification to the synopsis.  As a result, MSFC plans to issue a new synopsis under reference number 4200081819-Rev1.  Please note the description for the new synopsis is the same as that utilized this synopsis, except for the fact that the last sentence of fourth paragraph (which reads, "NASA/MSFC has every intention of conducting a Full and Open Competition for the follow-on procurement to this one-year extension.") has been deleted.

Position Title: Intermittent Health Advisor, USAID, Albania. 
Final Compensation will be based upon the market value for the position, the individual's salary and work history, experience and educational background.

Market Value: $73,335.00 -96,637.00
Period of performance: Two (2) years
Place of performance: Tirana, Albania
Supervisory controls: The incumbent will report to the Mission Director or his designee.

Statement of Duties

A. Background:  

USAID manages development and transition programs in Albania, financed through Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) funds.  Total SEED assistance for Albania is about $28 million annually, of which USAID/Albania manages roughly $21.5 million.  In addition to the Director, the Mission is staffed with three Direct Hires (USDHs), six US Personal Service Contractors (USPSCs), and 16 Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs).  The Mission’s Strategic Plan is organized around a Results Framework containing five strategic objectives (SOs), which link with E&E Bureau goals for: economic restructuring (SO 1.3); strengthened democracy and civil society (SO 2.1); rule of law (SO 2.2); selected primary health care services in targeted areas (SO 3.1); and, special initiatives (SO 4.1).

With regard to health sector reform in Albania, the last decade has confirmed a lesson for government decision-makers that should have been obvious but rarely seems to be: That making health services widely available helps in moving forward economic and democratic progress by increasing society’s productive capacity, strengthening the formation of a robust civil society and building people’s trust in the benefits of democracy and free-market economies. 

In Albania, although the government of Albania has declared health as one of the top priorities for its current development program, the health share of public expenditures is unfortunately extremely low (only 1,6% of GDP for the past three years compared to 2,9% in 1989, near the end of communist rule ) and represents, ironically, a declining commitment to health, despite the  significant demographic and epidemiological changes that are occurring.
 
In a climate where numerous problems such as organized crime, trafficking in persons, money laundering, environmental degradation, ineffective rule of law, weak and poorly performing economies, are dominating problems, investing in people has become a step child of the government. 
  
Albania faces a reality where infant and child morbidity and mortality figures are among the highest in the whole region and the abortion rate is still unacceptably high. Life expectancy, which used to be one of the highest in the region, has significantly declined, and the threat of HIV/AIDS as well as a TB epidemic is rapidly increasing.
 
People’s perceptions and trust in their health system’s ability to deal with their problems are very low and continually declining.  The old state–funded health system struggles to survive in an environment where funding has evaporated, policy is either non-existent or ineffective, and a functional privatized system is far from being a reality.

In addition, other constraints cannot be overlooked such as a lack of vision, a lack of long-term planning capacity, and a lack of human resources; dilapidated health facilities’ infrastructure at all levels; corruption and conflict of interests; and non-transparent health financing mechanisms. Addressing this impressive number of constraints will require well coordinated efforts between the donors and the government and demonstrates how important the need is for USAID/Albania’s assistance in health.

By managing for results in health, USAID/Albania has had to seek resource efficiencies that have driven the Mission to consolidate a number of important activities to address the above. Because of the pressures on the Mission’s budget resources, the focus is on primary health care reform The Mission wants a balanced allocation of resources for primary health care and to create a transparent system that will address all forms of corruption, beginning with reducing “under the table” payment for access and better service for health dispensary consultations.


B. Basic Function of the Position:  

The incumbent will serve intermittently as a Health Adviser (HA) to the health SO team and will provide program guidance and support for the design, strategy development, implementation, monitoring and results reporting of the health portfolio. The Health Advisor will provide technical guidance to the FSN Health Officer as needed, assist her produce technical inputs to Mission-wide exercises at important times during each fiscal year, and be a mentor. The Health Advisor will perform the work during a succession of six TDYs, over the course of two years and must have a flexible travel schedule.  Each TDY will be for a specific task and its duration will be determined by the nature of the task.  As required, the Health Advisor will serve as a virtual member of the SO Health team to ensure maximum program impact with available resources. 

C. Major Duties and Responsibilities:

The intermittent Health Advisor will serve as an expert advisor and technical authority on health activities.  

Serves as an expert advisor and technical authority on complex and, often, precedent-setting policy and activity issues, helping develop policies, strategies and plans for the development assistance program for the Mission Health team and implementing partners. Incumbent will provide specialized expertise to the Health team in designing and monitoring policies, strategies, and programs. Incumbent will provide technical advice, guidance, and support to the Health team on technical and related program issues regarding the design, implementation, management, and evaluation and monitoring of activities. S/he will provide expert advice and state-of-the-art professional assistance and support on policy, activity and SO portfolio implementation planning issues in development assistance. 

In particular, the Advisor will assist the Health Officer prepare the Health inputs for the Annual Report and the Mission’s annual portfolio review, the PRA.  During the Mission’s updating of the Country Strategy Plan, the advisor will provide assistance as needed.  Other foreseeable times input from the Advisor that will be needed will include, but not be limited to, the development of the Mission’s HIV/AIDS strategy, revisions to the performance monitoring plan, Mission inputs into regional health initiatives, assistance to the implementing partners on their work plans, and preparing close out reports. When the Health Officer is on leave or away on training, the Health Adviser will be needed to provide coverage.  There will be times when the Adviser will provide assistance virtually. 

Advisor will assist the Health team in developing or modifying annual procurement plans and in adjusting the design of new/ongoing activities, as appropriate. Advisor will assist the Health team in the design and oversight of sectoral and multi-sectoral assessments and special topic analyses. 

The incumbent should maintain knowledge of current literature in order to advise Health Officer to facilitate and coordinate activities in selected health development assistance areas.

<DESC>Bureau of Customs and Border protection (CBP) the Department of Homeland Security(DHS) is seeking industrry interest and infromation on a requirement for a lowercost version of hand held land Mobile Radios. DHS has several LMR networks are national in extent and scope. These networks operate in the VHF range of 162 To 174 MHz. The systems function with repeaters mounted on towers, providing extended coverage in a particular geographic area. Each radio can communicate with other users either by way of the nearest repeater or directly with other radios. The current LMR is simmular to many public safety hand held radios and is of approximate dimention 6.5"X2,5"X1.5" with an 8.5 " monopole antenna. The govermnent is seeking alternative solutions that can provide the following minimum subset of the performance capabilities of current LMR, but at a significantly lower cost.

*  Frequency 162-174 MHz
*  4 channel capable of digital opertions and APCO-25 Compliant.
*  Current DES FIPS-140 certified encryption with potential for   upgrade to AES capability by Decemeber 2004.
*  Current or potential for upgrade to OTAR capability by December 2004.
*  5W transmit power.
* 8 Hour battery charge (80-10-10 duty cycle).
* Commercial ruggedized (not required military specifications)
 The goverment will consider any alternatives regardless of size that can meet the above capabilities and provide effective communications via a hand held device. Vendor discretion will determin internal funtions such as processing methods, schemes, etc. 

There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.

<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for the Ground-Based Studies for Radiation Biology and Radiation Shielding Materials NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NNH04ZUU005N NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop proposals for the Ground-Based Studies for Radiation Biology and Radiation Shielding Materials (NNH04ZUU005N) NRA. Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) released a NRA entitled, Ground-Based Studies for Radiation Biology and Radiation Shielding Materials (see http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_u/nra/current/NNH04ZUU005N/index.html ).	This NRA solicits ground-based research for the novel shielding and multi-functional materials:  NASA is supporting research to develop new multi-functional materials that provide effective radiation shielding while being suitable for the fabrication of system components needed for these missions. This NRA solicits proposals that address the design, synthesis, processing, fabrication, and testing (including accelerator-based testing) of multi-functional materials. These materials must be suitable for fabrication of one or more components of crewed space vehicles, rovers, habitats, or spacesuits. Use of these materials must make a significant contribution to reducing the mass of the system for which they are intended. Proposals addressing questions associated with the cost, processing, efficiency, safety, etc. associated with the manufacturing of known or potential shielding materials are also sought by this NRA. In addition, this NRA solicits proposals for computational tools to assess the radiation shielding effectiveness of materials.  In particular, proposals for the analysis of relevant existing cross section or yield measurements, and new measurements that will test the event generators used in transport codes that employ Monte Carlo techniques, new cross section and yield measurements of neutron emission, transverse and/or longitudinal momenta for a variety of projectile and target combinations are of interest. NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the Ground-Based Studies for Radiation Biology and Radiation Shielding Materials NRA to develop proposals and execute the development and validation of predictive assessment tool(s) and/or the development of material systems.  Subject to the availability of funds, selected partner proposal(s) would result in the development and validation of predictive assessment tool(s) and/or the development of material systems contract(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to develop and validate predictive assessment tools consistent and/or to develop and test material systems with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel - This criteria evaluates the proposers relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control - This criterion evaluates the proposers ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities - This criterion evaluates the proposers facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. The proposer should specify which LaRC research proposal(s) they are addressing. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria.  Your responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Lisa.C.Simonsen, Mail Stop 202, Building 1229, Room 202, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: Lisa.C.Simonsen@nasa.gov.  Procurement related questions should be directed to: Nancy M. Sessoms, Contracting Officer 757-864-2471 Nancy.M.Sessoms@nasa.gov  The due date for submission is 4:00 p.m. local time October 1, 2004. The following LaRC research proposals are seeking partnerships. The technical requirements and NASA LaRC point of contact for questions are provided below: (1)  Weight Windows Variance Reduction Technique for the HETC Monte Carlo Code; Technical point of contact: Robert C. Singleterry, Jr. (email: robert.c.singleterry@nasa.gov) Phone: 757-864-1437. LaRC is looking for partners to implement a weight windows variance reduction technique into the HETC Monte Carlo particle simulation code.  Currently, the weight windows technique is the most robust variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo simulations.  With this technique, better statistics can be generated faster than without the technique.  When HETC is utilized for Galactic Cosmic Ray simulation for spacecraft, run time will increase exponentially; therefore, a variance reduction is mandatory to generate useful results.  The projectiles range from protons to uranium.  The targets will be typical and potential space and aircraft materials.  Particles tracked will include target fragments, neutrons, pions, muons, electrons, and gamma rays along with the primary projectiles and their secondaries. Partners are sought with expertise in various particle transport and particle cross section areas.	This will include an ability to execute a 3D particle transport code in adjoint mode to generate the weight windows for use within HETC.  The cross section generators used in HETC will be used to generate the majority of the cross sections for the adjoint transport code.  Other cross sections must be supplied and integrated into the system.  The ability to implement the weight windows variance reduction into the HETC code is also sought.  The final expertise being sought is to implement the codes in a cluster environment such as a multiple node itanium2 cluster.  LaRC is especially interested in partners that have capability for and experience with conducting focused research and development work toward a demonstration with transport and cross section codes in the galactic cosmic ray mode with the above specified characteristics. (2) Radiation Protective Materials Coating; Technical point of contact: Warren Kelliher. (email: warren.c.kelliher@nasa.gov) Phone: 757-864-4172. LaRC is looking for a partner capable of depositing by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) a layer of Silicon-Oxy-Carbide (SOC) onto various plastics as an out-gassing barrier.  The SOC coatings are to be assessed for use in radiation protective, flexible space structures currently being developed under previously awarded NRA funding.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Small Radioisotope Power Sources for the Space and Defense Power Systems Program
<DESC>Description:     The Department of Energy (DOE) is releasing a Notice of Intent to Issue a Request for Proposal for Small Radioisotope Power Sources. NASAâ€™s plans for future space and planetary surface missions calls for small size spacecrafts, landers and robotics using improved or new radioisotope power systems (RPS).  The improved or new RPS require high system efficiency, long life, low mass and volume, and adaptability for mission use in harsh environments. RPSs have been used for numerous, highly successful space applications, including the Apollo lunar missions, the Viking Mars landers, and the Pioneer, Voyager, Ulysses, Galileo and Cassini outer planetary probes.  In addition to being able to operate independent of orientation to and distance from the Sun, RPSs are typically long-lived, rugged, compact, highly reliable, and relatively insensitive to radiation and other environmental effects.  As such, they are ideally suited for missions involving long-duration, autonomous operations in the extreme environments of space and planetary surfaces. The different RPS units that the U.S. has developed and flown over the years have all provided power levels ranging from ten to several hundred watts. The increased use of smaller spacecraft over the last decade, along with studies of new potential science applications, has suggested the need for RPSs yielding much lower power levels.  Such power supplies have the potential to extend the capability of small science payloads and instruments, and to enable applications such as: Â·  Long-lived meteorological/seismological stations broadly distributed across planetary   surfaces, Â·  Small landers at extreme latitudes or in regions of low solar flux, Â·  Surface and atmosphere-based mobility systems, Â·  Subsurface probes, including impactors and autonomous boring devices, Â·  Deep space micro-spacecraft and sub-satellites. Such units could also find application in future human exploration missions involving use of monitoring stations and autonomous devices, similar to the ALSEP units deployed on the Moon during the Apollo program. Although flight-qualified RPS units in this size and power range do not presently exist, their potential to support a broad range of exploration tasks has led NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE) to consider the development of small RPS units such that they might be available for missions by the early part of next decade.  Starting in 2003, NASAâ€™s Office of Space Science and DOE convened a series of studies and technical interchange meetings to review the potential applications, associated requirements, and methodology for pursuing development of small RPS.  The results of these activities will be documented in a soon to be released report, â€œEnabling Exploration with Small Radioisotope Power Systems.â€ The objective of this RFP will be to design, fabricate and test two different sized (milliwatt and multiwatt) electrically heated engineering generators in order to demonstrate their suitability as radioisotope power systems (RPSs) for NASA space exploration missions during the next decade. The RFP will solicit proposals for a multi-phase effort to develop full-scale engineering units and conduct non-nuclear testing of two different sized units in relevant environments. Â·  Milliwatt RPS Engineering Unit - This RPS will serve as building blocks for power systems on missions with requirements in the range of 10 â€“ 100 milliwatts electric.  The primary technical requirements are long life and high mass and volumetric specific power. Â·  Multiwatt RPS Engineering Unit - This RPS to serve as building blocks for power systems on missions with requirements in the range of one to tens of watts electric.  The power requirement for individual multiwatt units has not been determined at this point, but could range from one to 20 watts electric. Other key technical requirements are long life and high mass and volumetric specific power. Work will be accomplished in a phased approach.  Phase 1, would involve detailed design and evaluation of critical technologies.  Subsequent phase efforts would entail full-scale performance and life tests of the unit. All contracts will be reviewed at the end of each phase and only those with the highest likelihood of success would be continued. DOE is planning to conduct this procurement in the following stages: 1.  RFP (Fall 2004) It is anticipated that DOE will disseminate the formal Request for Proposals electronically through the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) located at the following URL.  http://e-center.doe.gov 2.  Awards (Spring 2005) It is anticipated that DOE will make awards to successful proposers in the spring of FY2005 General Award Information: 1.  DOE anticipates this will be full and open competition and a cost plus fixed fee contract. 2.  It is anticipated that DOE will make one to three awards in each area (Milliwatt & Multiwatt). 3.  It is anticipated that total cost for all work will be up to $9,500,000, with $1,300,000 available for the first year. 4.  It is anticipated that all these projects will be completed within 3 years. If your firm is interested in being notified when the RFP is released, please respond by email to the contract specialist listed below.

NIST DOCKET NUMBER: 04-022

Title: 	FLAIR-DCA - Fine Lightweight Aggregates as Internal Reservoirs for the Delivery of Chemical Admixtures

Description:  	The invention consists of a unique method to control the distribution/delivery of chemical admixtures within a hardening concrete.  Recently, the usage of saturated fine lightweight aggregates to provide internal curing water to promote cement hydration in hardening concrete with a low water to cementitious binder ratio (w/c <=0.42) has been demonstrated in the laboratory and the field.  The novel aspect of this invention is to utilize these same internal reservoirs to supply chemical admixtures such as shrinkage-reducing admixtures, corrosion inhibitors, etc., to the concrete.  As the cementitious components of the concrete react with the mix water, the hydration products occupy less volume than the starting materials.  Thus, a concrete will imbibe water from its immediate surroundings or from internal sources to maintain a saturated capillary porosity.  While to date, the internal reservoirs have been saturated only with water, they could equally be saturated with solutions of chemical admixtures.

	Admixture delivery via these internal reservoirs can offer several advantages over conventional delivery by direct addition to the mixing water.  Some chemical admixtures such as shrinkage-reducing admixtures are partially absorbed by the cement hydration products.  In this case, releasing the majority of the chemical admixture after some of the cement has already hydrated should result in a more efficient usage of the chemical.  This would be the case should FLAIR be used to deliver the chemical admixture.  Secondly, admixture combinations sometimes exhibit detrimental interactions.  An example would be a shrinkage-reducing admixture which decreases the effectiveness of an air entraining admixture.  By introducing the admixture that influences fresh concrete properties (air entrainment, rheology, setting) via conventional means and the admixture that influences hardened concrete properties (corrosion inhibition, shrinkage reduction, ASR mitigation) via the internal reservoirs, these detrimental interactions should be minimized.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations document (FAR) subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number FA4600-04-T-0207 is being issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-18. All applicable provision and clauses are included in the actual solicitation.  This electronic announcement constitutes the only solicitation being issued.  This procurement is set aside 100% for small business.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238330, and the small business size standard is $12M.  The Government intends to issue a firm fixed price purchase contract(s) for the following: 


STATEMENT OF WORK #1 IS AS FOLLOWS:

Statement of Work OFH Basketball Courts


Service:  Install (4) new basketball court surfaces over the top of already existing floors. Also includes painting court lines and fixing volleyball shelves and face plates. 

Job Site:  Offutt Field Houses bldg 321 Offutt AFB NE 68113

Pre-renovation procedures – 
The courts are ready and no real requirements exist or need to occur prior to start of project other than relocation of basketballs and bleachers.  OFH staff will ensure this occurs prior to state of work.

Scope of Work:  replace playing court surfaces on (4) basketball courts at OFH.  The new floor surfaces can be installed over the existing area.  The floors should have a concrete base (which already exists).  The courts should be covered with a sleeper system and a hardwood surface.  Maple tongue and groove and pressure treated beech are the recommended requirements for playing court surface.  Courts must adhere and meet DIN standards (Deutsches Intitut fur Normung).  These standards require that a floor meet six criteria:
1.	Shock absorption-a floor’s ability to reduce the impact of contact with the floor surface.  The greater the shock absorption, the more protective it is because it reduces impact forces.  
2.	Standard vertical deformation – the actual vertical deflection of the floor upon impact.  The greater the deformation, the more the floor deflects downward.  Floors with minimal deformation are not good at absorbing impact forces.
3.	Deflective indention- the actual vertical deflection of the floor at a distance 50 cm from the point of impact.  The greater the indentation, the more likely impact at one spot will cause deflection at a distant point.
4.	Sliding characterists- the surface friction of the finished floor. A floor with poor sliding characteristics would be inappropriate for aerobics or basketball.
5.	Ball reflection – (game action response) the response of a ball dropped on the floor compared to a ball dropped on the concrete.
6.	Rolling Load – a floor’s ability to withstand heavy weight without breaking or sustaining permanent damage. 
The DIN criteria are then used to evaluate the effectiveness of a floor.  A floor will have one of three functions:
1.	Sports function – a floor that serves a sports function enhances athletic performance.  Surface friction and ball reflection are important here.
2.	Protective function – a floor that serves a protective function reduces the risk of injury (e.g. from a fall) during activity.  Shock absorption is important here.
3.	Material technical function – a floor that serves a material – technical function meets the sports and protective functions.

In a health/fitness facility, the gymnasium and multipurpose floors are classified under sports function or material technical function.  The aerobics floor is classified under the protective function, with some sports function characteristics.

A floor surface that has a material technical function should meet the following DIN criteria:
Shock absorption			53% minimum
Standard vertical deformation 	2.3 mm minimum
Deflective indentation			15% maximum
Sliding characteristics			0.5 to 0.7 range
Ball deflection				90% minimum
Rolling load				337.6 lb

Court dimensions: 94 ft x 50 ft, with a 10 ft unobstructed space on all sides (3 ft minimum).  The color of the lane space marks and neutral zone should contrast with the color of the bounding lines.  The mid court marks should be the same color as the bounding lines.  All lines should be 2-in wide (neutral zone excluded).  All dimensions are to inside edge of lines except where noted.  

Volleyball court markings:  recommended size of a volleyball court is 30 ft x 60 ft with a 10 ft unobstructed area on all sides (6 ft minimum). All measurements for court markings are to the outside of the lines except for the centerline. All court markings to be 2 – in wide, except as noted.  Net height at center should be as follows: men’s 8 ft 0 inches, women 7 ft 4 inches.  

2 courts are to only have basketball markings, 1 court should have both basketball and 2 side by side volleyball markings as well as shelves and face plates to cover openings in floor, 1 court is to only have side by side volleyball court markings, shelves and face plates.

All courts should have two (2) coats of seal and two (2) coats finish. 

Courts will be located slightly above ground and will not be flush with existing elevation it will require a transition ramp/grade/slope from new surface level to existing level.  At one end of each court must provide wheelchair access and ramp.

Contractor will be required to clean up all fine dust and materials involved in development and construction of courts.

STATEMENT OF WORK #2 IS AS FOLLOWS:

Statement of Work (2) for Aerobic rooms OFH & Frady Fitness Center

Service: Remove existing carpeting and padding from each aerobic room at OFH and Frady Fitness Center and replace with new sprung flooring.

Job Site:  Offutt Field House, bldg 321 and Frady Fitness Center, bldg 305 Offutt AFB NE 68113

Pre-renovation Procedures – Fitness Staff will remove all supplies and equipment from each area so work space has ease of access and is free of equipment and materials.

Scope of work:
Contractor must remove all existing carpet, cove base and sub base materials from both facilities. 

Existing door will need to be cut and raised as well as wall coverings due to the addition of new flooring. Contractor will ensure there is a smooth transition in and out of rooms to existing hallway floors.  Will need to ensure all fire codes are meet and adhered too. 

All existing carpet, padding and other waste materials need to be removed from facility and placed in dumpster.  Contractor will ensure area is clean and free of debris, dirt and materials upon completion of work.  

The floor must consist of a hardwood sprung floor which meets the criteria outlined below in DIN standards.  Please note the reference made under protective function which is the requirement for aerobic floor systems.  

Floor must have two (2) coats of seal and two (2) coats of finish. 

Contractor will be responsible for replacing cove base in both rooms as well.


The courts should be covered with a sleeper system and a hardwood surface.  Maple tongue and groove and pressure treated beech are the recommended requirements for playing court surface.

1.	Shock absorption-a floor’s ability to reduce the impact of contact with the floor surface.  The greater the shock absorption, the more protective it is because it reduces impact forces.  An aerobics floor, for example, would need more shock absorption than a basketball court. 
2.	Standard vertical deformation – the actual vertical deflection of the floor upon impact.  The greater the deformation, the more the floor deflects downward.  Floors with minimal deformation are not good at absorbing impact forces.
3.	Deflective indention- the actual vertical deflection of the floor at a distance 50 cm from the point of impact.  The greater the indentation, the more likely impact at one spot will cause deflection at a distant point.

<DESC>FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to procure a Wind Tunnel Under Floor Force Balance, with Calibration and Training, for the United States Naval Academy.  Request for Quotation (RFQ) N00140-04-Q-4205 contemplates a firm fixed price contract.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside.  It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions, which may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.arnet.gov/far and www.dtic.mil/dfars.  The NAICS code is 423490.   It is requested that qualified sources submit a quote for the following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs): CLIN 0001: 1 (each) Six Component Wind Tunnel Under Floor Force Balance; CLIN 0002: 1 (lot) Calibration and Training; CLIN 0003: 1 (each) - Shipping.

The Specifications are as follows: The proposed balance shall be of an external configuration design, with six-component measurement capabilities: 3 orthogonal forces (normal, axial, and side forces) and 3 orthogonal moments (rolling, pitching, and yawing moments). The balance/system provided by the supplier must meet or exceed all conditions and specifications stated in the Request for Quotation, meet or exceed all conditions and specifications stated in the suppliers documentation and perform all functions stated in the supplier's documentation in a satisfactory manner.  The proposed balance shall resolve six load components.  The ranges for the static design loads of the proposed balance are defined as follows: Normal Force (lift) -  Load Magnitude Range: 600 +/- 50 lbs, Load Offset: -600/+0 lbs; Axial Force (drag)- Load Magnitude Range: 200 +/- 20 lbs, Load Offset: -200/+0 lbs, Side Force: 600 +/- 50 lbs, Load Offset:  +/- 600 lbs; Rolling Moment- Magnitude Range: 250 +/- 20 ft-lbs, Load Offset:+/- 250 ft-lbs; Pitching Moment- Magnitude Range: 180 +/- 20 ft-lbs, Load Offset: +/- 180 ft-lbs; Yawing Moment - 130 +/- 20 ft-lbs, Load Offset: +/- 130 ft-lbs. These ranges are based on prior wind tunnel tests and planned future capabilities.  The proposed balance shall have the capability to easily offset the applied loads with no degradation in performance. These offset loads are to be included within the positive and negative design load ranges as designated above. The external balance and all associated equipment shall possess a minimum factor of safety in design loading of 2.5.  All calibrated forces and moments shall be resolved about the Moment Reference Center (MRC).  The MRC of the external balance shall maintain a spherical tolerance of 1/32 inch diameter or less during all wind tunnel operations (wind on). This tolerance includes (but is not limited to) model loading and motion as defined herein. The MRC of the proposed external balance shall be aligned vertically along the turntable axis of rotation of the Wind Tunnel Test Section (21 inches above the turntable). This position shall be within a tolerance which prevents fouling between the balance metric and non-metric components.  The MRC of the proposed external balance shall coincide axially with the test section midplane (52 inches – 57 inches downstream of the test section inlet plane) within +/- 1/32 inch.  Balance system accuracy (defined as the accuracy of the complete balance system - including but not limited to balance frames, load cells, signal conditioning equipment, data acquisition system, etc.) must meet standards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) located in the United States. The Quoter, as part of his quote submission, shall indicate balance system accuracy. It is desired that the balance system be accurate to within +/- 0.01% of full-scale load or moment including hysteresis, non-linearity, and repeatability. The accuracy required is at the final point of the measurement chain (i.e., computer screen) and, hence, includes all balance system components (e.g., load cells, connections, signal conditioning, computer interface, etc.).  Balance system resolution is to be defined as the minimum measurable load or moment that the external balance system (including but not limited to balance frames, load cells, signal conditioning equipment, data acquisition system, etc.) shall indicate. The minimum system resolution for each component of the balance system is as follows: Normal Force (lift) - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.060 lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.010%; Axial Force (drag)- Maximum Component Resolution: 0.010 lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.005%; Side Force - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.060 lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.010%; Rolling Moment - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.025 ft-lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.010%; Pitching Moment - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.015 ft-lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.008%; Yawing Moment - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.010 ft-lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.008%.  Repeatability: The external balance system shall be able to repeat identical loading conditions to within the requirements listed in this document at long and short durations. The Quoter shall specify in his quote the intervals for checking repeatability of the balance system. The repeatability required is at the final point of the measurement chain and includes all balance system components (e.g., load cells, connections, signal conditioning, computer interface, etc.). Interactions - To simplify balance operations, checks, and calibrations, Quoter shall ensure that interactions between the balance components will be well defined and will behave as linearly as possible. The balance shall be a six component design with a maximum interaction into any one component by all other components for any given loading not to exceed two (2.0) percent of the full scale range.  Load Cells - Load transducers shall resolve to at least 1 part in 8000 with a total repeatability and hysteresis of 0.005 percent of full scale or better.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) for Commercial Items Acquisition in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and 13. Solicitation No. N68711-04-R-3613, REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL SERVICES AT VARIOUS NAVAL FACILITIES LOCATED IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and will be a single award Firm-Fixed Price and Indefinite Quantity contract. The performance period will include a base year and four 12-month option periods. This solicitation is UNRESTRICTED. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 562111 and the size standard is $10.5 million dollars. The solicitation documents, incorporated provisions, and clauses are those in effect through FAR Circular 01-24. This solicitation incorporates FAR 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212.3, 52.212.4, and 52.212-5, and are attached to the solicitation. PURSUANT TO SECTION 6001 OF THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 1976 (RCRA), 42 USC 6961, AND SECTION 66.0108, ARTICLE 6, OF THE SAN DIEGO MUNICIPAL CODE, OFFERORS MUST POSSESS (AT TIME OF AWARD) A VALID, UNREVOKED, AND UNEXPIRED CITY-GRANTED, NON-EXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE SOLICITED CONTRACT. PROOF OF SAID FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED PRIOR TO AWARD OF THE SUBJECT CONTRACT. The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: Factor #1 Key Personnel, Vehicles & Equipment, and Reporting. Key Personnel: Provide a resume of Project Manager and Quality Control Manager to be assigned to the contract. Vehicles & Equipment: Describe in sufficient detail, vehicles and equipment to meet the work requirements identified in the performance work statement (e.g., leased or owned, how many, age, and status). Explain how offeror will maintain equipment and containers in a clean, sanitary condition, and minimize odors. Reporting: Provide the process the offeror will use to ensure refuse and recyclable materials will be segregated, weighed and documented in accordance with the performance work statement. Factor #2 Past Performance Provide a list of up to 10 contracts similar in size and complexity to the solicited contract that were completed during the past 3 years and a list of all such similar contracts currently in process. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers. Provide the information on Exhibit A for each contract. Evaluation of past performance will often be subjective. The evaluation of past performance will include the contractor’s history of reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to customer satisfaction, record of conforming to applicable law and industry standards (i.e., Service Contract Act Wage Determinations); quality of workmanship, record of recommending and/or implementing innovative approaches and/or technologies; record of controlling costs; safety performance record, and adherence to schedules. The Government reserves the right to contact any other sources of information that may have knowledge or information on an offeror’s relevant past performance history. Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any offeror’s proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may not be competitive when compared to proposals of other offerors. Factor #3 Price The price proposal for the base and all option periods will be evaluated to determine the reasonableness, realism, and completeness of the offeror’s proposal. One or more of the following techniques will be used to ensure a fair and reasonable price: 1. Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. 2. Comparison of proposed prices with the independent Government estimate. 3. Comparison of proposed prices with available historical information. 4. Comparison of proposed prices with resources proposed. A price that is found to be either unreasonably high or unrealistically low in relation to the proposed work may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in the overall proposal being considered unacceptable. Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors: Key Personnel, Vehicles & Equipment, and Reporting and Past Performance are equally important to each other and when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. THIS RFP WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD FREE OF CHARGE VIA THE INTERNET WORLD WIDE WEB AT http://esol.navfac.navy.mil ON OR AROUND SEPTEMBER 22, 2004 AND CAN BE FOUND UNDER SOLICITATION/CONTRACT NO. N68711-04-R-3613. No hard copies (paper sets) or CD-ROM of the RFP will be provided by the Government. Telephone and facsimile request will not be accepted.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for other than commercial items. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) set forth in FAR Part 13.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) to develop and manufacture human or human compatible monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for evaluation in preclinical and clinical studies as therapies for botulism.  Monoclonal Abs proposed by the offeror for development under this RFP should have demonstrated potency in a standardized mouse protection bioassay for botulinum neurotoxins serotypes A1 and A2. 
The Project BioShield Act of 2004, enacted on July 21, 2004, authorizes the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), through the program carried out by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to simplify and expedite the award of contracts to perform or support research and development of countermeasures determined by the Secretary to be a priority to treat, identify, or prevent harm from any biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent that may cause a public health emergency affecting national security, or adverse health consequences that may arise from using such a countermeasure.  Consistent with this new authority, NIAID is announcing this simplified acquisition.
The growing terrorist threat of radiological or nuclear attack includes a range of possibilities beyond those historically envisioned.  In addition to detonation of a nuclear bomb, the civilian population may be at risk from radiological dispersion devices such as dirty bombs that utilize discarded nuclear materials, as well as attacks upon nuclear reactor facilities.  No medical countermeasures and detection program currently exist within a federal civilian research institution to address these needs.  The urgent, general need for medical countermeasures and detection methods against radiation injury, and the particular need for methods to reliably prevent immune functions after exposure, underlie the creation of this targeted initiative.

The Project BioShield Act of 2004, enacted on July 21, 2004, authorizes the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), through the program carried out by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to simplify and expedite the award of contracts to perform or support research and development of countermeasures determined by the Secretary to be a priority to treat, identify, or prevent harm from any biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent that may cause a public health emergency affecting national security, or adverse health consequences that may arise from using such a countermeasure.  Consistent with this new authority, NIAID is announcing this simplified acquisition.
The growing terrorist threat of radiological or nuclear attack includes a range of possibilities beyond those historically envisioned.  In addition to detonation of a nuclear bomb, the civilian population may be at risk from radiological dispersion devices such as dirty bombs that utilize discarded nuclear materials, as well as attacks upon nuclear reactor facilities.  No medical countermeasures and detection program currently exist within a federal civilian research institution to address these needs.  The urgent, general need for medical countermeasures and detection methods against radiation injury, and the particular need for methods to reliably prevent immune functions after exposure, underlie the creation of this targeted initiative.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is FA8902-04-R-1006 and is issued as a Request for Proposal.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 334513 and the business size is 500 employees. The Government intends to issue a contract for the Systems Program Office 311 Human Systems Wing, Brooks City-Base, TX. The contractor shall provide for a rewrite of an existing Technical Order 33D2-39-26-1 ACES II Ejection System.  The following information is provided.  
Existing Technical Order (TO) 33D2-39-26-1 has been outdated for many years.  A rewrite of the TO is necessary in order to consolidate numerous changes and clarify the test procedures for the field units.  
Reference Government Documents: TO 33D2-39-26-1, Technical Manual, Operation and Maintenance Instructions with Illustrated Parts Breakdown, Environmental Sensor Test Set, TTU-415/E, Part Number 811-00148, Environmental Sensor Test Set Adapter, Part Number 811-00193, and Altitude Chamber, Part Number 811-00215.    
The contractor shall rewrite referenced TO to reflect Operation and Maintenance instructions with Illustrated Parts List for the Environmental Sensor Test Set, Model TTU-415/E, FXC P/N 811-00148.  TO should be written in a form that is easily understood by the user, and eliminates the potential for errors.  Failure to test the environmental sensor properly could result in installation of a faulty sensor.  Manual will be prepared in Word and PDF format. 

This is a follow-on requirement.  Without receiving acceptable capability information that addresses the specific technical and operational background that is required for this equipment it is the Air Force's intent to solicit only FXC Corporation as they are the sole manufacturer for the TTU-415 Tester.

Delivery will be made to the 311 HSW/YAPA, Brooks City-Base, TX. Provisions to include FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -Commercial Items (Jan 2004); FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (Oct 2003); FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (Apr 2004), apply to this acquisition. The closing date for this solicitation is 24 September 2004, 4:00 p.m. CDT. Ms. Dorothy Howe is the sole individual to contact for information regarding this solicitation. Her phone number is (210) 536-3853. Contracting Officer is Richard M. Williams (210) 240-4728. Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) is Olga Perez, (210) 536-3971.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number FE309942450018 is hereby issued as a Request for Quotation. Submit written offers only, oral offers will not be accepted. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  This combined synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24 and Defense Acquisition Circular 91-13 (Correction).  It is the contractor’s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions. Clauses and provisions can be found at: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffar1.htm.  This acquisition is 100% Small Business Set-Aside. North American Industrial Classification Standard: 333415 with a small Business Size Standard of 750 employees. CLIN (0001) Air Conditioner, Portable, (1 Each); 
-	25 Ton Capacity; 9600 CFM -Air Cooled DX unit; no heat 
-	Diesel-Generated Power and Fuel Tank w/hail guard - On Flat Bed Trailer with pintle hitch
-	Duct Openings: 2 x 20-inch Supply, 2 x 20-inch Return 
-	Dual electrical capabilities: primarily hooked up to generator power, but have the ability to run 75-100' of cable to a facility (including cable).
-	Flex duct should fit inside a weather proof box, and duct material should be weather resistance (an insulated if possible)
-	Each section of duct should be in 25-foot sections (interlocking collars)-up to 100 foot (on supply and return) and should hook directly to the AC unit.
-	Sized to have multi-stages (2-4 compressors).
-	Controlled with a thermostat and a return air controller. The preferred type of thermostat is one that can receive/send signals back to the package unit remotely (some type of infrared/antenna/radio freq-provide options).
-	Provide start-up and training.

- As a result from questions from already submitted here are a few Q/A's.

Question:

1. Please advise the capacity of the Generator you need for this portable a/c unit?
 
2. Do you intend to use the generator to power any other devise or need 120 volt outlets? 
 
3. I understand total Duct you will want is 200 feet (100 ea for supply & return) If they are insulated it will be hard to store them as it will not be as flexible. 

Answers:  

1.   The capacity of the generator should be at least 50KW.  
 
2.   The generator and the AC unit will primarily be dedicated to each other.  However in the case of an emergency, we would like the flexibility to connecting the AC unit to a building power source and to connect just the generator to other power requirements.  
  
3.   Insulated ducting is preferred if we can easily store it, but it is not necessary - uninsulated flex ducting will work.  The quantity required per duct is 100 ft (one supply and one return = 200 total ft, two supplies and two returns = 400 total ft, etc).  The ductwork should be in 25 ft sections with interlocking collars.  Weatherproof storage on the trailer for the ductwork needs to be included.
