<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services IAW with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. 27291904. The solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990. The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to The Food and Drug Law Institute, 1000 Vermont Avenue, NW, Suite 2001, Washington, DC 20005 for a Food, Drug and Law Institute (FDLI) sponsored workshop on Methods for Routine Documentation of Medical Device Use. 

Background: CDRH’s mission to fully monitor the safety of medical devices would be more feasible once device model information is collected and its use is routinely documented. Good documentation of both device use and problems are necessary for scientifically investigating the safety of devices. For patient safety reporting of adverse device events, it is essential that a device be uniquely identified. For improving patient safety, reports of adverse device events may be lead to analysis of the use of all or a sample of a particular device to obtain information about the likelihood of such events and may lead to patient follow-up by providers of their patients using such devices. In these cases, having unique device identification in the patients’ medical records, and pointers to a database for information about that specific device is necessary. One way to examine and facilitate potential solutions to the issue of unique identification is to bring experts from the relevant fields together to discuss the problem and recommend actions.  

The purpose of this project is to work with representatives from medical device industry representatives, major bar-coding systems, FCC representatives, the radio frequency identification industry, National Library of Medicine, other Federal agencies and academia. We want to obtain their feedback regarding the development of a public-private partnership with the idea of adopting a unique identification system for medical devices.  The end goal might then be the collection of this information via the FDA web based electronic system agency wide registration and listing system (FURLS) and the drafting of the regulations that would be required in order to collect this information.  The best vehicle for this work is through targeted workshops with these organizations.

The contractor will need to perform the Scope of Work, which is to include:
Requesting professional services to host and facilitate two workshops to obtain feedback on the development of a unique identification system for medical devices. These workshops would be held with CDRH and invited members of industry, government and academia to discuss this issue.  These workshops will be held at the FDLI office located in Washington, D.C. 1) Participants of the workshop will be given preliminary documentation to review prior to the meeting.  The information will describe where we are at with a unique identification system; 2) Attendees will participate in an information exchange with CDRH so that we can gain a better understanding of the impact and process of the proposed development of a public-private partnership with the goal of adopting a unique identification system for medical devices; 3) Two workshops will be held on the development of a public-private partnership with the goal of adopting a unique identification system for medical devices. The length of each workshop will be one and one-half days with dates to be determined.

Tasks for each workshop: a) Determine the list of non-FDA attendees based on their knowledge and experience with the medical device industry and academia.  CDRH will provide a list of criteria for which they will use to nominate these outside individuals and organizations; b) Prepare and mail invitations or email invitations along with any written materials provided by FDA; c) Facilitate each meeting/workshop held at FDLI’s Office/location; d) Record the information exchange at each workshop. This will include documenting of decisions and findings. These reports will be provided to CDRH within two weeks after a meeting is held. Contractor shall provide an electronic version (pdf) and hard copy of these minutes to each attendee. Contractor shall provide CDRH with an additional copy in Microsoft word format.

The contractor shall have a good grasp on how medical devices are manufactured and used. They must have an excellent understanding of the type of participants that need to be involved and have already established working relationships with many of the groups that the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) will need to use for this workshop.

Payment Schedule: Payment shall be made upon completion of all tasks and deliverables associated with a single workshop upon submission of an invoice. All payments are subject to the approval of the Project Officer. 

The FDA intends to make an award immediately following this notice. The anticipated period of performance will be approximately September 27, 2004 through September 30, 2005.

The following FAR clauses shall apply to the solicitation: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications; 52.214-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers. All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above. All questions should be submitted in writing via email to sharon.savage@fda.hhs.gov or fax to (301) 827-7106. FAR provisions can be found at the following website: http://www.arnet.gov.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement to continue planning and execution support for Program/Project Management and Systems Engineering in support of the Marshall Space Flight Center.	The requirement is for completion of Exploration Systems Mission (ESMD) management planning documentation, including an ESMD Program Manager's Handbook, and ESMD Simulation Based Acquisition Requirements Document, Modeling and Simulation Support Plan, Concept of Operations, System Engineering Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, and Verification, Validation, and Accreditation Policy and Implementation Plan. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase these services from QTEC, Inc. as a sole source requirement.  QTEC, Inc. currently supports this effort and the information and knowledge held by QTEC, Inc. precludes conducting a full competition at this time for the short duration effort required and the critical milestones for the program in the immediate future. Competition is impractical because the support to the above identified activities is already in progress using QTEC and MSFC personnel and these activities rely heavily upon the processes and technical expertise obtained during the current effort and the information gained from this process cannot be duplicated or communicated to another vendor in a timely manner to avoid impact to required delivery schedules. This potential award is for a bridge, not to exceed a six (6) month period of performance, from the effort currently under way until a competition can be conducted for the final stages of the support required for the ESMD. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Kimberly J. Adams, PS41, via email to kimberly.j.adams@nasa.gov not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on 13 December 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities.
A critical area of focus for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the development of Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) Monitors that improve our capability to address the threat of a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD), an Improvised Nuclear Device (IND), or a nuclear weapon being used by terrorists within the US.  DHS is implementing a comprehensive systems approach that emphasizes early detection and effective intervention capabilities at the Federal, state, and local levels, as well as post-event capabilities for remediation.  Under this Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) Monitor Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), HSARPA solicits portal detection systems that will contribute to an overall system of countermeasures.  
BAA05-04 is meant to augment the radiological portal monitor projects initiated under BAA04-02 Technical Topic Area 3 (TTA-3), released January 31 2004, with a revised deliverable schedule and refined performance requirements.  BAA05-04 and BAA04-02 TTA-3 fit into an acquisition plan that includes independent developmental and operational tests.  

It is the intent of DHS to issue an RFP in the 3rd quarter of FY2005 for the large scale procurement of Spectroscopic Portals.  The source selection for that RFP will, in part, be based upon the technical and operational evaluation of products developed through awards made under BAA04-02 and this BAA.  To be eligible to bid to the upcoming Advanced Spectroscopic Portal RFP, bidders must be selected under this BAA or under the first round of BAA04-02.

<DESC>This posting supersedes the notice No. HST-DM-0001-GDJ entitled "HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE (HST) DEORBIT MODULE", which was posted on April 30, 3004. NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE (HST) ROBOTIC SERVICING/DEORBIT MODULE.  The HST Robotic Servicing/Deorbit Module is only one part of an overall concept that could be used to extend the useful life of the observatory through various system hardware augmentations and then ultimately safely deorbit HST at the end of its mission.   This concept is currently under review within NASA with decisions planned by the end of May.  As relevant material is available it will made available at (http://hubble.gsfc.nasa.gov/end-of-mission.html  ). This procurement is intended to be full and open and all responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  The anticipated release date of the Final RFP is on or about 1 June 2004 with an anticipated offer due date of 21 July 2004. However, the past performance  volume of the proposal will be due on or about 1 July 2004.  Offerors are advised that a Complete Draft RFP will not be released with this solicitation. However, NASA/GSFC intends to release draft technical requirements for the RFP via the WWW as they become available (approximately mid-May 2004). In addition, we intend to conduct a pre-proposal conference at NASA/GSFC on or about 10 June 2004. The time and additional information of the pre-proposal conference will be provided at a later date. Attendance at the pre-proposal conference is recommended; however, attendance is not a prerequisite for proposal submission.  No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the  NASA Acquisition Internet Service. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is  http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=51  .

<DESC>The Procurement Office of the Agricultural Research Service, South Atlantic Area, announces a proposed construction solicitation scheduled to be released in early 2005.  The exact date has not yet been determined.  Another pre-solicitation announcement will be made in FedBizOpps at least fifteen days before the solicitation is released.  More specific information will be available in that notice.  The following project is expected to be advertised.  The project is entitled “New Headhouse/Greenhouse, Gainesville, FL.”  The work will include the construction of a new 2-bay greenhouse and a new headhouse.  The estimated price is expected to be between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  This is a preliminary notice only.  If you request the solicitation package because of this notice, expect a delay before these documents are issued.  Please do not make repeated requests simply because you do not receive the requested documents immediately.  The date the synopsis (the notice issued 15 days before the solicitation is issued) is published in the FedBizOpps will be a good indicator of when you should expect a response to your request.  Notification will be included in the synopsis if the solicitation will be available electronically through FedBizOpps.  If it is, no hard copy solicitations will be issued.  Be sure to be watching for the synopsis.  If the solicitation is not issued electronically and you would like to receive the solicitation package, please send your request in writing or via fax [(706) 546-3444] to Pat Jones, Procurement Technician.  Since your tax dollars are paying the expenses of copying and mailing the solicitation, we recommend you carefully review the synopsis before making the determination that you will indeed be interested in receiving the solicitation.  When you submit your request, please indicate (for statistical purposes) if you are a women-owned business; a small disadvantaged business; a HUBZone business; a veteran-owned business; a service-disabled veteran-owned small business; a small business; or other than a small business.

This is a market survey to locate a source for production, testing and delivery of MELIOS spares; the Electronic, Optics and Laser Modules. NSNs 5860-01-324-2790, 5860-01-324-2791 and 5860-01-324-8206 respectively. CECOM is looking for an (3 Year's) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract to be awarde d at the Mid of FY 2005. MELIOS:-(Description for information only); The Mini Eyesafe Laser Infrared Observation Set is a lightweight, individually operated,  hand-held or tripod-mounted laser rangefinder capable of determining ranges from 50 through 9995 meters in 5 meters increments and displaying the range in the eyepiece. Optics Module:-The Optics Module shall determine and display in the eyepiece the distance to a target with required minimum of 50 meters and maximum of 9995 meters,in 5 meters increments, by using the laser start pulse and the reflected laser stop pulse. T he optics Module shall exhibit no more than 1 failure out of any  100 consecutive rangings thereby determining the range to targets under the conditions that the emitter beam shall be parallel to the Optics Module Assembly optical axis,the emitter shall output 2 pulses, one for the start time, one for the stop time, and the emitter energy output shall correspond to the energy reflected  from a target 9990 meters distant. Laser Module:-The Laser Module consists of several components/assembly that receives high voltage from the Power Supply  Module (in the Electronic Module) and charges the storage capacitor, when the Charge Switch is pressed. The Pulse Forming Network(PFN) uses a capacitor to store energy during the Charge cycle. When the capacitor is fully charged, the ready  indicator illuminates. The laser, consisting of the flash lamp, laser rod,Q-switch assembly and partial mirror assembly, produces an output beam. This beam travels through the Output Collimating Telescope, which is made up of a corner cube prism,  telescope objective lenses, and the(visible light filter) output window. Electronics Module:- The Electronics Module consists of several        modules/switches. The Power Supply Module,depending on the position of the Mode Switch, supplies; 5Vdc to the specified circuits in the Optics and Laser Modules. 12 Vdc to the Receiver Module circuits in the Optics Module. Switched 24 Vdc.High Voltage for the laser Module (700 to 850 Vdc.) The Mode Switch connects battery power to the Power Supply Module circuits.The Mode Switch has 4 positions: OFF, FIRST RTN, LAS T RTN, TEST (PULL).With the Mode Switch in FIRST RTN or LAST RTN, the charge switch will initiate the charging of the PFN(Pulse Forming Network) capacitor in the Laser Module and, when the capacitor reaches the set voltage level,the ready indicator will illuminate in the display to the left of the  range digits. Performance Specifications for all these 3 spares(Modules); MIL-O-49251, MIL-L-49250, and MIL-E-49252 respectively are available upon request. This is not a request for proposals. Interested suppliers must include vendor brochures which detail comprehensive/complete information on technical and critical performence characteristics. Sample items/hardware are desired but not required and will not b e returned. Closing date for responses is 30 days after the publication of  this announcement.

The System shall include all hardware and software to provide a full array features and functionality.  The Engine Combustion Cycle Characterization and Analysis System  shall compute, log and display up to 100 combustion parameters in real-time for each cylinder, for contiguous combustion cycles.  "Real time" shall be taken to mean that all calculations for the current engine cycle are complete before the data acquisition for the next cycle is completed.  Post processing shall not be required to get combustion results, however a complete array of post processing functions shall be available to calculate and analyze parameters not selected at time of test.  The System shall record and store at least 64 megasamples ( 128 Mbytes) of raw and/or calculated combustion parameters for post test analysis.  The Engine Combustion Cycle Characterization and Analysis System shall have the ability to quantify knock on a cylinder-by-cylinder and cycle-by-cycle basis. Cylinder pressure signals shall be filtered to isolate the knock frequencies.  Intensity and peak value analysis shall be performed for each engine cycle. Simultaneous acquisition of standard combustion data shall allow for cycle-by-cycle correlation.  The System shall include a full set of display and analysis tools available through a clear, logical Graphical User Interface. The System shall be  designed, manufactured, and implemented to work to with a wide array of internal combustion engines, including spark ignition and compression ignition, utilizing a variety of fuel types and fuel injection schemes including multiple injection events for a single combustion cycle, 2 or 4-cycle engines, HCCI, variable displacement, unequal firing intervals and engines with up to 12 cylinders. The following options are also included in the procurement: (1) An option for up to two additional units; (2) An option for up to three "expansion kits" which will allow measurement of an extended number of cylinders;  (3) An option for a variety of spare components; (4) An option for additional modules of user training; (5) An option for an Extended Service Contract, renewable every year for a period of 4 years from the date of acceptance.

<DESC>The solicitation for the requisition of FLU-2A/P Inflation Assembly NSN 4220-00-920-3651 is hereby extended until 12/17/2004.  The reason for the extension is due to a specification change as reads below:

1.  The specification for this procurement shall be MIL-I-87108A dated 15 April 1983.  Performance specification Mil-PRF-87108 dated 16 June 1998 is not adequate for procurement of the FLU-2A/P inflation assembly.
 
2.  In Figure 1 of MIL-I-87108A a notch is shown at the top of the movable spring and sleeve assembly. We are removing the notch from this figure. In figure 9 the sleeve assembly is also shown with a notch.  We are removing the notch from this figure also. A note shall be added in the procurement notes  that states the sleeve assembly will be made in accordance with Figure 2 without a notch. 
 
3.  Add the requirement in paragraph 4.5.1 of Mil-I-87108A  under individual inspection to require that  every valve be inspected to the operating requirement of paragraph 3.6.6.
 
4.  We require that production lot testing be done per Mil-I-87108A.  This should be done on the FLU-2A/P inflation valve, NSN 4220-00-797-0847.

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Amend sentence 5 to add: "system for over ten years in producing assigned OPLANS, to include OPLAN 8044: Theater Planning and Global Strike Support Documents; new UCP tasking and related products."  APPROXIMATE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE:  4 June 2004.  The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a full and open competition, non-personal services, Cost Plus Award Fee, follow-on contract for a base period and 6 one-year option periods.  This effort is to provide engineering services for maintenance and enhancement of Automated Window Planning Systems (AWPS) and AWPS Analysis Initiative (AAI) software.  The Government anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for performance over a seven-year period.  This period will be the base year FY 05 contract and will include one-year options for the following six fiscal years (FY06 through FY11).  The AWPS tool has been a vital part of the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) system for over ten years.  AWPS/AAI is a PC based, windows driven graphical user interface with data management and analysis capabilities used to support nuclear weapons employment plan development.  AWPS/AAI provides plan review and analysis capabilities, mapping, damage calculation, data migration, and plan maintenance.  AWPS/AAI provides tools for production management, operations and quality review, damage calculations, and plan analysis.  Upcoming enhancements and development projects are potentially as follows: continuation of software improvement and maintenance efforts using SQL, PowerBuilder, Fortran; possible conversion all FORTRAN applications to C++.  The ISPAN program is undergoing modernization, based on the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) and Unified Command Plan (UCP) directions.  AWPS/AAI may require some new development and tools integration efforts.  Currently, the data base management system is Sybase, but efforts are underway to migrate to the Oracle platform.  All software will be maintained and developed in accordance with applicable DOD and AF regulations and standards, and USSTRATCOM Strategic Administrative Instructions and Architectures.  The contractor must maintain a SECRET facility clearance with storage capacity for SECRET documents and equipment.  All contractor personnel shall be a United States citizen and possess a TOP SECRET clearance.  Any contractor personnel required to work on the  ISPAN computer system must have a TOP SECRET clearance with SBI and be SIOP/ESI briefed.  This acquisition will not be conducted using commercial procedures per FAR Part 12.  The RFP and all associated documents, when issued, will be posted on the required government wide point of entry.  No solicitation is available at this time.  Offerors are encouraged to subscribe/register for this solicitation number through http://www.fedbizopps.gov to ensure they automatically receive all documents associated with the procurement in a timely manner.  All associated documents will be released electronically.  The NAICS code is 541511, and the size standard is $21M.  Anticipated award date is 17 Nov 2004.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is using this special notice synopsis to encourage exchange of information with industry concerning the Unit Operations Center (UOC) Total Life Cycle Systems Management (TLCSM).  The Program Manager (PM) UOC is responsible for providing the requisite support capability to maintain the system’s readiness, sustainment and operational capability.  Emphasis is placed on increasing reliability and reducing logistics footprint in the systems engineering process, and providing effective sustainment support using Performance Based Logistics (PBL) strategies.  The overall intention of the PBL initiative is to acquire support as an integrated, affordable, performance package designed to optimize system readiness and meet performance goals through long-term support arrangements.  The Statement of Objectives (SOO) is included in the attachment.

There is no funded requirement at this time.  However, it is the Government's intent to encourage exchange of information to improve the Government's understanding of industry capabilities and existing and potential technologies in order to determine a realistic solution.

<CONTACT>Emily Tuck, Procurement Specialist, Phone (202) 225-0668, Fax (202) 226-2214, Email emily.tuck@mail.house.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.
	THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.


The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available products.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The United States House of Representatives (USHR) is soliciting industry for commercially available products that can provide an integrated technological solution for accounting for building occupants immediately following building evacuations and, during the immediate 24-hour period thereafter, the status of all House building occupants (Members, staff, contractors/vendors and visitors). 

USHR is seeking contemporary information and current state-of-the-art mechanisms that provide a reliable, robust, and rapid accumulation of real-time operationally accessible data concerning the status of evacuated personnel:

1.	who have gathered in assembly areas;
2.	who are dislocated from the Capitol campus during evacuation events but need to report their status;
3.	who have traveled or are in transit to a secondary location, or are out of the local area and need to report their status.

Additionally, proposed solutions should provide a real-time, 3-D graphical, GIS display of building evacuation/occupancy for Incident Commanders and Emergency Operations Center staff.

Due to the sensitive nature of data being collected, data security is absolutely essential for any product to be considered acceptable.

For the purpose of this request, the USHR desires that a two-phased approach to the accountability process be examined:

The overall purpose of this approach is to provide timely information to law enforcement and USHR officials as to building evacuation status and relative safe-status of employees, for use in tactical and strategic decision making by these officials during emergency conditions.   Such data (Phase 1) may also be used by first responder personnel to assist in determining the percentage of employees “accounted for,” building-by-building, and assist these responders in the use of on-scene emergency resources.

Phase 1:  (Short term accountability / building empty status) Systems and mechanisms that assist in identifying and accounting for staff who have evacuated the building.  This phase, and the systems and mechanisms being sought, should achieve comprehensive accountability/status reports within sixty (60) minutes of the evacuation event.  This should include input to a 3-D or graphical display of the affected building by room and floor, showing the status of evacuation and/or check-in of personnel based on where they reside in the building.

Phase 2:  (Long term / 100 % accountability) Systems and mechanisms that assist in recalculating and augmenting the ‘Phase 1” system, which, within a 24-hour period of time, accepts input from varying sources (telephone calls; email or web-based responses, etc.) and refines initial reporting to provide a complete picture of the status of all USHR building occupants. 

USHR is located in downtown Washington, DC.  The facilities housing USHR consist of 4 main office buildings, the United States Capitol building, and other smaller buildings clustered in an urban area encompassing an area of 0.8 square miles.  Approximately 13,500 employees work for the USHR within these facilities.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 15 February 05 to Emily Tuck  Office of Procurement  359 Ford House Office Building  Washington, DC  20515  Emily.Tuck@mail.house.gov  .  There is no specific limitation on overall maximum volume/size of submittals.  With regard to all submittals, an executive summary of no more than 12 pages should be included.  Details of individual systems described should be no more than 4 pages.  Submittals should include examples of systems currently available to support the above specified operations, to include known locations where they are in use.  Multiple systems may be proposed to meet the various needs specified, if appropriate.  For currently available systems, proposals should include an estimate of lifecycle costs to include separate specification of purchase, implementation and maintenance costs.  New design efforts to meet the needs may be submitted; however, currently available systems are preferred.

A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USHR will not release any information – marked with a Proprietary legend – received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Legislative Branch of the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement only. This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the 55th Contracting Squadron to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10. This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing engineering services to provide maintenance and enhancement of Automated Window Planning Systems (AWPS) and AWPS Analysis Initiative (AAI) software.   The Government anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for performance over a five-year period.  This period will be the base year FY 05 contract and will include options for the following four fiscal years (FY06 through FY09).  The AWPS tool has been a vital part of the SWPS system for over ten years.  AWPS/AAI is a PC based, windows driven graphical user interface with data management and analysis capabilities used to support nuclear weapons employment plan development.  AWPS/AAI provides plan review and analysis capabilities, mapping, damage calculation, data migration, and plan maintenance. AWPS/AAI provides tools for production management, operations and quality review, damage calculations, and plan analysis.  Upcoming enhancements and development projects are potentially as follows: continuation of software improvement and maintenance efforts using SQL, PowerBuilder, Fortran; possible conversion all FORTRAN applications to C++.  The SWPS program is undergoing modernization, based on the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) and Unified Command Plan (UCP) directions.  AWPS/AAI may require some new development and tools integration efforts.  Currently our DBMS is Sybase, but efforts are underway to migrate to the Oracle platform.   All software will be maintained and developed in accordance with applicable DOD and AF regulations and standards, and USSTRATCOM Strategic Administrative Instructions and architectures. The contractor must maintain a SECRET facility clearance with storage capacity for SECRET documents and equipment. All contractor personnel shall be a United States citizen and possess a TOP SECRET clearance. Any contractor personnel required to work on the Strategic War Planning System (SWPS) computer system must have a TOP SECRET clearance with SBI and be SIOP/ESI briefed. The NAIC code is 541511. Request respondents capable of performing this effort furnish a capability package of no more than 10 pages no later than 30 days from the date of this posting.  Please include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact with e-mail address, business size, DUNS number, CCR registration number, Federal Cage code, general description of the company with proven ability to meet requirements, and description of similar contracts.  The description of contracts should include agency name, contract number, dollar magnitude, performance period, and points of contact with current phone number.  This RFI is not a commercial solicitation per FAR Part 12.  Address questions via e-mail to the contract specialist or contracting officer only.  No discussions will be conducted telephonically.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States, our allies and friends. The Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase.  MDA efforts will make the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and able to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  In addition, the BMDS must function without extensive detailed a-priori knowledge of our adversary’s systems.  Wherever adversaries launch, to whatever target they choose, we must be able to detect, track, identify and kill that ballistic missile.  In support of these efforts, MDA programs are geared towards advancing technological thresholds in both hardware and software.  This push is fundamental to the strategy of spiral development with Block improvements in the BMDS every two years.  We advance technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS capabilities in the far term.  Within MDA, the Advanced Systems Deputate (AS) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS. This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing innovative concepts for BMDS integration, and leading the effort to develop algorithms for improving BMDS capability.  The Missile Defense Science, Technology And Research (MSTAR) Program, administered by MDA/AS, is designed to identify and develop new and innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technical improvements to all elements of the BMDS.  MDA/AS has instituted the MSTAR Program in order to sponsor fundamental, MDA relevant research and development at accredited United States universities and academic institutions as well as to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.  The MSTAR Program is a competitive, science and technology university program, which will consist of forefront research and development technology, concepts, and approaches through scientific and technological investigation in the following ten MSTAR topic areas: (1) Sensing, Ranging, Imaging, and Phenomenology, Example MDA Technologies or Interest:  Simultaneous Multicolor Focal Plane Arrays; Plasma Antennas, Lightweight Optics, Multi-Sensor Correlation and Integration; (2)Detection, Tracking, Discrimination, Decision Theory, Asset (Sensor and Weapon) Resource Management and Kill Assessment; Example MDA Technologies or Interest:  Wide-angle Acquisition Sensor for Laser Communications, Precision Relative Position Sensors, Integrated Star-Tracker and Inertial Reference Unit, Bayesian Decision Networks, Optimization; (3)Propulsion Technologies, including novel divert propulsion; (4)  Electronic and Photonic Materials and Devices; Example MDA Technologies or Interest:  Technologies employing increased IR Cutoff Wavelength; (5)MEMS and Nanotechnologies, Robotics and Microsystems; (6) Directed Energy and Non-Linear Optical Devices and Processes; Example MDA Technologies or Interest:  Nanofiber Reinforcement Composite Optics; Lightweight, Movable, Precision, Off-Axis, Parabolic, Calibration Mirrors; (7) Guidance and Control, Platform Technologies, and Kill Enhancement; Example MDA Technologies or Interest:   Miniature Interceptor Technologies, Survivable Lightweight Materials for Operation in Caustic Environments, Low Cost High Performance Gyroscope; (8) Power Generation and Conditioning, Thermal Management; Example MDA Technologies or Interest:  High Voltage Power Amplifiers, Distributed Low-Power Density Apertures, Power Devices Self Protection; (9) Force Protection of Missile Defense Systems and Facilities; (10) Information Processing and Computing Technologies, Human in the Loop (MDA Operations) Intelligence Processing and Decision Making in Near Real Time.  If interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a combined technical and management proposal limited to ten pages, including a one-page executive summary of the technical and management proposal.  The technical and management proposal shall include full discussion of the scope, nature, and objectives of the proposed research effort; rationale for the technical contribution to MDA goals to include identification of the MSTAR topic area the proposal is submitted under; related research efforts performed in the past; a description of and statement of availability of facilities and instrumentation required for performance; a description of management planning and control systems; and identification of limited data rights or computer software, if any.  In addition the offeror must provide the following, exclusive of the ten page limitation: a Statement of Work (SOW) suitable for contract incorporation, and resumes of key personnel; (2) Cost proposal limited to five pages.  The cost proposal shall be submitted as a separate document together with supporting detailed cost data, including subcontractor data, if any.  Offers shall include a summary of the cost proposal at the cost element level (i.e., total direct labor, overhead, general and administrative, etc).  Summaries should also include a funding profile by fiscal year.  Offerors’ proposals shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .PDF file) and should be marked appropriately if they contain proprietary information.  All proposals shall remain valid for acceptance by the Government for a period of 180 days.  MDA will evaluate the responses based on the following criteria (weighted equally):  (1) Scientific and technical excellence of the research and its relevance to MDA goals (to include anticipated benefits to basic or applied/exploratory research effort to the MDA mission), with special emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness; (2) The offeror’s capabilities, related experience, adequacy of available or obtainable instrumentation and facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (3) Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel that are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; (4) Ability of the proposed effort to make progress toward demonstrating the feasibility of the concept in accordance with MDA programmatic needs; (5) Adequacy of management planning and controls; demonstrated ability to deliver results from research projects, on schedule, on or under cost; and (6) Cost will be evaluated as follows: the proposals will be evaluated against the government’s estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed; total evaluated probable cost consists of the government’s estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offerors’ proposals, to include the government’s assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, and other cost related factors.  This BAA will remain open until January 31, 2005.  Offerors may submit separate proposals on any or all the specified topic areas of research.  Proposals will not be evaluated until the close of this announcement.  Proposal evaluations will be completed not earlier than 60 days after the close of the announcement.  The Government may use selected support contractor and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.  Submission of white papers under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgement and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.  Award announcements are expected to be made on April 15, 2005.  MDA expects to award four to six contracts during the third or fourth quarter of Fiscal year 2005.  The period of performance for the resultant awards will range from twelve months to thirty-six months with a funding level of $150,000 to $200,000 per contract year.  The contract document, upon award, will include details of the contract deliverables.  MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this announcement.  Offerors are reminded that a BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35.016).  Concepts submitted related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals submitted, or to select only part of an effort described in a proposal for award.  MDA requires offering institutions submitting a proposal under the MSTAR Program to have the lead Principal Investigator(s) (PIs) hold United States (US) citizenship.  MDA desires participating students conducting research for or sponsored under an MSTAR Program award hold US citizenship.  The government reserves the right to request special justification in the circumstance for considering one or more legal non-US citizen students, who hold valid green cards, participation in research for or for sponsorship through an MSTAR Program award.

“Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) Initiative”

The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541690, with a size standard of $6.0M per annum.  Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  THIS IS NOT AN RFP AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NIH, NCI TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO RFP PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to:  1) provide administrative and technical support to operate the two national Central IRBs currently in place for review of selected NCI multi-center trials (an estimated 50-75 protocols per year, per board); 2) provide support to the local IRBs enrolled in the Initiative; 3) organize, recruit and manage the integration of an estimated 2,000 new sites into the Initiative; 4) interface with 9 national cooperative groups with 2 separate offices each, around the country; and 5) administer and support a third Board, if necessary, to handle growth.

Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following: 

•	Manage and provide administrative/regulatory support for two Central IRBs, one for adult trials and one for pediatric trials; 
•	Manage and support current and newly enrolled participating local sites;
•	Conduct the recruitment and integration of new sites into the Initiative;
•	Provide informatics support and system integration;
•	Support NCI’s internal and external communications efforts regarding all aspects of the Initiative;
•	Implement and manage an Initiative-wide Quality Improvement Plan;
•	Provide support for the formal accreditation of both CIRBs in contract year 2 or 3, as determined by NCI;
•	Develop and implement a system for utilizing central review for sites that do not have a local IRB; and
•	Establish and support a second Board for adult trials if it is needed to handle the growth in the menu of Phase 2 protocols.

As these tasks indicate, the Contractor’s responsibilities are more complex than simply the routine management of two central IRBs.  One unusual feature of this Initiative is that every decision the CIRBs make have an impact on a national trial development and distribution system; consequently, all Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) must be integrated with the relevant administrative procedures of the NCI, the Cooperative Group Operations offices and the Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU).  Also, due to the high profile of this Initiative, sophisticated data management, analysis and presentation reflecting all activities in the above tasks is required.

In addition to the above, all eligible small business concerns must document the ability of their staff to meet frequently/or on short notice (within the workday) face-to-face with CTEP Program Staff.

Basic information about the CIRB Initiative can be obtained from the following website at www.ncicirb.org .  There will be a technical question and answer session on December 14, 2004 in the NCI Research Contracts Branch Conference Room at 6120 Executive Boulevard, Bethesda, MD 20892, Room 6005 of Suite 6001, from 10:00AM until 12:00PM local time, to help you in preparation of your capability statement.  If you plan to attend the question and answer session, please send an e-mail or fax to the person listed under Point of Contact, along with all questions you may have, by December 9, 2004, 3:30PM EST.  Please note, all submitted questions will not be answered until the actual question and answer session on December 14, 2004.

Sources possessing experience and demonstrated capability to accomplish the aforementioned requirements are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform the required services.  Information furnished must not exceed 10 pages and should include an outline of previous or similar projects and other available literature for the NIH to perform a proper evaluation of your capability statement.  Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern’s name and address).

Responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION notice may be submitted electronically to John R. Manouelian, Contract Specialist, at manouelj@mail.nih.gov in either WordPerfect or Microsoft Word OR faxed to (301) 402-6699 by December 20, 2004, 3:30PM EST.

<DESC>The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS), a Primary Level Field Activity (PLFA) of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), is seeking sources who can sell government surplus property from 14 European locations.  The European locations would be in Germany, Italy, Spain, Iceland, Portugal (Azores Islands), and England.  Currently, the revenue from these locations (as a total) has been declining since 1999, but projected to gross at just under $3M per year for the next several years.  Some locations (Germany and Italy) generate the vast majority of revenue over other locations (Iceland and Portugal).  However, DRMS is seeking sales support from all locations.  DRMS costs associated with the sale of this property at these locations has been declining, but are projected to be around $1.5M per year.  The type of property available at these locations includes, but is not limited to aircraft parts/equipment, vehicular parts/equipment, hardware, machine tools, agricultural equipment, electrical/electronic equipment, medical/dental/veterinary equipment, household furnishings, ADP equipment, textiles, clothing, and other misc. equipment, parts, and supplies.     

If DRMS pursues hiring a contractor to sell this property, it is envisioned that the contractor will be able to  maximize the revenue stream via a competitive bid process using auctions or sealed bids, while minimizing the cost structure.  In order to maximize revenue the contractor would conduct market research, lot property, advertise and sell the government surplus property via a competitive sales method.  Other services the contractor may need to provide include, but are not limited to, administer the sale and load out customer conveyances, assist government with property accountability and coordinate with local government office (where property is to be sold) with the general logistics of selling and moving the property.  In addition, the contractor would have the option to sell the property from each location or physically move it to another site.  However, for planning purposes, moving the property to another site, may become a necessity due to the increasing requirements for keeping U.S. bases secure.  Finally, all property must be accounted for and attempted to be sold.  

DRMS is seeking information regarding a pricing structure for this contract.  DRMS may consider a percentage of the revenue generated from subsequent sales actions.  Or, DRMS may consider a revenue sharing and cost sharing arrangement.  DRMS is inquiring how industry would perceive how a pricing structure would work.  DRMS wants to pay a fair price where both parties would have a shared risk rather than all risk weighing on either the government or the contractor.

This is an information gathering request only.  DRMS reserves the right to determine the final outcome of the pricing structure and solicitation criteria.  Please respond by close of business January 14, 2005, either in writing or telephonically, to Mr. Don Zimmerman, 74 N. Washington Ave, Battle Creek, MI  49017, (269)961-7593, facsimile (269)961-5283, or don.zimmerman@dla.mil regarding this project.

<SUBJECT>46 -- Water Purification
<DESC>An Economical System for Removal of Arsenic from Drinking Water


Sandia National Laboratories has developed an economical and easily implemented process for removing arsenic from drinking water (U.S. patent 6,821,434).   The United States Environmental Protection Agency recently lowered the arsenic standard for drinking water from 50 parts per billion to 10 parts per billion, with the regulation to take effect in 2005.  The Sandia process is based on using off- the- shelf technology and an inexpensive, readily available chemical sorbent, which has already been approved and is being used in treatment processes for drinking water.   

The Sandia process is based on the use of magnesium oxide for sorbing arsenic from drinking water.  Magnesium oxide is an inexpensive mineral approved for use in drinking water treatment processes.   It is commonly used for water pH adjustment and water softening.  In small-scale water treatment processes at Sandia, one-half gram of magnesium oxide added to a liter of water reduced arsenic levels from 250 parts per billion to 4 parts per billion in only two minutes. Once the arsenic has been sorbed by the magnesium oxide, it can be removed by conventional processes such as filtration, air flotation, or centrifugal separation.  The used sorbent containing the sorbed arsenic meets all regulations and passes EPA leaching tests for sanitary landfill disposal. 

The Sandia process is very economical.  Magnesium oxide only costs a few cents per pound. A tank for mixing the magnesium oxide with the drinking water and a separator are all that is needed.  If desired, the water pH can be adjusted using chemical treatment or air sparging to make the water more palatable.  Air sparging is a common process used for adjusting drinking water pH in large city and small communities throughout the country.  

Sandia is seeking partnerships with industry for commercialization of this technology which may include commercial licensing opportunities.  Assuming commercial licensing opportunities are pursued; licensees would have the opportunity to request, up to and including, an exclusive license to Sandia’s IP in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation.

Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185-1380. cakearn@sandia.gov or Fax:  (505) 844-8011.

<SUBJECT>A -- ELECTROMECHANICAL PROPERTIES EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST),  Magnetic Technology Division proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Colorado to perform electromechanical measurements of the effect of strain on the critical current of  low-temperature superconductors.  The goal is to determine the stress sensitivity of the high-field niobium-tin superconductors for high-energy-physics-accelerator and fusion magnet programs.  The measurements are to be performed using specially designed NIST cryostats.  The staff at the University of Colorado has a combination of skills and past experience in cryogenic-system design, handling of cryogenic fluids, and operation of both high and low current sources.  The staff also has a thorough knowledge of conduction properties and flux-pinning force mechanisms of superconductors needed to complete the essential analysis and interpretation of data.   Specific work tasks will include measuring the effect of strain on the critical-current of brittle superconducting materials, as well as commissioning and testing the lambda-fridge in our high-field magnet system.  In the case of superconductors, analysis of the data will be performed in terms of the Strain Scaling Law and deviatoric strain models.  The contract period is January 1, 2005 through April 30, 2005.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Based on our market research, the University of Colorado's Physics Department is the only contractor who can meet the requirements of this procurement.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions can be found on http://www.arnet.gov/far/ and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/reflib/alp1296.htm.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing to the attention of Ms. Rima (e-mail preferred).  Anticipated award date is December 17, 2004.

<SUBJECT>D -- Document Scanning Services
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to solicit and negotiate a sole-source modification to incorporate the State of Alaska under Panacea Consulting, Incorporated’s current contract number SS00-04-60116 for nationwide document scanning services.  The delivery time for source documents to the contractor’s scanning facility will be 3 business days.  The estimated volumes are: 38,000 documents for fiscal year (FY) 2005 (from June through September 2005); 100,000 documents for FY 2006; 175,000 documents per year for FYs 2007 and 2008; and 150,000 documents for FY 2009.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302.  SSA has a reasonable basis to conclude that the Agency’s minimum needs for these services can only be met under the existing contract in order to maintain and protect the integrity (including project approach and management, cost and schedule) of SSA’s initiative to convert to electronic disability folders.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, as provided by FAR 5.203(a)(1), all responses received within fifteen (15) calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

<SUBJECT>B -- DFAS announces BCA results for Accounting Services, Moves forward to achieve High- Performing Organization
<DESC>The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)has announced the results of its recently completed Business Case Analysis for the Accounting Services Business Line.
Based on analysis of its Army, Navy, Air Force and Defense Agencies accounting functions, the BCA recommends pursuing a High-Performing Organization (HPO) for the departmental and field accounting services as well as accounting systems functions.
By transforming Accounting Services into an HPO, the analysis projects cost reductions associated with these functions could exceed $500 million over three years.
"Accounting Services is the largest business line within DFAS. By taking a good look at how we do business and how we can better anticipate and meet the needs of our customers in the future, we can have a significant impact on improving the effectiveness and costs of DFAS operations, products and services," said Lee Krushinski, DFAS Director of Accounting Services.
A cross-functional team of DFAS employees conducted the BCA according to the published six-step process established for all DFAS BCAs:
1. Identify team 
2. Define scope 
3. Define current organization 
4. Conduct market research 
5. Analyze options 
6. Provide recommendation
The team evaluated several options, ranging from the HPO to conducting an A-76 competition. They determined the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats associated with each available option before making their recommendation to move toward an HPO.
While this recommendation includes departmental accounting, field accounting and systems functions for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Defense Agencies; it excludes the following:
Security Assistance Accounting -- Recently completed A-76 resulted in creation of a Most Efficient Organization (MEO) 
U.S. Marine Corps Accounting -- Previously recommended for an A-76 competition 
Disbursing -- Previously recommended for transition to an HPO.

Planning will begin with formation of an HPO team that will develop and recommend concept of operations outlining the organization and functions of the HPO. The team's recommendations are expected in the spring of 2005 for consideration by DFAS leadership. When approved, implementation will occur over three years.
The results of this BCA are part of DFAS's overall transformation process to ensure DFAS provides the best value to its customer as it pursues its vision of becoming a world class finance and accounting organization.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  FERC05C50125 is issued as a request for proposal and all provisions/clauses are those in effect through FAC 01-25 correction. This solicitation is unrestricted under NAICS number 519190, All Other Information Services, and the size standard is $6,000,000.

Statement of Work:  1. INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requires a disaster recovery facility that supports the general support system (GSS) and e-Library systems Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP) and the FERC Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). The facility must be activated and operational following the declaration of a disaster that disables the primary facility. The facility must be capable of hosting the GSS infrastructure and providing retrieval of documents for the eLibrary system via the internet using current eLibrary web interfaces.

2.  BACKGROUND.  The GSS provides core computing resources and functionality to FERC’s staff at its Washington D.C. location at 888 1st St., NE.  For the purpose of this RFP this includes email, network storage, Active Directory domain structure, and database hosting.  The eLibrary system (formerly known as FERRIS) is a database system that manages, stores, and retrieves documents that have been received or issued by the FERC after November 16, 1981, plus a very limited number of older document files and dockets that have been retrofitted into the system. There are currently 2.5 million documents in the system and about 1.6 million files that are referenced in the documents.

3. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORT. 3.1 Technical Requirements.  FERC has identified one option for creating a disaster recovery site. Offerors are encouraged to suggest their own interpretation on the selected option and the associated recovery time.  A general description follows:  Hot Standby. The contractor maintains a secondary site that meets all requirements but data is not synchronized and no traffic is directed to the site. In the event of a disaster data backups must be restored before traffic can be re-directed to the site. Recovery time should be within twelve to twenty-four hours of declaring an emergency. 

3.1.1 Infrastructure and Environmental requirements. In order to guarantee availability and support the recovery at a secondary location due to a disaster, certain minimal requirements exist.  The facility must not be within a 20 mile radius of the primary site (888 1st St.) and all equipment and all systems listed must have N+1 redundancy.  The contractor’s facility must provide the following:

•	Completely redundant and dedicated; 100Mb/s or higher Public Internet access; 
•	100Mb Ethernet switched backbone;
•	The network must be protected by a properly configured, stateful inspection, hardened operating system firewall with intrusion detection.  The firewall must also have the ability to create a standard IPSEC 3DES VPN with other firewalls.  Preferably a Cisco PIX firewall would be used;
•	Adequate facility security including features such as 24 hour a day manned and video security monitoring of the facility and access to the facility is restricted to facility customers and is verified with a combination of ID check, biometrics and/or a “man trap”.  Access to the FERC equipment shall be further restricted to FERC authorized individuals;
•	The facility must provide redundant A/C power and on site diesel generators with sufficient fuel to last for 2 days with contracts for additional fuel delivery
•	Access to the facility must be possible 24 hours a day 365 days a year to designated, authorized FERC personnel.
•	The facility must be able to maintain a temperature between 62 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit
•	The facility must have a multi-zone fire suppression system
•	To control flooding the facility must be built above sea level, without having equipment located in a basement, and with proper drainage and a moisture detection system
•	Facility must not be located in seismic zones 4 or 3 and must be location specific seismic compliant.  Non-structural components and equipment must be anchored and braced in accordance with the requirements of the 1997 Uniform Building Code

3.1.2. Hardware/Technical requirements. In addition to the requirements below, the contractor must have the ability to restore data from the following media types; DLT, SDLT, DAT, DLT4 and 12” 30GB Optical WORM (for FileNet).

3.1.2.1 GSS. The GSS can be broken down into several distinct components including; Exchange 2000, Active Directory, Network Storage, and database hosting.  Each of these components has their own technical design and hardware requirements.

Exchange 2000 is used by FERC to provide email functionality for its staff.  The system currently consists of 1,063 mailboxes with a total private storage totaling 133GB.  In the event of a disaster these mailboxes must be accessible from a remote location via the Internet using POP3, MAPI, and HTTP.  Security can be assured by creating a site to site VPN from the remote location to the DR facility.  When the disaster occurs, the entire current mailbox content will be restored to the secondary facility’s Exchange system.  When the disaster has passed and the system is being transitioned back to the primary facility all current content from the secondary facility will be imported.  To provide minimal functionality the system must have the following specifications:  Intel Dual 2.7 GHz, 3GB Ram, and 200GB storage.

FERC’s Active Directory infrastructure is required to provide authentication services as well as support the Exchange 2000 system.  Overall the AD system has approximately 5,000 objects, 100 organization units and 11 domain controllers.  During a disaster a VPN must be in place with the proper ports open to the remote location to allow authentication and communication with the AD domain controllers.  At a minimum two domain controllers will be required with the following specifications:  Intel Single 2.7 GHz, 2GB Ram, and 40GB storage.

Network storage must be made available via Windows network shares and provide a total 3TB of space.  Client systems must be able to access their data during the disaster utilizing the site to site VPN.   For remote users, a SharePoint Portal server will be used to provide secure web access to files in the network storage system.  The SharePoint server needs to have the following specifications:  Single 2.4Ghz, 1GB Ram, and 40GB of storage.  Additionally some users and regional offices will utilize a VPN client to connect through the secondary facility firewall to allow access to files and applications.

FERC has many online programs that depend on the functionality of their database systems.  All database systems are currently hosted on the Windows 2000 platform and consist of thirteen SQL 7.0, and four SQL 2000 databases with a combined total of 145GB of data.  The secondary facility will need to have two servers, one for each type of database system.  The SQL 2000 server needs to have a Single 2.4Ghz, 1GB Ram, and 140GB of storage.  The SQL 7.0 server should have a Single 2.4Ghz, 2GB Ram, and 160GB storage.  

 3.1.2.2 eLibrary. There are three servers that are required for minimal operation of the eLibrary system, the web server, Verity server, and FileNet/Oracle server.  Each of these systems must meet or exceed the specifications of the current systems and the applications that are to be installed on them.  In addition to these requirements each system must have access to a shared super DLT320 tape drive or its own in order to facilitate the restoration of data from the primary site.  Each system must be of sufficiently small form factor so as not to incur additional costs due to space requirements in the cabinet.  Each system must also utilize RAID 1 or 5 in achieving the required drive space.

The web server must be a rack mountable Pentium single processor 2.4 GHz or higher with 2GB of RAM.  This system will be running Windows 2000, fully patched with sufficient virus protection.  Additionally it must have at least 2GB of free hard drive space not including the operating system.

The Verity server must be a rack mountable dual processor Pentium 3GHz or higher with 2GB of RAM.  This system should be running Windows 2000 server, fully patched with sufficient virus protection.  Additionally it must have at least 90GB of free hard drive space not including the operating system.

The FileNet/Oracle server must be a rack mountable dual processor 64bit 1.2 GHz or higher with 2 GB of RAM.  This system should be running AIX 5.2.  It must also have at least 1.2TB of internal or external storage available not including the operating system to load the optical disks into cache.

The FileNet system must have a direct connection to an optical jukebox with a 12” 30GB drive to facilitate loading of the FileNet cache to the hard drive or the ongoing access to 40 optical platters for document retrieval.

3.1.3 Software requirements. 3.1.3.1 GSS. The following commercial software must be installed and maintained for minimal operational status of the GSS.  All software will be provided by FERC.

•	Microsoft Exchange 2000
•	Windows 2000 Server
•	Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) version 81
•	Microsoft SQL 7.0
•	Microsoft SQL 2000
•	SharePoint Portal Server 2003

3.1.3.2 eLibrary. The following commercial software must be installed and maintained for minimal operational status of the eLibrary system.  All software will be provided by FERC.

•	Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) version 9i
•	AIX 5.2
•	FileNet Panagon Image Services 4.0
•	FileNet Web Services
•	Verity K2 Search Engine 4.0.1
•	AccuSoft NetVue 3.8
•	Informatix TiffDLL50
•	PKWare PKZip
•	Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, service pack 4

3.1.4 Resource requirements. The contractor’s staff must have the necessary skills to support the GSS and eLibrary system in the case of a disaster.  These shall include:

•	AIX administration and support
•	Exchange 2000 administration and support
•	SQL 7.0/2000 DBA
•	Oracle DBA
•	Windows administration and support
•	Network infrastructure administration and support
•	SharePoint administration and support

The contractor should also have trained and certified personnel to provide FileNet Image Services administration and support. FileNet is an integral technology in the eLibrary application and experience with it will insure a successful recovery of the system. A partnership with FileNet would be preferred since this indicates a level of experience and commitment to FileNet technologies.

4. DELIVERABLES. 4.1 Initial test plan and test results after each test. 4.2 Updated test plan to include lessons learned after each test. 4.3 Monthly monitoring reports.

5. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. The period of performance will be a two year base period with an additional two year option period.  The anticipated award date is January 28, 2005.  All systems must be in place and ready to undergo a disaster recovery test within 60 days of contract award.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to award a sole source contract to Microsoft Corporation of Charlotte, NC for Microsoft Premier Support.  This contract will be fixed price.  Since Microsoft applications are used through-out the Coast Guard, only Microsoft Premier Support can provide direct access to Microsoft software developers and proprietary source codes for current and future support.  Purchasing support from another vendor would not be cost effective.  The Coast Guard requires Microsoft to provide assistance for problems when specific symptoms are encountered while using NT 4.0 and a resolution is required.  Without the referenced support, the entire Coast Guard standard workstation infrastructure would be vulnerable.  Support Assistance includes: provide short-term advice, guidance and knowledge transfer for issues reported; and support provided remotely. This is a restricted solicitation.   SYNOPSIS AND SOLICITATION:   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSCG23-05-Q-TBX012, which is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-07.  NAICS code is 541511.  The period of performance for this acquisition is one year (January 01, 2005 through December 31, 2005).  The contractor shall provide technical support, as well as assistance in resolving problems when specific symptoms are encountered while using Microsoft NT 4.0.   Problem resolution support must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Problem resolution may include the following: a modification to Microsoft’s NT 4.0 software code, i.e. break-fix request or security vulnerability; and on-site support if needed.  Support Assistance includes: provide short-term advice, guidance and knowledge transfer for issues reported, and support provided remotely.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) provisions apply: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order-Commercial Items.  Responses shall include relevant thoroughly documented pricing and service information.  Quotes must be received by 2:00 P.M. EST on December 8, 2004 and should be e-mailed (any attachments should be in Word, Rich Tech Format, or PDF and must not exceed 2MB) to agreen-smith@comdt.uscg.mil or faxed to (202) 267-4475, ATTN. Augustine Green-Smith.  NOTICE TO OFFERORS-SOLICITATION OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM – It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolves them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  Potential offerors who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct concerns to the cognizant contracting Officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the offeror should contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman, at the following address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 Second Street, SW, Washington, DC 20593-0001, and FAX Number: 202-267-4011.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the response date, correct an error and address questions received and provide all interested parties with the Government's response.  

1.  The response date and time is hereby changed to 4:00pm, Eastern Standard Time, Thursday, October 28, 2004.  

2.  Block (iii) on Combined Solicitation number HQ0095-05-R-0003 has been corrected as follows:  This requirement is unrestricted.

3.  The following is a list of questions received and the Government's response.

Question:  Why does the contract require the vendor to make these transcripts available on Lexus-Nexus and is there any embargo time for this?   

Answer:  We use Lexus Nexus also to determine breaking news.  By providing transcripts to Lexus Nexus we ensure that breaking DoD news is available to the media.  

Question:  What is the approximate number of events that would need to be transcribed over the course of the year?  

Answer:  The best estimate would be a minimum of 150 major news briefings lasting at least 30 minutes.

Answer:  No.  

Question:  If not, will DOD provide a data/tape feed of any events outside the DC area?  

Answer:  Yes, DoD will provide a tape or wave file.  The contractor must be able to transcribe from digital or analog sources.
