This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

This notice of intent is not a request for competition.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground intends to negotiate the award of a sole source contract to Avon Protection Systems, Cadillac, MI for the development and subsequent testing of a modification kit for the M53 Chemical-Biological Protective Mask under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br><br>The requirement will be for the modification of the current M53 to add a new valve cassette assembly with pressure compensation capability and the inclusion of a valsalva device.  The modified M53 shall be capable of demonstrating pressure breathing for altitude capability up to 42,000 feet and operational competence under extreme conditions such as aircraft cabin decompressions.  Specifically the effort will involve completion of the modification kit design, validation testing of the design, and updating of production tooling as necessary.  The Government intends to procure 250 Modified M53 Masks for system level testing that will be completed under the proposed contract.  The contract will contain an option provision for additional logistics support products.  The Government does not possess a competitive Technical Data Package or Performance Specification that would allow for full and open competition of the Modified M53.  Avon Protection Systems owns the technical data and is therefore the only source capable of producing the modified M53 mask.  The total period of performance for this effort will be 24 months.<br><br>This is not a request for proposal.  Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.<br>

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Center - Fort Sam Houston (FSH) intends to issue a solicitation for the U.S. Army Wounded Soldier and Family Call Center for the U.S. Army Medical Command Medical Assistance Group (MMAG) located at Fort Sam Houston, TX.  The Chief of Staff of the Army activated The Wounded Soldiers and Family Hotline (WSFH) in 2007. The purpose of the WSFH is two-fold: 1) To offer wounded, injured, and ill Soldiers and family members a way to share concerns on the quality of patient care and 2) To provide Senior Army leaders with visibility on medically-related issues so they can properly allocate resources to better serve Soldiers and families. The contractor shall perform call center operation services, including performance of day to day operations for the Army Wounded Soldier and Family Hotline program under MMAG. The contractor shall provide personnel to service a 24 hour hotline 7 days a week with incoming call volume estimated at approximately 200 calls per week. The contractor shall utilize the toll free call line to respond to Army families, Soldiers, Retirees, Veterans, and Disabled Soldiers (beneficiaries) who are seeking information, or medical administrative issues.  Specific areas of expertise include, but are not limited to, superb communication skills, call center and customer service operations; knowledge of Soldier and Family member issues/concerns and the skills needed to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of processing the caller's request for assistance. Previous military experience, specifically Army Medical Department knowledge, is desirable. The contractor is responsible for preparing workload/caseload reports, providing analysis and trending reports, preparing information papers and other reports as requested by the MMAG. In addition, the contractor shall market the WSFH existence and functions to inform the military community they serve. The Government may identify other Soldier program initiatives involving call center capabilities or services during the period of performance.  This is a follow-on requirement. The current contract is W91WAW-08-C-0006.  The designated NAICS Code is 561110, Office Administrative Services, with a size standard of $7.0 million.  This acquisition anticipates a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside.  The contract type is FFP.  The Government anticipates a contract length of a 12 month base period and three (3) one-year option periods.  The solicitation and resultant contract will contain FAR 52.217-8, Extension of Services, which will be evaluated as part of the contract.  However, the extension period is not reflected in the period of performance.  The solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) utilizing FAR Part 15, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).  The Government anticipates release of the solicitation on or about 28 October 2011, with a projected closing date of 28 November 2011.  These are projected dates and are subject to change.

The Contractor shall perform this work in compliance with all terms, specifications, and provisions of this contract. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies (except those designated as Government-furnished), and incidentals necessary to perform fuel reduction services on the designated areas.
<p>Fuel loading may be reduced through the removal of the material from the sites for utilization or through the creation of machine piles on-site, which would then be treated by the Forest Service to complete fuel reduction. The Forest Service prefers to have as much material as possible removed from the site.</p>

The GTRP provides resources in the areas of preclinical and clinical-grade vector production in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and in the conduct of pharmacology/toxicology studies. In addition, the GTRP provides funds and regulatory assistance to investigators wishing to conduct gene therapy clinical trials. The GTRP consists of a clinical coordinating center that oversees and coordinates the logistics of the core laboratories and provides regulatory assistance for clinical trials; a preclinical-grade vector production core laboratory; a clinical-grade vector production core laboratory for adeno-associated virus (AAV); a clinical-grade vector production core laboratory for lentivirus; and a pharmacology/toxicology core laboratory. The CCC will continue to 1) participate in the Steering Committee (SC), and subcommittees as necessary, and attend SC meetings and participate in teleconferences, 2) schedule and coordinate the logistics of meetings, teleconferences, site visits and other face-to-face meetings between groups associated with conduct of the study, 3) develop, in collaboration with the SC, forms to be used by the Core Laboratories and investigators, 4) establish, in collaboration with the SC, and maintain an electronic database for use in capturing information conveyed to and from groups associated with the study, 5) develop, maintain and update a secure and password-protected Internet web site with pages for each of the Core Laboratories, 6) ensure that each Core Laboratory continually possesses all required certifications, inspections, and assurances, 7) develop and maintain a Manual of Procedures (MOP), 8) receive and process investigators' requests for vector production, pharmacological and/or toxicological studies, and clinical trials support services, 9) handle travel-related expense reimbursements for study-associated group members to attend meetings and site visits, 10) ensure that investigators have obtained, when necessary, regulatory approvals (i.e., IRB, IBC, RAC, NIH OBA) and had contact with or obtained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, 11) act as the conduit for funding of clinical trials which have been approved by the NHLBI as part of the program, and 12) register all GTRP clinical trials on the ClinicalTrials.gov web site.

<DESC><p>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is looking for Research &amp; Development to advance technology development of mature in vitro diagnostic devices that are amenable to military hardening and integration with communication capabilities to support the biosurveillance needs of the US military.</p>
<p><strong>Desired Design and Performance Capabilities</strong>:</p>
<p>The Government is interested in proposals offering innovative approaches for in vitro diagnostics devices (technology readiness level, TRL 5 or greater and a TRL of 7 after 24 months of funded R&amp;D; See Appendix A for assay-type TRL definitions) for the following two use cases:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Role 0</span></strong>:&nbsp;Highly robust self-collection and presumptive diagnostic screening modality (analogous to home glucose or pregnancy testing), medical diagnostic devices demonstrating CLIA-waived status (i.e., low complexity), specifically for use in austere environments and capable of entry to "telemedicine/remote consultation" electronic treatment/management hierarchy and defined reflexivity to higher level of care.&nbsp;Such a device should demonstrate sufficient analytical sensitivity and negative predictive value for infectious disease screening applications.&nbsp;No assumption should be made by Offerors as the mode of communication (e.g., telemedicine) of the analytical result.&nbsp;The only requirement is that the communication of the resulting analytical data is possible via electronic means (e.g., voice, text message, email, image et cetera), and that the algorithm by which the diagnostic information is generated and provided to the patient and physician, be remote to the device itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Role 1</span></strong>:&nbsp;Handheld and CLIA-waived/waiver-capable diagnostic devices/analyzers that are more highly multiplexed and designed for diagnostic/confirmatory field use by a medically trained operator in a "primary care" setting (i.e., field clinic, urgent care facility, Level 1 Medical Treatment Facility,&nbsp;Shock Trauma Platoon, etc. ). Important assumptions for these environments include that they no surgical or patient holding capability, are manned by a Physician, Physician Assistant (PA), or Medic, with the mission of providing triage, and treatment to return military personnel to duty, or stabilizing them for evacuation to the next level care facility (may be chemical &amp; biological protected).&nbsp;Devices should demonstrate sufficient analytical sensitivity, specificity and total (positive and negative) predictive value for infectious disease diagnostic and confirmatory applications.</p>
<p>In both cases, proposals are sought for medical diagnostic devices that have been designed to deliver information that will be used to facilitate the diagnosis of diseases whose origin is an infectious agent pathogen or toxin (organized as panels by syndromic presentation or pathogen class),and/or biomarkers of exposure to said agents.&nbsp;Analytes of interest include both pathogen and pathogen class-differential diagnostic markers.&nbsp;The ability to differentiate between pathogens such as Malaria (specifically P. falciparum), Arboviral diseases (e.g. dengue, chikungunya, etc.), Typhoid, Arenaviral&nbsp;diseases, Rickettsial diseases, Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) (including arenaviruses above), Plague, Q fever (Coxiella burnetti), Tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and Anthrax(B. anthracis) is desirable.</p>
<p>It is not a requirement that the device technology fulfilling the requirements outlined in Role 0 or Role 1 above be specifically designed for these pathogens/diseases, but it is preferable that the technology be adaptable to such pathogens/diseases. One specific matrix of interest is blood with either a finger prick or venous blood draw by a medic or trained medical personnel. It is not a requirement that the device technology be designed for a blood matrix but it is preferable that it be adaptable enough to enable diagnostics on a blood matrix.<br /><br />NRL will work cooperatively with the Offeror to test and verify performance of the devices <br />and to assist in the integration of the diagnostic devices with communication and device hardening for field application.</p>
<p>Additional background information may be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=eb0d8db0d46f190ee282a8e70b7ef768&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=eb0d8db0d46f190ee282a8e70b7ef768&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance</strong>:</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the 24-Month Challenge program shall provide up to two years of funding for research and development through competitive prototyping. The timeline will be divided into a Base Period of no more than 7 months, an additional Option 1 phase of 7-8 months, and a final Option 2 phase of 7-8 months. These phases include device development, testing and demonstration, evaluation, reporting, and selection activities. Selection of device candidates to be advanced into the Option 1 and Option 2 phases will be based on specific parameters and metrics being successfully met in demonstration exercises. The government shall provide technical data and support for demonstrations, as well as facilitate interaction with relevant DoD and Interagency stakeholders. The following presents a timeline that lists the anticipated sequence of major milestones for this program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 Jan 2013: Prototype I testing completed - Base period complete<br />31 Jan 2013: Down selection,&nbsp;Initiate Prototype II development - Option 1 awarded<br />28 Jun 2013: Prototype II testing completed - Option 1 complete<br />30 Aug 2013: Down select - Operational demo - Option 2 awarded <br />28 Feb 2014: Operational demo completed - Option 2 complete</p>
<p><strong>Award</strong>:</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make single or multiple awards. It is anticipated that award will be in the form of a cooperative agreement.&nbsp;The total amount of funding available is approximately $2M.</p>

<DESC>Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This will be a new firm-fixed-price agreement for six months. One of the primary aims of Dr. Nancy Bernardy's research study, "Development of strategies to improve evidence-based care for PTSD: Decreasing benzodiazepine treatment", is to find out what the barriers and facilitators of adherence to Clinical Practice Guidelines recommendations regarding medications prescribed for PTSD are. This aim will be addressed through the development and use of an online survey of VA prescribers across the country. Statistical analysis of the survey data will be conducted. 
1.	There will be four primary steps to this survey research project: 
Consultation and design of the survey instrument. The contractor will work with the research team to identify the necessary content and structural design of the survey instrument.  They will take the lead working with the NCPTSD research team to prepare a draft of the survey instrument, solicit feedback from key stakeholders, and produce a final survey that can be completed online using Survey Monkey or other approved survey technology for VA providers.  The questions will be designed to specifically capture the barriers and facilitators of adherence to the 2010 PTSD Clinical Practice Guidelines as well as capturing current treatment practices, to include pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy treatments. The survey will be approximately 20 minutes in duration.
Consultation on sampling methodology. The contractor will take the lead working with the NCPTSD research team to develop a sampling methodology that addresses specific aims of the research to contact prescribers in primary care and in mental health departments.  Unique features of the survey are interpreting the qualitative interviews that have been conducted to inform the content of the national survey.  The contractor will determine the number of providers that need to be contacted and the number of completed interviews needed to adequately generalize to our target population and provide appropriate power for statistical analyses.  The contractor will be available throughout the survey recruitment and implementation phase of this study to answer questions and provide guidance to the team on best sampling design and recruitment strategies. 
Cleaned SPSS data set.   Once data have been collected by the NCPTSD, the NCPTSD research team will deliver a copy of the de-identified data to the contractor.  The contractor will be responsible for producing a cleaned SPSS data set, including any calculated variables agreed upon by the NCPTSD research team. The contractor will also develop a data codebook specific to this dataset which will be delivered to the NCPTSD research team. 
Statistical Analysis.  The contractor will determine what statistical analysis is appropriate for this dataset, and will conduct these analyses. A summary report of the research analyses will be delivered at the end of the project to the NCPTSD research team.

<DESC>The Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) Space &amp; C3I Division Combat Support Branch (GHSC) is soliciting information to identify possible sources to provide a threat simulating radar system capable of simultaneous tracking and engagement of multiple targets, to support Air Combat Command's (ACC) Range Requirements Branch's (ACC/A8TR) next generation aircrew training requirements. The Request For Information (RFI) is issued for informational purposes only focusing on existing capabilities, e.g., matured technologies and fielded systems. This RFI does not constitute or commit the government to award a contract now or in the future. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary and respondents will not be compensated. Your company's response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or Government's use of such information.
<p>The radar system will need to address new capabilities desired by ACC to provide live aircrew training against multiple, integrated, "advanced double-digit" Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) system threat simulations denying blue force ability to penetrate and operate with persistence in enemy airspace. The System will provide accurate, timely, and target-quality data to training cadre and decision makers. Responses must contain specific and detailed explanations to the following questions.</p>
<p>Can your system produce threat representative radar signals to include effective radiated power, waveform scheduling, beam steering, and antenna patterns to include main beam and first order side lobes? Can your company provide these capabilities and what is the solution?</p>
<p>Is your system capable of threat representative radar skin tracking to include accomplishing multiple, simultaneous aircraft track and engagement scenarios? Can your company provide this and what is your company's solution?</p>
<p>Is your system capable of threat representative reactivity to include representative receiving, processing and electronic counter-counter-measure capabilities to provide accurate reactions to aircrew and aircraft defensive tactics, techniques and procedures? Can your company provide this and what is the solution?</p>
<p>Can your system replicate the physical threat representative multi-spectral (Electro-optical, Infrared, and Radar Cross Section) signatures located in close proximity to the radar signal emitter? Can your company provide this capability and what is the solution?</p>
<p>Can the system achieve self or towed mobility? Is your system able to integrate into existing training range communications networks and Digital Integrated Air Defense Systems (DIADS)? Can your company provide this and what is the solution? How can the system accomplish this?</p>
<p>There is a possibility that this program may include multiple agencies, so please include your company's stance on partnering and include details on possible collaborations.</p>
<p>The term "Threat Representative" is defined by the system specifications detailed in the system's associated ITEAMS report developed by the Missile &amp; Space Intelligence Center (MSIC). If the requirements above are met, it is strongly recommended that a rough cost estimate and schedule be included in the response. If you need to develop this system, please give an estimated timeframe in years and months that it would take to complete. Also, for streamline purposes please include a total capability statement as well. The opportunity for a capability briefing will be full and open to all companies that can answer with solutions to all the questions. Again this RFI is requesting mature and available solutions to meet these requirements.<br /><br />To set up a capability briefing and submit information please contact:<br />Corey Muir<br />corey.muir@hill.af.mil<br />801-775-3748</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is soliciting informationto conduct market research to improve its understanding of the current state-of-the-artin commercially-available space-rated ranging systems. NASA is seeking broad informationabout systems previously flown, systems currently in developmentincluding for othernon-NASA missionsand future technologies that are relevant to long-duration spacecraftmissions designed to operate in both low-Earth orbit (LEO) and geosynchronous orbit(GSO).In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), the information requested is for planning purposes onlyand is not intended to bind the Government.1. Background and Study Plan:NASAs Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office (SSCO) is currently studying thefeasibility, practicality, and cost of operating a long-duration autonomous rendezvous,proximity operations, and capture mission in GSO. One particular area of interest is theavailability of space-rated electromagnetic radiation-based relative ranging systems(laser range finders, lidars, and radars) suitable for the GSO environment. Early resultsof our study show that availability of direct range measurements between a chaser andtarget spacecraft is critical to mission success. Through this request for information (RFI), SSCO wants to survey the currentstate-of-the-art of available ranging systems and seeks relevant and interested industrypartners to develop an appropriate system. At this time, GSFC does not have a preferredranging techniquelaser range finder, flash or scanning lidar, radar, etc.nor preferredoutput measurement typecalibrated point clouds or voxels, range/bearing estimate, or sixdegree relative position and orientation. The systems performance, Technology ReadinessLevel (TRL), spaceflight heritage, developmental lead-time, cost, delivery schedule, andapplicability to the mission are the most important specifications at this point in time.Of sole interest are ranging systems that can be used non-cooperatively, that is, withoutthe use of active or passive targeting aides on the target vehicle. Most missionsrequiring rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) completed in recent years have reliedon target aides like laser retro-reflectors or a bi-directional communications link.Shuttle, ATV, and HTV rendezvous to ISS all fit this cooperative paradigm. We expect thatsome ranging devices used for these missions can also be used non-cooperatively.Furthermore, some RPO demonstrations have been recently completed where non-cooperativedevices and algorithms have been used. Information on these ranging systems is ofparticular interest to GSFC. 2. Ranging System Descriptions:There are several different types of direct ranging systems that could be utilized for ageosynchronous satellite-servicing vehicle.Laser Range Finder: A system consisting of a photon source (such as a laser), a photondetector, and a timing circuit. The distance to a target is derived from the time offlight (TOF) between when a photon (in many cases, multiple photons) is emitted from thesource and when the detector senses the same photon(s). The TOF is divided by the speedof light to produce measured range. These types of systems produce a range measurementonly. Most often, transmit and receive optics are used to focus the outgoing and incomingphotons, respectively. Flash Lidar: A system consisting of a wide-angle photon source and a one- ortwo-dimensional focal plane array of multiple photon detectors. These systems typicallyoperate under the same TOF principle of a laser range finder, but instead give a one- ortwo-dimensional range image, where each range measurement is acquired simultaneously.Some flash lidar systems determine range though phase shift detection of a modulatedcontinuous wave signal. The focal plane array may also return a laser intensity image.The operational concept is similar to a flash camera: the laser flashes the scene, andthe range image is recorded on the detector array.Scanning Lidar: These systems are similar to a laser range finder except the directionof the laser beam can be steered with respect to a stationary measurement frame. Thescanning mechanism can be a pan    ilt mechanism, a pair of high-speed steering mirrors,an electronically steered beam, etc. Because of the scanning capability, these systemsprovide 3D measurements: range, azimuth, and elevation. Each range and bearingmeasurement must be tagged individually with a time of measurement. Scanning lidars canmeasure range using multiple techniques, e.g., through TOF principles or triangulationgeometry. Radio/Microwave Radar: These systems are similar to flash lidar systems except the lasersource and detector are replaced by transmit and receive antennas and electronics. Theseradar systems offer many ways to detect range such as using the time of flight principleor through detecting phase shifts in a modulated continuous wave signal. Many suchsystems also provide a range-rate measurement. Some systems can provide line of sight (LOS) information through gimbaled antennae or phased-array antenna systems. 3. Measurement Types:In addition to the numerous ranging technologies listed above, a ranging system couldoutput one of many data output types. Range Only: This measurement is self-explanatory. The ranging device will provide asingle (or multiple) range measurement for all objects in the effective field of view(FOV) of the system. When the system times out, indicating that no objects are in theFOV, a notification is sent to the user.Range/Bearing triplets: This measurement adds directional information to the basic rangemeasurement. The assumption here is that the device is giving one range and bearingmeasurement for each distinct object in the effective FOV (or, on simpler systems, onemeasurement for all objects). Range and bearing is only one of many parameterizationspossible for LOS information.Voxel Sets: This type is also a three-dimensional measurement but is distinctlydifferent from the range/bearing measurement given above. Here, multiple measurements fora single target are given instead of just a single estimate. It is assumed that eachvoxel triplet is measured at different times and no constraint is placed on the structureor spacing of the bearing portion of the measurement.Point Clouds: Closely related to a voxel group, a point cloud also provides multiplethree-dimensional measurements for a single target but it is assumed that allmeasurements are taken simultaneously. Most of the time, the spacing of the bearingportion of the measurement is fixed and rectilinear. 6DOF Pose: This measurement type provides a full estimate of a targets position andattitude relative to the sensor. Obviously this is the most processed form of measurementand the most directly useable to a spacecraft navigation system. Most systems providingthis type of measurement require information on the target vehicle. 4. General Specifications:The following general specifications are to be considered for all of the ranging systemsmentioned above except where noted otherwise.Availability: GSFC is interested in flying ranging systems that are already indevelopment or have a successful flight heritage, however, we expect some developmentwill be required to fill gaps between our mission requirements and the as-builtspecifications of off-the-shelf units. Development/Flight Units:              -Emulator(s): Input/output emulators are required. Such	emulators shall mimic theoperation of flight software as well as mimic the flight hardware command and telemetryinterfaces.        -Engineering Development Unit(EDU): A high fidelity EDU of the ranging system isrequired. Such an EDU shall use electronic parts of similar form, fit, and function asthe flight unit. The embedded software in the EDU shall be flight-like.	-Engineering Test Unit(ETU): New hardware developed under this effort shallrequire an ETU to verify survivability in the space environment. Such an ETU shall useflight-qualified electrical and mechanical parts in all areas. Any electrical,electronic, and electromechanical (EEE) parts used would be qualified for flight butflight screening is optional.	-Flight Unit(s): Final version of the hardware that will be used in the spaceenvironment. All parts, materials, and processes would be flight qualified. Operational Lifespan: 5 years. Radiation: GSFC has not chosen a specific radiation model, but many models exist in theliterature, such as the AE-9/AP-9 radiation specification model, to provide a startingpoint for the GSO environment. Respondents should assume an inclination of +/-7 degrees.System designers should take steps to ensure the survivability of the optics, detectors,lasers and accompanying electronics in a typical radiation environment for the missionlifespan. Other potential client orbits are also being investigated so respondents shouldreport on their systems applicability in other altitude regimes as well.Survival Temperatures: Thermal limitations will depend directly on the inclination ofthe spacecraft orbit and structure surrounding the ranging system. Internal componentsare likely to set the survivability temperatures for the units themselves. If certaincomponents within the ranging system are temperature sensitive, the system shouldregulate those temperatures through heaters or coolers. Power used for such devices mustbe included in worst-case maximum power numbers. Thermal blanketing may also be useddepending on the final temperature limitations of the hardware.   Launch Loads: To be determined by launch vehicle. Standard GSFC General EnvironmentalVerification Specification (GEVS) for a generic expendable launch vehicle shall apply.5. Disclaimer:It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtainedduring this solicitation. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedomof Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondentas Proprietary or Confidential will be kept confidential.  The Government shall not beheld liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properlyidentified.

The NAICS code is 485991, and the size standard is $7.0 million. Submission date to Contracting Officer by email at joe.little@va.gov is required by 5/18/2012.  NO  phone calls will be accepted.  This is not a request for proposal, nor an offer. 
 
 DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK 
1.	Furnish 24-hour ambulance transportation service for the beneficiaries of the VA Medical Center, Leestown Road and Cooper Drive Divisions, Lexington, Kentucky.  This will involve trips to and from any location within the Primary Service Area (PSA) of the Lexington VA Medical Center and beyond, as appropriate.  Trips are generally confined to within the PSA; however, they may encompass travel to points as far away as Richmond, Virginia, or beyond, if necessary.

2.	NUMBER OF PATIENTS:  It is understood and agreed that only ONE patient will be transported on a trip unless specifically authorized or requested by the VA.  When, pursuant to Department of Veterans Affairs authorization, more than one patient is transported concurrently on a trip, reimbursement shall be made only at the rates contained in the schedule of costs for transporting a single patient.  Regardless of the number of patients transported concurrently on a single trip within Fayette County limits, the Contractor shall be reimbursed for only the Base Rate (Item 1) for one trip.  Regardless of the number of patients transported concurrently on a single trip beyond Fayette County limits, the Contractor shall be reimbursed for the Mileage Rate (Item 2) for only one trip to the longest distance traveled with any one patient on that particular trip.

3.	WAITING TIME:  For time lost in waiting at either or both ends of a trip due to causes beyond the Contractor's control, the Contractor will be reimbursed per quarter hour as quoted in the schedule for each quarter hour or fraction thereof in excess of one-quarter hour for the time reported to the designated VA personnel.  If the pick-up point is other than the VA Medical Center; the Contractor will call the Travel Clerk first, (859) 281-4951 or Supervisor, Patient Support Unit (859) 233-4511 extension 4373 during administrative hours (8:00AM through 4:30PM, Monday through Friday) or the Administrative Officer of the Day (AOD) at (859) 281-4950 on duty during non-administrative hours (during evenings, nights, weekends, and holidays) as soon as it is anticipated that a delay may develop for which the Contractor expects to claim reimbursement.  This call is only for the purpose of verifying the arrival time at the pick-up point and is not necessary if the Contractor anticipates no delay for which reimbursement will be claimed.  The Contractor's failure to notify the travel section when waiting beyond the grace period shall result in non-payment for waiting time.

4.	COMPLETED TRIP:  When ambulance service under the terms of this contract involves pick-up of a patient who is to be brought to this medical center or to another hospital and/or clinic for hospitalization or treatment, the trip will be considered complete when the patient is delivered by ambulance personnel to the admitting/evaluation unit, a specified ward or unit, or to the location specified at the time the trip is requested.

5.	NON-PICKUP OF PATIENT:  When ambulance service involves a trip to or from this medical center, patient's residence or patient refusal, but due to unforeseen circumstances the patient is not available for pick-up, the Contractor will collect for the trip at the rates applicable under the schedule portion of this contract.  The VA reserves the right to substitute patients in these instances to prevent the "no-load" situation.

6.	NON-ARRIVAL OF PATIENT:  When ambulance service involves the pick-up of a patient scheduled to arrive by air and the ambulance driver finds such patient does not arrive as scheduled, the ambulance driver will contact the Travel Clerk, Supervisor, Patient Support Unit, or the AOD and inquire as to the status of the arrival.  If appropriate, waiting time may be authorized for time lost in waiting in accordance with the rate applicable under the schedule of costs of this contract.  If Contractor reported as scheduled and no patient is transported, Contractor will be reimbursed at the rates applicable under the schedule of costs of this contract.

7.	RATES:  Rates will apply twenty-four hours per day seven days a week.  Payment for mileage traveled beyond the county limits will be limited to "One Way Only" for the distance over which the patient is transported.  Such mileage costs will be paid in addition to the applicable rate per trip for any trip entirely within the county limits.  Trip mileage shall be determined by the latest edition of the Yahoo.Com Maps.  The Contractor shall receive the base rate quoted in the schedule for all one-way trips ordered.  The base rate shall constitute full compensation for one-way trips which do not exceed the mileage threshold as defined herein.  The Contractor shall also receive reimbursement of mileage charges for any mileage less than the mileage threshold.  The odometer reading at the time of the county line is crossed shall be provided and the odometer reading at the arrival of destination.

8.	PAYMENT:  Upon receipt of itemized statement payment will be processed.  If itemized statement is not received a 5% penalty will be accessed based on the total monthly bill.  Itemized statement includes date, patient's name, social security number, from and to mileage, ALS or BLS, oxygen, charges are to be broken down for each run, total charge each run, and total charge per month.

An optical microscope capable of determining precise lateral and height dimensions of such samples is required. The microscope should employ either white-light interferometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy, or both to create three dimensional scans of samples with the ability to discern a 20 nm step in height and lateral dimensions of 350 nm. In addition, the microscope should have the ability to take a true color image of the sample of interest. The microscope should have a turret capable of holding at least 4 microscope objectives. These microscope objectives should be parfocal with each other. The microscope should be capable of bright -field, dark-field (oblique illumination) reflected light imaging. The objective selection (turret position) should be motorized as should the stage position. In addition, all contrast mechanisms available on the microscope should be listed. Only new products should be considered. No refurbished or used products will be considered.</p>
<p>HEIGHT RESOLUTION:</p>
<p>The microscope should be capable of measuring a thin film step height of 20 nm with a repeatability of at least 20 nm (one standard deviation) for a reflective thin film of lateral dimensions 1 um x 1 um. In addition, the maximum measurable height should be at least 7 mm, as configured. Special considerations will be given for products exceeding this level of height resolution or products capable of accurately measuring height on features having lateral dimensions smaller than 0.35 um x 0.35um.</p>
<p>LATERAL RESOLUTION:</p>
<p>The microscope should have the ability to measure lateral dimensions of a reflective film with a resolution of at least 350 nm with a repeatability of 20 nm or smaller (three standard deviations). Lateral resolution is more important than height resolution in consideration of solutions.</p>

<p>1) The sample stage should be fully automated with a x, y translation of at least 70 mm, and be capable of accepting at least a 100 mm (4") diameter round sample. The stage should move with a reproducibility of +- 1 um and an accuracy of +- 3 um. All accessories needed to control the stage either through software (mouse control) or external hardware (external joystick should be included.</p>
<p>SOFTWARE:</p>
<p>The microscope will be used by a variety of scientists and software usability is a key concern. The software used to operate the microscope must also be capable of creating three dimensional maps. Software should be capable of measuring surface roughness of an area or line of interest. The software should be able to create a "stitched" or "mosaic" image composed of several images of high resolution, creating a field of view exceeding that of a single objective. The software should capable of exporting images in one of the following electronic formats; tagged image format (tiff), portable network graphic format (png), or Joint Photographic Experts Group (jpg). Additionally, any software upgrade required to measure the thickness of thin transparent films or surfaces under such films should be included. The software should be Windows compatible (XP or Windows 7).</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT:</p>
<p>The contractor will need to include all software and hardware accessories required for a fully functional system including a control computer and all interfacing hardware.</p>

Every year, VeHU highlights innovations towards patient care through training classes on VHA's clinical informatics products.  

VHA OIA has recognized the need for alternative means to traditional F2F forums, meetings, and conferences.  VHA OIA has an on-going obligation to continue providing educational resources to our VHA Staff and clinical trainees and is focused on delivering alternative technologies such as the increased use of immersive on-line education virtual environments and webcasting. 

The following contracting initiative shall provide VHA OIA and the MyVeHU Campus learning community with the necessary production and webcasting resources to expand its reach and deliver live, interactive and on-demand training and education to larger audiences in near real time, and at a greatly reduced cost.  MyVeHU Campus membership is currently at over 6500 and will continue to grow in membership and value as our streaming initiatives expand.

It is the intent of VHA OIA to enter into a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with a selected and qualified contractor currently holding a 541 AIMS GSA contract for the performance work identified herein. Actual performance will be ordered via specific event related task orders issued by a VHA OIA Contracting Officer. All orders under this BPA must be performed by the selected BPA Contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions contained herein, and in accordance with the requirements included in individual task orders issued under this BPA. 

All staff provided by the contractor shall be direct employees of the Contractor or employees of an approved subcontractor.  The Contractor shall have full responsibility for the staff and shall make direct contact with VHA OIA's Contracting Officer, COTR, Project Manager, or Project Coordinator to ensure that all arrangements are mutually understood concerning any logistical and/or technical requirements.

Requirements

VHA OIA requires services in support of on-line immersive streaming and webcasting services offering interactive networking features that will enable online users to interact with the speakers, presenters, or panelists and make it cost effective to hold live, interactive and immersive virtual and hybrid meetings where participant numbers range from 50 attendees to a few thousand.  By combining webcasting and interactive networking services, VHA OIA will improve productivity and training, communicate more efficiently and reach VHA Staff and clinical trainees that might not be able to attend a F2F event in person, and do so at a greatly reduced overall cost per person.   

In addition to the live and on-demand streaming and webcasting requirements, VHA OIA requires associated video pre-production, production and post production services to include:

"	Web development
"	Broadcast studio facilities
"	Lighting for high quality videography
"	Creation and generation of immersive virtual sets
"	On demand event production and access to all webcasts posted to MVC by contractor within five days of every event
"	Live and On Demand open captioning
"	Graphics / motion media development
"	Lower third graphics and titles
"	Faculty and administrative staff credits - broadcast live and on demand
"	Technical and creative development support services
"	Program reporting

VA employees and MVC registrants must be able to view the webcast over the Internet or through VPN access, bandwidth dependent. VHA OIA requires that the Contractor coordinate Internet security settings and provide IP addresses and/or applicable information upon award of each order. Contractor's Webcast must be accessible from VA workstations, mobile devices or personal computers both in and outside of the VA networks. 

VHA OIA's Virtual and Hybrid meetings typically will feature multiple speakers and panels, and an open discussion to include display (projection) of PowerPoint presentations and other documents and media. The Contractor shall utilize professional videographers with appropriate cameras (High Definition - HD format unless otherwise specified) and related equipment, to facilitate a high quality production effort. In addition, the remote participants must be able to view and download the documents presented at the meeting which will be made available to the Contractor in advance for uploading to the site.  An easy to use GUI to allow access to the downloads and other network features will be required. All documentation must be made available in a clear visible format, as allowed by remote sites bandwidth, during the live webcast and the on-demand access period through MVC.

This announcement constitutes the only notice.This is not a request for quotes.A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Responses must be received no later than Friday, May 14, 2012 by sending an e-mail to almeda_gaddis@fws.gov; however, any technical data received will be for the sole purpose of market research for future requirements.Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Fish & Wildlife Services, Region 7 Contracting and General Services intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price order to:COMPANY:	Telonics, Inc,  FOR :	Purchase APO-12- GPS ARGOS Moose Radio Collar to continue monitoring of moose spatial use as part of the Alaska Peninsula Moose Project.ON:	05/14/2012NAICS:	334220	GPS (global positioning system) equipment manufacturingAUTHORITY:	8.405-6(a)(2) Limited Sources Justification and Approval13.106(b) Soliciting from a single sourceDeterminations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because:Telonics Inc. has provided moose collars for the Alaska Peninsula Moose Project since the project was initiated during 2008.  The requested collars are needed for the continuation of this project and continued collection of data from moose already equipped with Telonics collars. Continued use of Telonics collars on these individuals assures data integrity and maintains consistent data collection throughout the lifetime of the project which is imperative in scientific studies of wildlife.  In addition, currently owned data transfer and processing software and equipment are set up to process data generated only by Telonics collars. Currently owned visual markers (which are attached to collars prior to deployment) are also custom built to properly fit the currently deployed and requested Telonics GPS radio-collars.  Purchase of collars other than those requested would necessitate the acquisition of additional data download software, transfer software, download equipment, visual markers, and would not ensure continued data consistency and integrity.

<DESC>The Forest Service intends to award a HUBZone sole source contract to Roadtech Inc. under Negotiated Procedures for the purchase of a mobile rock crusher. This requirement is proposed to be a sole source procurement to a certified HUBZone company under the authority of the HUBZone Act of 1997 (15 U.S.C. 631 note) and FAR 19.1302. Justification for such procedures: This type of machine is less expensive to operate, recycles previously unsuitable material on site thereby eliminating disposal problems, can operate on small single lane roads, minimizes material handling and hauling costs, has low environmental impacts, and has the capability of blending soil stabilizers or dust abatement products into the road material. This method not only completely eliminates the costly removal and replacement of the material to be crushed, but can re-establish a native roadbed without spreading seeds and/or diseases from Forest to Forest. This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive proposals. If there are businesses that can provide the aforementioned product, and meet the minimum requirements listed below, they must respond by submitting in writing an expression of interest in competing on the procurement and provide supporting documentation as to how their proposed product meets the stated minimum requirements by May 18, 2012 at 10:00 a.m. MST. The mobile rock crusher must meet the following minimum requirements: The mobile rock crusher shall be capable of taking oversized rock that has been windrowed along the roadway and crush it as the machine progresses down the road. Operating sites may vary from steep, narrow mountain roads to developed pit sites. The machine shall be capable of blending all types of material, regardless of shape or hardness. Machine shall be capable of crushing rocks up to 16" to an aggregate graduation of &frac34;" minus. Mobile rock crusher shall be built to a size that does NOT require any oversize or overweight permits when being transported on State, County, or Federal Highway; crusher shall have adjustment capability of hammers and anvils to adjust for wear to increase the consistency of the aggregate produced; equipment shall be designed with a multi-position lift frame which allows the crusher head to be rotated so crews may work with the underside of the machine facing them at working level to increase safety; the crusher shall have shock protection to reduce vibration; have a removable anvil weldment for ease of service and repair, and the crusher shall have radial attachment of the tooling, which results in much easier and faster replacement of wear parts. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>Evaluation of Host-Targeted Bait Box, Select Tick Control System to Reduce Entomological Risk of Lyme Disease in a Lyme-Endemic Area of North Central New Jersey

<CONTACT>Linda M Young, Purchasing Agent, Phone (770) 488-2655, Fax (770) 488-2777, Email lml3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Terry L. Schulze, 9 Evergreen Court, Perrineville, NJ 08535 for Evaluation of the Host-Targeted Bait Box, Select Tick Control System (TCS) to reduce the Entomological Risk of Lyme Disease in a Lyme Endemic Area of North Central New Jersey. The Statement of Work is as follows:
<p>Background and Need - Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, and transmitted by the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the United States. Although chemical pesticides and repellents are available to combat these disease transmitting pests, many citizens are hesitant about the use of these pesticides due to concerns about short range toxicity and long range health problems attributed to these chemicals. DVBD scientists have developed host-targeted methods of controlling disease vectors thereby reducing populations of infected rodent reservoirs and questing ticks. Development of new, environmentally safe vector-control methods is a very high priority for DVBD and CDC. Because these DVBD patented, host-targeted bait boxes and other host-targeted technologies use such small amounts of pesticides enclosed in a box, they provide an especially eco-friendly method of vector-borne disease control in a residential setting. This is a win-win solution both for public health and the environment.</p>
<p>CDC, DVBD scientists have developed and patented a host-targeted device containing a wick system that delivers the acaricide fipronil. These boxes lure rodents inside using non-toxic bait where they are passively treated. A single visit to a bait box can protect small mammals from tick and flea infestations for &gt; 52 days. Initial studies were performed in DVBD laboratories followed by field trials in CT and most recently in NJ. A licensing agreement was recently signed with a tick control company and they have exclusive rights to the bait box technology (Tick Box Technology and Technology Transfer Office, CDC Atlanta). EPA required modifications to the originally patented design and we want to evaluate the newly registered Select Tick Control System&reg; (TCS) boxes. The study will allow us to determine the efficacy of three modifications made to the original design that was evaluated in NJ: the recently changed wick delivery system, the non-toxic monitoring bait, and the galvanized steel protective shroud (proprietary design of Connecticut Tick Control and Tick Box Technology, Norwalk, CT). This continuation of proposed field research studies will allow CDC/DVBD to determine the efficacy of the Select TCS to impact the entomological risk of tick-borne disease when used alone or part of an overall integrated tick management (ITM) approach. Insight gained from these trials will also allow DVBD to make recommendations on the utility and efficacy of this device as a viable tick control product for public health.</p>
<p>Project Objective - To evaluate the efficacy of modified Select TCS bait boxes containing the acaricide fipronil and the Connecticut Tick Control protective shroud device. The study will be conducted according to current product labeling and will determine the ability of these boxes as a stand-alone method of intervention to: 1) reduce tick infestation rates on small mammal reservoirs (Peromyscus leucopus, Tamias striatus, Sciurus carolinensis, and Blarina brevicauda), 2) reduce questing Ixodes scapularis tick populations, and 3) ability of host-targeted bait boxes to reduce infection rates in small mammal reservoirs as well as questing tick populations for both Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap).</p>
<p>Scope of Work - The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials and equipment necessary to evaluate the efficacy of Select TCS bait boxes. This will include but is not limited to all necessary equipment to perform rodent reservoir and questing tick evaluations. The vendor will need to have access to suitable tick/rodent/Lyme disease habitat with a minimum of 0.1 tick/m2 and adequate species of Peromyscus leucopus, Tamias striatus, Sciurus carolinensis, and Blarina brevicauda. The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials, processing equipment, live mammalian traps (Sherman and Tomahawk), bait boxes, and equipment necessary to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline impregnated rodent bait to reduce infected rodent reservoirs and infected questing ticks in residential areas. The vendor will identify suitable test plots for each study, conduct weekly pre- and post-treatment flagging and trapping of animals in plots to determine the ability of these host-targeted technologies to reduce infected reservoirs, reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases, and evaluate host-targeted deployment strategies, and assist with obtaining all isolates for evaluation by PCR and culture. Vendor will provide monthly reports and perform statistical analysis. All data will be sent to CDC/NCEZID/DVBD, Fort Collins, CO.</p>
<p>The DVBD contract PI will provide all additional equipment as needed to properly process and evaluate rodents and ticks for infection. This includes but is not limited to: BSK, specimen vials, animal processing equipment, tick collection and processing equipment, PCR analysis, culture and microscopy work, bait, bait boxes, shrouds, data collection, generation, and evaluation. The DVBD contract PI will oversee and assist grantees with all field trials until completed.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements - The vendor shall perform the following tasks in the order shown:</p>
<p>1) Locate, measure, and stake a total of 10 1-3 ha residential properties (&gt; 60% wooded) in Millstone Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey and at least 2 untreated control areas on Naval Weapons Station Earle, Colts Neck, NJ. The intervention and untreated areas must contain &gt; 1 tick/m2. Preliminary trapping surveys must be conducted on each property and show abundant populations of ticks and small mammal hosts. The study will evaluate Select TCS which is a 19.05 cm x 13.97 cm x 6.35 cm child-resistant plastic box containing a non-toxic monitoring bait and a fipronil-treated felt wick assembly (0.7% AI, 3 ml total volume). After entering the box, the small mammals travel down the central corridor and are passively treated as they contact the wick while attempting to access the bait chambers. A single treatment is effective in killing ticks on small mammals for &gt; 52 d.</p>
<p>All Select TCS bait boxes need to have the following modification done. A 2-piece, tightly fitting protective cover constructed of 0.032 gauge galvanized steel will need to be installed over each box. The top and bottom sections of the clam-shell cover and bait box will be secured together at 2 opposite corners by means of 20.3 cm cable ties. The protected shroud is a proprietary device of Connecticut Tick Control Services, LLC (1 Testa Place, Norwalk, CT 06854). Bait boxes will be deployed on treatment areas according to product label and in accordance with suitable small mammal habitat and pre-treatment trapping. Approximate description of deployment: bait boxes should be deployed along 2 concentric rings, with the first located within the forest at &plusmn; 10 m from the lawn edge with a &plusmn; 25-m interval between individual boxes. Wherever possible, boxes should be placed in proximity to likely small mammal foraging or nesting sites. Because the combined weight of the bait box and protective covering exceeded 1200 g and are judged too heavy to be easily displaced by nuisance wildlife, the boxes should not need tethering.</p>
<p>Pretreatment tick collections, flagging, and animal trapping will need to be completed in all areas before the end of May 2012. These plots will be sampled 2 times at weekly intervals to determine tick density, rodent density, rodent infestation rate, rodent infection rates, and tick infection rates prior to setting out bait boxes. Small mammals will be trapped using Sherman and Tomahawk live traps. All captures will be processed for materials and analyzed as follows: anesthetized, ear biopsied, bled by cheek punch, physical measurements recorded, ectoparisites removed and placed in ETOH, ear-tagged, and released at the capture site. Ear biopsies will be surface sterilized and cultured in BSK-H media for detection of live spirochetes by dark-field microscopy. Tick pools collected from rodents will be screened for infection by PCR. Both sites will be flagged for questing nymphal ticks. Ticks will be individually screened by PCR for infection with Bb. (Secondary future analysis will include PCR for Ap). Both areas will be flagged for questing ticks. Collected ticks will be recorded and analyzed by PCR.</p>
<p>Bait boxes will need to be visited monthly during nymphal and larval season deployment and weighed in the field using a portable balance. Any change in box orientation or damage to boxes, including the acaricide wicks, should be noted for later replacement or repair. All efficacy data will be recorded for each time point and data will be analyzed, statistical analysis performed, and written report provided to CDC. All laboratory and field work should be performed under "Good Laboratory Practices" (GLP) guidelines as set forth by FDA and EPA. Animal work will need to be performed under an approved IACUC protocol on file at CDC, DVBD, BDB.</p>
<p>Reporting Schedule - The period of performance shall commence upon receipt of a purchase order and shall continue for a period of 365 days.</p>
<p>Special Considerations - The vendor must be fully familiar with the process of evaluating tick control technologies including host-targeted devices and rodent baits in a field setting. This includes but is not limited to: applying of chemicals, safety measures, locating and identifying suitable tick habitat, marking plots, flagging for questing ticks, proper times and conditions to flag for ticks, knowledge of deer ticks, lone star ticks, and Lyme disease, knowledge of trapping rodents, processing rodent tissues by culture for infection, assaying ticks and small mammal sera by PCR, evaluating baits and tick control using host-targeted devices such as bait boxes. The vendor must be able to conduct the study at weekly intervals and evaluate data using statistical analysis including the Henderson method for comparing efficacy of treated vs. control plots.</p>
<p>Government Furnished Property -- See section C.3, Scope of Work paragraph 3.</p>
<p>Deliverables - The vendor shall provide the following deliverables to the project officer by the dates shown:</p>
<p>A. Locate, measure, stake 10, 1-3 ha properties in Perrineville, NJ and 2 untreated <br />plots at NWSE, all pre-treatment trapping and flagging of both treated &amp; un-treated plots.<br />Process mammal and tick specimens for infection. - Before the end of May, 2012.</p>
<p>B. Distribute bait boxes on treated properties during nymphal season. Bait boxes will be<br />monitored at monthly intervals.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.<br /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break;" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break;" /></span></p>

<p><br />Background Information</p>
<p>NIST has a series of food-matrix Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) with values assigned for nutrient values. These materials support the labeling requirements of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, and SRMs 3252 Protein Drink Mix and 3290 Dry Cat Food are part of this series. NIST is also working with the National Institutes of Health's Office and Dietary Supplements and the Food and Drug Administration to produce SRMs for dietary supplements. A suite of ginger is part of this series, and this Statement of Work describes the requirements for packaging two of these materials: SRMs 3398 Zingiber officinale (Ginger) Rhizome and 3399 Zingiber officnale (Ginger) Extract as well as SRMs 3252 Protein Drink Mix and 3290 Dry Cat Food. These materials must be packaged in argon- or nitrogen-flushed polyethylene heat-sealed bags inside argon- or nitrogen-flushed, heat-sealed Mylar pouches with packets of silica gel.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The contractor must package:</p>
<p>30 kg protein drink mix<br />30 kg cat food<br />5 kg powdered ginger rhizome<br />5 kg powdered ginger extract</p>
<p>The materials will be provided by NIST within 7 days after award. Bags of commercially available cat food, cans of commercially available drink mix, and plastic bags containing ginger rhizome and extract will be provided by the Government. These materials must be individually blended - i.e., a separate blend of protein drink mix, a separate blend of cat food, a separate blend of ginger rhizome, and a separate blend of ginger extract - and aliquots as specified below must be packaged in 4 mil polyethylene bags under dry nitrogen or argon. This polyethylene package must then be overpackaged in an aluminized packet with a suitable quantity of silica gel (e.g., two packets of SORB-IT) and dry nitrogen or argon. Additionally, the Contractor will be required to grind and sieve the cat food before blending and packaging. Protein drink mix and cat food must be packaged in 10.1 g aliquots. The ginger rhizome and extract must be packaged in 1.6 g aliquots. NIST expects to receive a minimum of 3,000 packets of protein drink mix, 3,000 packets of cat food, 3,000 packets of ginger rhizome, and 3,000 packets of ginger extract.</p>
<p>Specific Tasks:</p>
<p>Prior to packaging the protein powder, ginger rhizome, and ginger extract, the contractor shall individually blend the materials provided by NIST. These blends must be homogeneous for nutrients (in the case of the protein powder) and gingerols (in the case of the ginger materials.) Nominally 3,000 packets of protein drink mix, 3,000 packets of ginger rhizome, and 3,000 packets of ginger extract must be packaged. The contractor must acquire aluminized plastic packaging material (GP-48M/25 or equivalent), 4 mil polyethylene, and silica gel packets. Polyethylene packets must be flushed with dry nitrogen or argon and filled with 1.6 g of ginger rhizome, 1.6 g of ginger extract, or 10.1 g of protein powder with an accuracy of 0.1 g; i.e., packets must contain the specified mass +/- 0.1 g). Packets must be filled under controlled temperature and humidity conditions (e.g., glove box, controlled-humidity room) at 20 degrees Celsius to 25 degrees Celsius and 45 percent to 50 percent relative humidity, respectively. Polyethylene packets must be over packaged in the nitrogen- or argon-flushed aluminized plastic packets along with two silica gel packets. Packets must be transferred, in fill order, to a box that must be filled from back to front.</p>
<p>Prior to packaging the cat food, the contractor shall grind, sieve, and blend the cat food provided by NIST. The cat food must be ground to 1 mm particle size. The blended cat food must be homogenous for nutrients. Nominally 3,000 packets of cat food must be packaged in the aluminized plastic packaging material and polyethylene bags with silica gel packets as described above. Packets must be filled under controlled temperature and humidity conditions as described above, and will contain 10.1 g of cat food (+/- 0.1 g).</p>
<p>The back and front of each box must be marked, and boxes must be numbered sequentially. Boxes must be labeled to indicate their contents: SRMs 3398 Zingiber officinale (Ginger) Rhizome, 3399 Zingiber officnale (Ginger) Extract, 3252 Protein Drink Mix, and 3290 Dry Cat Food. Boxes must be placed on pallets and delivered to NIST at the contractor's expense.</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>Delivery of packaged material is required not later than 4 months from delivery of bulk materials to the contractor. Delivery of material in one to four shipments is acceptable.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities</p>
<p>NIST will provide the contractor with bulk ginger rhizome, ginger extract, protein powder, and cat food materials to be packaged</p>
<p>There may be somewhat more or less than the above-stated masses of starting materials and there may be losses incurred during packaging. Thus, if fewer than 3,000 packets of ginger rhizome, ginger extract, protein powder, or cat food, respectively, are received, NIST will pay only for the number of packets received. This order does not allow for overages.</p>
<p>Program Management and Control Requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor shall confirm throughout the packaging process that packets are appropriately filled and sealed and that boxes are appropriately labeled. The contractor will notify NIST if problems are encountered.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:</p>
<p>NIST will inspect the shipment of materials to confirm that materials have been packaged as described above.</p>
<p>NIST personnel will inspect the shipment of materials. Acceptance of the materials will be based on the following:</p>
<p>1. Materials have been packaged as described in the Statement of Work and meet all specifications set forth in the Statement of Work.<br />2. All packets arrive intact and usable.</p>
<p>*** Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance, past experience and price shall be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, 3) Past Experience, and 4) Price. Technical capability and Past Performance, when combined, shall be approximately equal in importance to price. If Technical Capability and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation:</p>
<p>The contractor will demonstrate their understanding of the project and their ability to successfully complete the project. Technical capability shall be demonstrated through the proposed methodology, including a description of the contractor's plan for processing, assessing homogeneity, and packaging the materials.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>Past Performance evaluation shall be conducted to determine the overall quality of the products and services provided by the Contractor. Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on information provided by references and/or the Contractor's recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its affiliates. The Government reserves the right to contact references other than those provided by the Contractor. Provide contact information for references with similar requirements. Timeliness, quality, and customer service will be evaluated.</p>

 The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:

(i) Technical capability of the item quoted to meet the Government requirement
(ii) Customer responsiveness
(iii) Price

Technical capability and customer responsiveness will both be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. A quote that is considered technically unacceptable or a quoter that is determined to have inadequate customer responsiveness shall be ineligible for award. Customer responsiveness will be assessed based on past dealings between the quoter and the customer - Naval Submarine Base Point Loma. If the quoter has never dealt with this customer before, they will be considered to have adequate customer responsiveness for award purposes.
 Alternate customers apart from Naval Submarine Base Point Loma will not be surveyed to make a customer responsiveness determination. The lowest priced quote that is determined to be technically acceptable and submitted by a company with acceptable customer responsiveness shall be selected for award.

(b) Options (not applicable).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quotes specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
 

(d) Quoters shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. The price proposal shall state the unit cost and total price of the item required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above.

APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:
Quotes received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will make a quoter ineligible for award.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW):

Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)

Background:

The Amphibious Vehicle Test Branch (AVTB) has a primary charter to test amphibious military vehicles.
   The Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) reduces the requirement for human divers to collect test data and assess platform performance.  These observations can be critical to the safety of personnel conducting the test vehicle operation or confirming a required equipment function has occurred. The ROV can be used in assessing the test platform in recovery situations.

Scope:

The Vendor/Contractor shall provide one (1) Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle that meets the following specifications:

Specifications:

	Two person portable, and deployable

DELIVERY/SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS:   Prices shall be FOB destination with delivery to:

ATTN: Larry Baker
210536 Kraus Street
Camp Pendleton, California 92055-5217
  
Packaging and marking shall be in accordance with commercial industry practice. Required delivery date is within 30 days of contract award.
  Inspection and Acceptance shall be at destination by the Government.  

EVALUATION PROCEDURES/BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract. Award will be made to the responsible offeror who: A) meets all required technical specifications as determined by the Statement of Work,  and B) proposes the lowest price. Submitted information must address the requirements in the Statement of Work (SOW). Quotes must include a visual representation of the Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle. Initial offers should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

Offerors are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal.
 Only qualified responsible small business sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. 

APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant, if the offeror does not have an active ORCA and CCR registration status. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR required the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.
 With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire.

<p><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Mr. Bogdan Donciu<br />Romanian Air Traffic Services Administration<br />10, Ion Ionescu de la Brad Blvd<br />013813, Bucharest<br />Romania<br />Tel: 40-21-208-3102<br />Fax: 40-21-230-2335<br />Email: <a href="mailto:bogdan.donciu@mt.ro">bogdan.donciu@mt.ro</a></p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform Technical Assistance ("TA") on the Romania Aviation Surveillance Modernization ("Project").</p>
<p>The Project will enable the Romanian Air Traffic Services Administration (ROMATSA) (the "Grantee") to establish an airspace modeling and simulation capability that specifically assesses airspace system performance, analyzes and identifies airspace-related performance issues, and provides analytical capabilities to assess future changes or procedures to the airspace system prior to deployment. The TA will develop high-level operational and technical recommendations regarding automation, surveillance, data communications, traffic flow management, and performance based navigation.</p>
<p>ROMATSA is Romania's only air traffic operator and has oversight of air traffic management facilities throughout the country. The Romanian airspace plays a significant role in the European transportation network of the South-East Europe region, acting as a bridge between North, South, East and West Europe. While air traffic has been steadily increasing, forecasts predict further higher traffic demand driven by the economic growth in the region, by the emergence of new areas of cooperation and commitment within the European Union, as well as an increase in European tourism and business travelers.</p>
<p>As part of the Single European Sky (SES) aviation program, Romania joined in 2004 with Bulgaria to create a Functional Airspace Block (FAB) called the Danube FAB, which will be established latest on 04th December 2012, when the implementation of the DANUBE FAB Project will start. This FAB is one of nine such entities that comprise the SES community. Each FAB will retain local autonomy as identified in the new European Single Sky Implementation strategy, but must nonetheless remain in line with the EUROCONTROL Air Traffic Management (ATM) Master Plan, which is the European equivalent of the Federal Aviation Administration's NextGen program. As such, the Danube FAB must ensure that its surveillance, data communications, traffic flow management, and performance-based navigation systems conform to SES requirements.</p>
<p>Beyond the Danube FAB, ROMATSA's 2012 National Performance Plan identifies a number of measures, changes and goals to be achieved for the organization to increase efficiency and to expand its leading role in the market. This plan strongly focuses on increasing the number of operations served by controllers and decreasing costs at 16 airports where ROMATSA provides services. Additional pressure to reach these goals is exerted by the airlines, as they have expressed a concern regarding operation cost. Accordingly, ROMATSA is in the process of working with stakeholders to assess potential charge modifications in the near future. This TA will support the implementation of modern airspace technologies to meet SES requirements, its recent entrance in the Danube FAB, and its 2012 National Performance Plan.</p>
<p>Portions of a background Definitional Mission Romania: Aviation Projects is provided for reference in Annex 2.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $513,170 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Eng. Reem Hamdan<br />Assistant Director General for Regulation And Planning<br />Electricity Distribution Company<br />P.O. Box 830878<br />Amman 11183<br />Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan<br />Phone: +962 6 533 1330<br />Fax: +962 6 534 1213&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study (Study) for a smart grid upgrade to an electricity distribution company in Jordan.</p>
<p>This Study is intended to enable EDCO to improve operating efficiency, reduce losses, and cut costs through the use of smart grid technology. The Study is also designed to help EDCO modernize its electrical grid and incorporate advanced technology in order to deliver a more efficient and reliable electrical supply to its customers.</p>
<p>EDCO is one of three electricity networks in Jordan. The other two electricity distribution companies are also pursuing smart grid upgrades with support from USTDA. EDCO is a private company established in 1998, serving approximately 181,000 customers across 53,000 sq. km. EDCO was privatized in 2008 and is now wholly owned by Kingdom Electricity Company, a subsidiary of Dubai Capital.</p>
<p>Historically, residential and commercial customers represented over 95% of EDCO's clients but consumed only 39% of the electricity. Recently, EDCO has experienced extraordinary growth in residential electricity consumption due to increased use of home appliances and a nation-wide electrification effort. The proposed project would provide improvements to electricity distribution by installing a smart meter system, aiming at 100% smart meter penetration within three years. This would increase the reliability and efficiency of EDCO's network and give EDCO greater flexibility in setting consumption-specific tariffs.</p>
<p>The Study will assess the most appropriate technologies and design a smart metering implementation plan for the proposed project. Areas to be directly assessed would include identifying the resources necessary for the system-wide smart metering implementation, including cost implications, availability of funding, and direct and indirect benefits of smart meter installations. As part of the Study, a new tariff structure would be developed that would allow energy savings for consumers and yield benefits for EDCO in the areas of: billing, metering and collection efficiency gains, improved customer service, and reduced energy theft. All available technologies would be reviewed in the context of EDCO's coverage area within Jordan.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $454,500 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). The Grantee has agreed to a cash cost share of $50,500, or 10% of the total project cost. The Grantee Cost Share will be dispersed according to the Milestone Payment Schedule.</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<p><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>

Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) The solicitation SP0600-12-Q-0269 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Part 13.

<p>(v)/(vi) STATEMENT OF WORK for Thermal Stability Analyzer</p>
<p>Equipment Functional Requirement: Stand-alone system not only capable of achieving the Critical Operating Characteristics identified in ASTM International test procedure D 3241, Table 2, but more specifically, capable of automatically accomplishing a group of critical tasks. Two of these critical tasks which the instrument must accomplish in automated fashion are specified in ASTM International test procedure D 3241, paragraphs 11.4.3 (checking fuel flow rate) and 11.5.1 (recording filter pressure drop). A third critical task is automatic shutdown of the instrument when the test concludes under standard conditions. This task is referred to in D 3241, paragraph 11.7.2. Final critical task is safety related. The instrument must automatically cut off the flow of fuel in the event of a loss of system integrity. To state the requirement in alternate terms, if, for example an operator inadvertently strikes the tubing downstream of the test filter and dislodges it, the instrument must not continue to pump fuel onto the workbench and ultimately onto the floor. In combination, automation of these 4 critical tasks allows a single operator to start a thermal stability analysis using the instrument and then move on to conduct of other laboratory operations.</p>

<p><br />(vii) Delivery, Installation and Set-up Requirement: Single piece of automated test equipment capable of independently satisfying functional requirement above shall be delivered door to door to the DLA Energy Europe &amp; Africa laboratory located in Kaiserslautern, Germany. Vendor shall install and set up the equipment at customer site to verify correct operation.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372-3695.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Installation Description:</strong></span></p>
<p>Gillem Enclave is an approximately 237-acre site located in Forest Park, 10 miles southeast of Atlanta, Georgia. It is home to the 1st U.S. Army, the Army &amp; Air Force Exchange Service (Atlanta Distribution Center), 3D Military Police Group (CID) United States Army Criminal Investigation Command, 2nd Recruiting Brigade, 52nd Ordnance Group and the Equipment Concentration Site for the 81st Regional Support Command, and many other Army, Department of Defense and Government organizations. <br /><br />Named in honor of Lieutenant General Alvan Cullom Gillem, Jr., the Installation was established in 1941 with the relocation of the Candler Warehouse from the Atlanta General Depot to what is now Fort Gillem. The depot saw many name changes as it served as trainer and supplier throughout World War II, the Korean Conflict, the Berlin Airlift, the Cuban Crisis and the Vietnam War. Thousands of soldiers trained at the Installation and tons of equipment destined for war zones processed through the warehouse system. In 1973, the responsibility for the Installation was transferred from the Army Materiel Command to U.S. Army Forces Command and the Installation was renamed Fort Gillem and made a satellite installation of Fort McPherson. In 2005, the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) recommended the closure of Fort Gillem. Under this action, the Army disposed of roughly 1,189 acres of surplus property on 15 September 2011 and will retain and maintain an enclave of roughly 237 acres for continued military use of the existing site.</p>

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute anticipates posting a request for proposal (RFP) under NHLBI-HV-12-05, the NHLBI Gene Therapy Resource Program (GTRP) Clinical Coordinating Center - Renewal, on or about March 31, 2011. The objective of the RFP is to continue the activities of the GTRP Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) for five years. The purpose of the Program is to facilitate the translation of basic research in gene therapy to clinical application in the areas of heart, lung, and blood diseases. The GTRP provides resources in the areas of preclinical and clinical-grade vector production in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and in the conduct of pharmacology/toxicology studies. In addition, the GTRP provides funds and regulatory assistance to investigators wishing to conduct gene therapy clinical trials. The GTRP consists of a clinical coordinating center that oversees and coordinates the logistics of the core laboratories and provides regulatory assistance for clinical trials; a preclinical-grade vector production core laboratory; a clinical-grade vector production core laboratory for adeno-associated virus (AAV); a clinical-grade vector production core laboratory for lentivirus; and a pharmacology/toxicology core laboratory. The CCC will continue to 1) participate in the Steering Committee (SC), and subcommittees as necessary, and attend SC meetings and participate in teleconferences, 2) schedule and coordinate the logistics of meetings, teleconferences, site visits and other face-to-face meetings between groups associated with conduct of the study, 3) develop, in collaboration with the SC, forms to be used by the Core Laboratories and investigators, 4) establish, in collaboration with the SC, and maintain an electronic database for use in capturing information conveyed to and from groups associated with the study, 5) develop, maintain and update a secure and password-protected Internet web site with pages for each of the Core Laboratories, 6) ensure that each Core Laboratory continually possesses all required certifications, inspections, and assurances, 7) develop and maintain a Manual of Procedures (MOP), 8) receive and process investigators' requests for vector production, pharmacological and/or toxicological studies, and clinical trials support services, 9) handle travel-related expense reimbursements for study-associated group members to attend meetings and site visits, 10) ensure that investigators have obtained, when necessary, regulatory approvals (i.e., IRB, IBC, RAC, NIH OBA) and had contact with or obtained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, 11) act as the conduit for funding of clinical trials which have been approved by the NHLBI as part of the program, and 12) register all GTRP clinical trials on the ClinicalTrials.gov web site.
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP) and, although one award is anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. A five-year "Cost-Reimbursement-Completion" type contract with a "Multi-year" FAR 17.1 funding mechanism, is being considered for this requirement. The ultimate contract type and funding mechanism will be determined by the NHLBI, based on what best fits the GTRP program goals and the available funding. The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://fedbizopps.gov. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments. It is also offerors' responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any amendments to the RFP. Letters of intent to submit a proposal for the RFP are due no later than May 28, 2011. This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541711.&nbsp; NO ACTION REQUIRED FOR THIS NOTICE.</p>

<a href="mailto:john.butto@navy.mil">John N. Butto, PCO</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide the following information:  

The attached file, titled N0002412R5315_Draft_DD254, inadvertently included a Purchase Request that was inadvertently released on FedBizOps on 3 May 2012.  The file in its entirety, except for redacted names and phone numbers, is being re-released in order to ensure equal access to information.  The estimated dollar figure in this document is a very rough figure and does not accurately reflect the work that is included in the draft RFP.  This information was not intended for release and therefore, the Government does not recommend that it be used in proposal development.

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to post a solicitation for one Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Contract, Data Items and Provisioned Item Orders as well as options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), Non-Recurring Engineering Effort for AMDR-S and AMDR RSC Production, Field Engineering Services, Second Source Qualification, Data Rights, Engineering Services, and Long Lead Material for the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) S-band Radar and Radar Suite Controller (RSC).
 

NAVSEA intends to award one Cost Plus Incentive Fee base contract with Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target Options for LRIP and Non-Recurring Engineering Effort for AMDR-S and AMDR RSC Production, Firm Fixed Price Options for Second Source Qualification and Data Rights, Cost Only Option for Long Lead Material, Options for Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Engineering Services and Field Engineering Services with Cost Only Travel Support via full and open competition.
The solicitation will be issued electronically via http://www.neco.navy.mil.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided or mailed. Interested offerors should monitor both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerceon Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil for the release of the solicitation.
 Since this solicitation, and any applicable amendments, will be issued electronically, the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidder's mailing list. 

AMDR is envisioned as a radar suite designed to be scalable to accommodate current and future mission requirements for multiple platforms. AMDR will consist of an S-band radar (AMDR-S), an X-band radar and a Radar Suite Controller (RSC).  The AMDR-S will provide volume search, tracking, Ballistic Missile Defense(BMD) discrimination, and missile communications. The X-band radar will provide horizon search, surface search, and periscope detection. Both radars will be integrated into a suite by the RSC. The RSC will provide the appropriate interfaces between the AMDR-S, X-band radar, and combat system.
  The RSC will perform coordinating actions to ensure that both radars operate in concert in a widely diverse environment. This solicitation will address the AMDR-S/RSC EMD phase and LRIP.

IMPORTANT: In order to be considered for contract award, each company must have a TOP SECRET facility clearance by time of award, however, all offerors must be able to receive classified portions of the solicitation up to the SECRET level and must be a United States (US) company or an independent US subsidiary.  However, foreign contractors may act as subcontractors to U.S. prime contractors. The export of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data is subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and requires the issuance of an export license by the U.S.
 Department of State. 

There will be classified attachments at the SECRET/US Only level to the solicitation. These classified documents will be supplied on a CD/DVD which will be mailed separately. Only one copy of the classified CD/DVD will be distributed per pre-solicitation notice respondent. To obtain these classified attachments, interested offerors must completely fill out the "RFP Classified Material Request Form" which is attached to this pre-solicitation notice.
This information should be submitted to Brian Wessmiller via e-mail at brian.wessmiller@navy.mil with a copy to john.butto@navy.mil and erica.l.bowling@navy.mil. Once approved, the Government will be able to mail a classified CD/DVD to the respondent if a solicitation is issued.
 

Draft portions of the solicitation are attached to this pre-solicitation notice for industry questions and comments. The government will be accepting comments through 20 April 2012. Unclassified questions and comments should be electronically submitted to John N. Butto (john.butto@navy.mil) and Erica Bowling (erica.l.bowling@navy.mil). Questions may be answered and incorporated into the final Request for Proposal at the discretion of the Navy.
There are two classified attachments at the SECRET/US Only level to the draft solicitation. Please see Section L of the draft solicitation for conditions and instructions regarding access to classified attachments. All potential offerors seeking access to the classified attachments to the Draft RFP must completely fill out the "Draft RFP Classified Material Request Form as soon as possible as well as furnish the following signed certification:

I, [insert signatory's name, title, company], hereby certify that [company] will destroy any and all copies, notes, or other materials produced using the classified or other restricted information provided inconnection with draft solicitation N00024-12-R-5315 within 180 days from receipt of access to the information, unless [company] submits a proposal in response to a final solicitation N00024-12-R-5315 issued by the Naval SeaSystems Command.

The Draft RFP Classified Material Request Form and above signed certification should be submitted to Brian Wessmiller via e-mail at brian.wessmiller@navy.mil with a copy to john.butto@navy.mil and erica.l.bowling@navy.mil.
Once approved, the Government will be able to mail a classified CD/DVD to the respondent.

This pre-solicitation notice is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.
  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO isunavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. Disclaimer: This pre-solicitation notice is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts.
The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as aresult of this synopsis. If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FEDBIZOPPS/NECO and interested parties must comply with that announcement.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a solicitation for a project to support the development of the Level 2 PRA logic model and the T-H aspects of the full-scope site Level 3 PRA project</p>
<p>A full-scope site Level 3 probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for a nuclear power plant site can provide valuable insights into the relative importance of various risk contributors by assessing accidents involving the reactor core as well as other site radiological sources (i.e., spent fuel pools, dry storage casks, and multiple units). These insights can be used to further enhance regulatory decision making and to help focus limited agency resources on issues most directly related to the agency's mission to protect public health and safety.</p>
<p>Although Level 3 PRAs have since been performed to some extent within both the United States and international nuclear industries, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has not sponsored development of a Level 3 PRA for a nuclear power plant site since NUREG-1150. In the more than two decades that have passed since the NUREG-1150 Level 3 PRAs were performed, numerous technical advances have been made that were not reflected in the NUREG-1150 PRA models. The staff has also identified additional scope considerations not previously considered that could be addressed by performing a new full-scope site Level 3 PRA.</p>
<p>A Level 2 PRA model provides 1) a structured and comprehensive evaluation of containment performance in response to accident sequences identified from the Level 1 analysis and 2) a quantitative characterization of radiological release to the environment that would result from accident sequences that involve leakage from the containment pressure boundary. Deterministic T-H modeling and analyses serve as the basis for many of the assumptions used in the Level 2 as well as the Level 1 PRA logic models. As such, the T-H models and analyses must adequately represent those systems and phenomena that are being modeled so that the PRA logic model represents realistic plant response to various accident scenarios.</p>
<p>This will be a competitive acquisition for the award of a cost reimbursement type contract. This procurement is set-aside 100% for Small Business concerns. All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers. The designated NAICS Code is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, with a size standard of $17 Million. The government anticipates a contract period of performance of September 01, 2012 to August 31, 2016.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued as a request for proposal (RFP) utilizing FAR Part 15, tradeoff process. The government anticipates release of the solicitation on or about May 22, 2012, with a projected closing date of June 26, 2012. These are projected dates and are subject to change. This solicitation and all amendments will be issued to Federal Business Opportunities Website (FedBizOpps) at http://www.fbo.gov/. All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website.
