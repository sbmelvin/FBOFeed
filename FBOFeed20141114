<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction.

<p>The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. <br />TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: unrestricted</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>

Design will include space planning and workflows using EBD and Patient Centered Care healing environment principles that support patient outcomes. 

C.	As Evidence Based Design is an important component of this project, the VA will examine several evidence based design concepts which will be implemented in the project, to measure the significance of selected design elements in an Inpatient Mental Health unit. The VA will conduct this collaborative research study.

D.	This project will eliminate semi-private consult rooms and create private consult rooms to meet the patient privacy goals as defined  in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

E.	A/E shall clearly identify the nature of service and the population served.  Then incorporate necessary components to meet the specific needs of the unique Mental Health population being served. 

F.	Areas, adjacent to the unit, will receive minor upgrades and new finishes for continuity throughout the floor and to improve the overall environment of care.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis (LHC), plans to procure on a sole source basis 25 plates of the 30 Plex V plex inflammatory panel from MesoScale Discovery 1601 Research Blvd, Rockville, MD 20850. <br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 325414 and the employees size standard is 500.<br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract. <br /><br />Delivery of supplies shall be made no later than thirty (30) days after contract award. <br /><br />It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. <br /><br />The primary hypotheses of Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis' (LHC) study on circulating plasma cytokines are: a) circumvent over-diagnosis and potentially contribute to an low-dose CT (LDCT) diagnostic algorithm by better differentiating between benign and malignant nodules; and b) predict the outcome of patients diagnosed with a lung cancer using LDCT. Screening with LDCT will by its nature lead to the detection of more stage I cancers. The latter is a group of patients where there is a particular need for good biomarkers of outcome, as although surgery alone is the standard of care, up to 30% of these patients will experience a recurrence. By annotating which patients will have a poor prognosis, biomarkers that can predict outcome in patients with LDCT-detected cancers will also be advantageous to screening programs and could potentially aid in the selection of downstream therapeutic protocols. LHC has previously shown that circulating cytokines are predictive of lung cancer risk up to 5 years before a diagnosis in European Americans, but LHC has yet to test this hypothesis in African Americans. The literature suggests that this is necessary to do as cytokine profiles, even among controls, are significantly different from European Americans. As cytokines are secreted directly from tumor cells, these data suggest that cytokines will be useful as tools to avoid over-diagnosis of lung cancer detected by LDCT and guiding therapy choices for patients with lung cancer. <br /><br /><strong>Contractor Technical requirements:</strong> <br /><br />The contractor shall provide: <br /><br />1) 25 plates of the Human Cytokine 30-Plex V-Plex inflammatory panel <br />2) 25 Plates for Human CRP Kit <br />3) Shipping <strong>must</strong> be included on total pricing<br /><br /><br />In the past, the Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis (LHC) has conducted studies using this same technology on European Americans and a pilot study of African Americans. If LHC select a different vendor for this study, program will not be able to compare the findings from both studies and this would thus lead to both a missed opportunity for value added research, and the inability to perform one of LHC's objectives, which is to compare signals from European Americans and African Americans. Therefore, using a vendor other than Mesoscale Discovery will be most costly to the Government. <br /><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote for the Government to consider. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 11 AM EST, on November 28, 2014. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed to 240-276-5399 or emailed to Reyes Rodriguez, Contracting Specialist via electronic mail at reyes.rodriguez@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) through sam.gov.

<p><br />Statement of Work (SOW)</p>
<p>National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</p>
<p>1. Title: NIH Sign Language Interpreting Services and Computer Aided Real Time Transcribing Services Performance Based Contract.</p>
<p>2. Background: As the world's premier biomedical research institution, the NIH is committed to meeting the needs of staff, patients, guests and visitors who are Deaf/Hard of Hearing (D/HH). The NIH uses interpreting services and Computer Aided Real Time Transcribing Services (CART) to facilitate communication for events/meetings such as work-related meetings, training sessions, safety talks, discussions on work related procedures, policies and assignments, human resources actions, conferences and any events attended by (D/HH) persons, as well patient visits and appointments. In 2008, NIH used over 21,000 hours of interpreting and CART services. Over the last five years, NIH has used an average of over 19,000 hours annually. Historically, interpreting services have increased 5 to 7 percent a year. The services are primarily performed at on- and off-campus locations. In addition to the main NIH Bethesda Campus, services may be required to be performed at other NIH locations throughout the United States. The contractor is to provide qualified interpreters and CART services to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>The need for a qualified interpreting services and CART contractor exists because of the continual growth, professional development, and daily work routine of the D/HH employees, NIH guests and patients. There are also a number of "open to the public" events regularly scheduled. The NIH currently provides interpreting and CART services through a centrally-funded and managed performance based contract.</p>
<p>The NIH has established under the Office of the Director (OD), Office of Research Services (ORS), Division of Amenities and Transportation Services (DATS) a Program Management Team to oversee these requirements and services provided to our customers through this contract. This team consists of the Program Manager, a Federal Government employee in the DATS who is responsible for oversight and management of the contract. In addition, DATS has one full-time and one part-time Quality Assurance Specialist to assist in handling the day to day operations and surveillance of the contract as well as resolve any issues that may arise.</p>
<p>3. Project Objectives: The DATS Program Management Team will maintain primary responsibility and oversight of the contract. This SOW is for functional and technical assistance in this effort. This one year Performance Based Service Contract with four (4) option years will be to provide interpreting and CART services to the NIH. NIH is requesting qualified offeror's to respond to the tasks described in this SOW.</p>
<p>4. Scope: The NIH employs approximately 30,000 persons of which an estimated 100 are self-identified as D/HH employees, but also numerous events that are open to the public, scientific and research symposiums, patients, patient visitors, contractors, etc. who are located primarily on the NIH Bethesda Campus but at our leased facilities throughout Montgomery County, MD as well. There is an expectation that this number of D/HH employees will grow by 1 to 2 % each year. NIH employees are also located in Frederick, Baltimore, North Carolina, and Montana and in other parts of the United States where there is/may be a need to provide interpreting and CART services to employees and guests. On an individual or case by case basis, the NIH will make prior arrangements with the contractor to reimburse for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the interpreter (i.e., mileage, parking, tolls, lodging) in accordance with U.S. Government/NIH travel regulations if the interpreting or CART request is not in an NIH recognized duty station. Interpreting services are used principally for meetings, which can include supervisory-employee meetings, training classes, etc. Interpreting and CART services are also needed for patient consultations, lectures and special events, which include, but are not limited to, a large gathering of persons which may include D/HH persons (i.e., symposiums, conferences, lectures etc.) In addition, any activities sponsored by NIH involving government employees, patients, guests, and visitors in accordance with the guidance found in the NIH Manual Issuance - 2204 Reasonable Accommodations http://www1.od.nih.gov/oma/manualchapters/management/2204/2204.pdf Section J: Sign Language Interpreting Services may also require interpreting and CART services.</p>

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE:

*This Presolicitation Notice is being issued for informational purposes only.  
*No responses are required at this time.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Research Facilities (ORF), plans to enter into a contract with a qualified contractor capable of performing heavy electrical/structural construction services necessary in replacing four 13,800 volt transformers and associated switchgear on the 14th floor of the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF) tower in electrical Vault 11. 

This project is a major construction/facilities capital investment.  Work will be performed in Building 10s ACRF Tower, located on the NIH Main Campus, Bethesda, Maryland.

CONTRACT INFORMATION: 

The contract will be a firm-fixed price, single-award contract.  Total potential contract performance period shall be 780 calendar days from Notice to Proceed.  The contract value is $7.8M.  The project will be advertised in FedBizOpps under a Full and Open competition acquisition process resulting in a Best Value award.

PROJECT INFORMATION:

The NIH is seeking to obtain the services of a highly qualified credentialed contractor with the capability and experience to perform complex electrical infrastructure work involving heavy structural erection over energized 13,800 volt transformers and associated feeders, within an occupied Healthcare or Research facility. The work and associated deliverables to be performed under the contract include, but are not limited to:

Procurement, fabrication, field assembly, installation, testing and commissioning of three (replacement) 2000 KVA, 13.8 KV-480 volt spot network normal power dry type transformers, one (upgraded from 500KVA) 1500 KVA, 13.8 KV-480 emergency power dry type transformer, 480 volt switchgear, interconnecting 480 Volt bus ducts, incoming 15 KV cables from ACRF Vault 10, necessary cable terminations, three 15 KV Fused Load Break Disconnect Switches for normal power feeders 60, 70, 80 and one 15 KV Fused Load break Disconnect Switch for emergency power feeder 85L1(old W10). In addition to transformers and switchgear Vault 11 will be cooled by three (3) new 12-ton vertical floor mounted air conditioning units.

The 13,800 volt feeders #60, #70 & #80 emanating from Vault 10 serve the three existing spot network transformers while Feeder #W10, also emanating from Vault 10, serves the existing 500 KVA emergency transformer. These existing feeders, bus-ways between each transformer, overhead conduit for the switchgear and the switchgear itself will be replaced by this project and are all below the line of the proposed new mezzanine platform that will house the new transformers.

The upgraded emergency power transformer will provide the future capability of adding additional equipment such as the Air Handling Units that supply air to the ambulatory clinics and research laboratories in the ACRF. Additionally the project requires the removal of life safety equipment power for the Clinical Research Center (CRC) to be re-fed from the CRC Vault AB.  This change will mitigate any interruption or disruption that might occur with shutdowns during construction in the vault that could impact the hospital (CRC).

Included in the project will be redundant power sources for: 1) the radio communications supporting NIH fire and police; 2) re-circuiting of stairwells #15 and #16 lighting and pressurization fans in the stairwells; and 3) moving the redundant emergency power source for Pharmacy exhaust fans on ACRF roof to Vault-10. 

The first phase of the work will involve the removal of some minor distribution feeders that are in the way of the new transformer platform and the removal of the failed out of service network transformer #80.

After installation of the structural work for the mezzanine platform which encompasses the entire footprint of Vault 11, the sequential removal of each transformer will be accomplished and new dry type transformers assembled, installed, and energized on the new mezzanine platform. Along with each transformer each new section of the electrical switchgear will be installed and connected to the new transformer and distribution feeders to allow uninterrupted power service to the building. Once complete, the old switchgear will be disconnected and removed.

A carefully orchestrated, phased transition shall be required for two distinct equipment block movements; the transition from liquid to dry-type transformers making way for the new switchgear, and the subsequent transition from the existing switchgear to the new. The replacement project must be phased such that two transformers remain in service at all times.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:

Prior to commencing with the selection criteria evaluation, each offeror will be evaluated for compliance with the following minimum qualifications/requirements:

Mandatory Qualification Criteria 1: Bonding
Mandatory Qualification Criteria 2: Safety Program Pre-Qualification
Mandatory Qualification Criteria 3: Ability to Perform Asbestos/Hazardous Material Removal
Mandatory Qualification Criteria 4: Joint Ventures (If Applicable)

SELECTION CRITERIA:

For those Offerors meeting the minimum requirements, the Offeror shall receive a technical evaluation based on the following criteria:

FACTOR A: Offeror's Past Performance
FACTOR B: Offeror's Corporate Experience
FACTOR C: Experience of Key Personnel
FACTOR D: Offeror's Management Plan

FACTOR A will be evaluated for performance risk and adjectively rated; FACTOR B through FACTOR D will be adjectively rated. FACTOR B is most important; FACTORs C and D are equally important and individually less important than FACTOR B.

Although technical qualification factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, cost/price is also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. The Government will award the responsible Offeror whose proposal in the Governments estimation provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.

Cost/Price Significance.  A trade-off process between the technical merits and the proposed price will be considered for meeting the requirements and obtaining the most economical price to the Government.  Price will be a factor in the award decision but will be less important than technical.  Technical will be significantly more important than price.

Past Performance.  Past performance for risk is an evaluation element.

Small Business Subcontracting and Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Participation Plans.  The Offerors approach in meeting/exceeding the DHHS goals for Small Business Subcontracting and Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plans will be required. The price review will score the Offerors stated Small Business Subcontracting goals verses the contract minimums. Additionally, the Offerors actual participation in achieving previously stated participation goals will be evaluated. The Plans will also be reviewed by the NIH Small Business Office and the HHS PCR.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:

This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 36.  Submission requirements will be detailed in the formal solicitation advertised in FedBizOpps.

Note: One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.

<DESC>This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, but merely notification of the Social Security Administration's (SSA) intent to issue, on a sole-source basis, a firm fixed-price delivery order to LRP Publications, Inc., against their Library of Congress FEDLINK contract for access to their on-line subscription to CyberFEDS on the Web Complete Library and Workers' Compensation on CyberFEDS. This is a renewal.
<p><br />This resource is used extensively in the Office of General Counsel, the Office of Labor-Management and Employee Relations, and the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review to manage SSA employment disputes. The CyberFEDS database includes specialized treatises related to MSPB and FLRA law, an extensive database of labor arbitration decisions, quick start guides on a number of legal topics, and checklists and reference materials. Under Federal Acquisition Procedures (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Sources Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, the on-line subscription to CyberFEDS on the Web Complete Library and Workers' Compensation on CyberFEDS is only available from LRP Publications, Inc.

<p>Personnel in the Office of General Counsel, Office of Labor-Management and Employee Relations, and Office of Disability Adjudication and Review use the CyberFEDS database to research and evaluate the employment-related claims of Agency personnel. The arbitration decisions, legal analysis, and procedural guidance found in the CyberFEDS database are critical in allowing SSA employees in these components to effectively represent the Agency in administrative and court-level hearings. <br /><br />LRP's CyberFEDS database provides the following content and features that make it uniquely qualified to meet the legal needs of our personnel:</p>
<p>&bull; The most extensive database of labor arbitration decisions of any publisher, including EEOC, FLRA, ADA, Classification Appeals, and Workers' Comp.<br />&bull; MSPB ALJ decisions (from 1994 to the present) and FLRA ALJ decisions (from 1981 to the present).<br />&bull; The Broida Guide to MSPB Law and Practice, the Broida Guide to FLRA Law and Practice, and the Broida Arbitration Guide. These treatises from one of the foremost experts in federal employment law are an invaluable resource in settling employment disputes. <br />&bull; Hadley's Guide to Federal Sector Equal Employment Law and Practice.<br />&bull; Customized search templates that allow the user to search by citation, arbitrator, union, or case name.<br />&bull; Quick Start Guides - More than 400 guides covering all areas of federal employment law, including age, sex, and race discrimination, disability law, equal pay requirements, and prohibited personnel practices.<br />&bull; A database of Arbitrators' biographies and statistics, which provides over 4,000 entries for arbitrators who have worked with the federal government, and includes statistics on their decisions regarding labor/management holdings.<br />&bull; Employment and Labor Statutes and Regulations arranged by topic<br />&bull; Checklists Plus+ includes additional information in an easy to use format on federal employment issues.</p>

Information received will normally be considered for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this publication.

<CONTACT>Sara J. Marrie, Phone 3014437599, Email sara.marrie@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS), on behalf of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) intends to sole source to:
<p>Health Research &amp; Educational Trust - Health Services Research (HRET/HSR)<br />155 North Wacker, 4th Floor <br />Chicago, IL 60606</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c), AHRQ's requirement is described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) National Stock Number (NSN): N/A</p>
<p>(2) Specification:</p>
<p>AHRQ is seeking a journal supplement on patient safety and medical liability: demonstration grants for a period not to exceed 10 months. AHRQ's objective is to review, edit, and manage all aspects of editorial production for a special supplement of Health Services Research (HSR). HSR shall prepare a series of papers from demonstration grants that were funded under AHRQ's Patient Safety and Medical Liability Initiative. This supplement will focus on the outcomes and progress of the demonstration grantees, and will include commentaries and guest authors.</p>
<p>(3) Manufacturer: Health Research &amp; Educational Trust</p>
<p>(4) Functional Description:</p>
<p>HSR is the primary publication outlet for AcademyHealth, the professional association for health services research professionals. AHRQ is proposing to acquire a journal supplement with HSR. The purpose of this special supplement is to document and describe the key aspects of this groundbreaking federal initiative and the evaluation of that effort. It is critical that the outcomes of this report be communicated to potential users in the healthcare field through the professional journal as a relevant communication channel by using a journal that has a balanced perspective, relevant audience, and an established peer-review process with access to experienced experts.</p>
<p>(5) Predominant material of manufacture: N/A<br />(6) Quantity: electronically and/or printed resource - page limitation TBD for manuscripts<br />(7) Unit of issue: page limitation TBD for manuscripts<br />(8) Destination information:</p>
<p>AHRQ<br />540 Gaither Road<br />Rockville, MD 20850</p>
<p>(9) Delivery Schedule: N/A</p>
<p>10) Duration of the contract period: Period of performance shall not exceed 10 months from date of award.</p>
<p>11) Sustainable acquisition requirements: N/A</p>
<p>12) Description of Procedure: This is a presolicitation notice of intent to sole source. This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. The anticipated award date is no later than January 6, 2015.</p>
<p>13) Architect-Engineer Project: N/A</p>
<p>14) Trade Agreement Clauses: N/A</p>
<p>15) Sole Source Justification: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS), on behalf of the Agency for Healthcare Research &amp; Quality (AHRQ), intends to sole source to:</p>
<p>Health Research &amp; Educational Trust - Health Services Research (HRET/HSR)<br />155 North Wacker, 4th Floor <br />Chicago, IL 60606</p>
<p>HSR is the primary publication outlet for AcademyHealth, the professional association for health services research professionals. AHRQ is proposing to acquire a journal supplement with HSR for many reasons which include the broad and relevant audience for this journal, and the quality of this publication's peer-review process. A special supplement with HSR offers the unprecedented opportunity to advance research findings from AHRQ's patient safety and medical liability demonstration grant program to the health services research community. This audience will be able to take these learnings and foster additional improvements in safety and the quality of health care delivery within the health services research field. Currently, research in this area has not been widely evident in the peer-reviewed literature and the rigor of HSR's review process will support the publication of strong papers and in turn, will further AHRQ's program activities and the field.</p>
<p>HSR is also ranked among the top journals in the Institute for Scientific Information/ Thomson Scientific's "Health Care Sciences and Services" category of the Science Index, and in the "Health Policy and Services" category of the Social Sciences Index.</p>
<p>Without a special supplement from HSR, the research findings of these grants are less likely to be prepared in a cohesive and impactful manner that enables AHRQ to provide the most comprehensive vehicle to disseminate research findings and advance federal program activities for public use.</p>
<p>Because of its past accomplishments, experienced peer-review process for special supplements and access to the health care community, HSR is uniquely qualified to be a sole source contractor for the publication of a Special Supplement. Having identified such a source already, the contractor has an established process for producing a peer-reviewed journal supplement that would provide value to the Government and support AHRQ's research and program aims.</p>
<p>16) This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement. The email subject line must reference AHR144815 Supplement on Patient Safety and Medical Liability: Demonstration Grants. All responses are due by December 1, 2014, 12:00 PM Eastern Time and can be sent to Sara Marrie at Sara.Marrie@psc.hhs.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract base upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be issuing an Invitation for Bid for Repairs to the Jetties in Newburyport Harbor at Salisbury and Newburyport, MA.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The estimated construction cost is between $8,000,000 and $12,000,000.   <br>  <br> The proposed work consists of repairing the 3100-foot-long North Jetty in Salisbury and completing repairs to the remaining (most seaward) 140 feet of the 1,500-foot-long South Jetty in Newburyport that were damaged during Hurricane Sandy.  Approximately 30,000 tons of armor stone will be required - including approximately 5,000 tons of 14- to 19-ton armor stone.  Crest width varies from 5 to 15 feet.  Crest elevation at the most seaward end is +12.3 feet mean lower low water (mllw), and +17.3 mllw at the landward end.  Side slopes are 1 vertical:1 horizontal on the river side and 2 horizontal:1 vertical on the ocean side.  The work includes replacing displaced core and armor stone to fill in existing gaps in the jetty.  Repairs will require substantial moving and rehandling of existing stones to obtain the required interlocking placement.  Work also includes repair of a 190-foot-long stone spur off the North Jetty, approximately 600 feet seaward from the beginning of the jetty, and removal of two Navigation Aids (metal towers and concrete bases) from the North Jetty, and installation of new concrete bases.  About 6 days per month during the construction window seas can be expected to be in excess of 8 feet in the river mouth. Stone deliveries to the jetties shall be done by water for the seaward half of the North Jetty and for the entire 140-foot portion of the South Jetty.  Equipment and stone delivery and access to the jetty may be performed from land, water, or a combination for the landward half of the North Jetty.  It is expected that there will be no seasonal constraints on the work.  The expected storage/staging area for the stone, equipment, and trailer is on MA Department of Conservation & Recreation (DCR) property in Salisbury.  Any DCR property, including the parking lot, dunes, and any excess vegetation damaged will be restored to their pre-construction condition.   <br>  <br> This is not a request for proposals at this time. The solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about December 15, 2014. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted.

<DESC>This synopsis is for the Medical Appointment Scheduling System (MASS) solution for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) Product Development (PD).  The MASS solution will replace the current inpatient and outpatient scheduling system(s) to provide more efficient access to care for Veterans.  Medical scheduling is complex in that it requires coordination across medical services while enforcing business rules.  Veterans Health Information Systems and Technical Architecture (VistA) Scheduling was built in the early 1980's as an inpatient care scheduling system with few embedded business rules.  Today's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care delivery is dramatically different from the past with the majority of appointments scheduled for outpatient care.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 approximately 8.9 million of the 21.9 million living Veterans in the nation were enrolled in the VA health care system.  VHA's 50,000 users scheduled over 100 million appointments in FY2014 for this Veteran population.  Serving this volume requires state of the art capacity management tools and a solution that provides for efficient scheduling to meet Veteran demand.

The current VHA Medical Scheduling system is outdated and outmoded.  VHA's current scheduling processes do not meet the needs of patients, providers or the VHA scheduling staff.  Modernization of the system across the enterprise is required in order to meet patient scheduling needs of today's VHA.  In the current state, clinic grids are inflexible, productivity is not measurable, there is no method for scheduling resources (staff, rooms, equipment), and there are no links between scheduled appointments and ancillary appointments, i.e. lab and radiology.  These broken links cause unnecessary bookings and re-bookings as well as increased travel costs and patient dissatisfaction with VHA scheduling practices.

VA is seeking a solution that focuses on an aggressive schedule to get core capabilities delivered to all VA medical facilities.  Core capabilities will be implemented nationwide in the first two years of the contract.  All remaining capabilities will be implemented nationally throughout the contract period of performance in a series of incremental enhancements.

Core capabilities consist of developing, configuring and implementing a resource-centric outpatient medical appointment scheduling solution.  They include but are not limited to:

"	Configuring standard national operating parameters that can be tailored to meet local needs.
"	Managing requests for care. Storing the date of the request and preferred date for the appointment for subsequent reporting.
"	Managing appointments with the ability to execute, monitor and report on appointment, cancellation, reschedule and notification processes.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is seeking capabilities information from vendors to support and develop the USDA National Organic Program's (NOP) Organic Integrity Database (OID). <br />Background <br />The mission of the USDA/AMS National Organic Program (NOP) is to protect the integrity of the USDA organic seal, both domestically and abroad, and ensure that both producers and consumers trust the organic label. The NOP does this through marketing and regulatory activities related to organic agriculture, including administering the USDA organic regulations; accrediting and overseeing USDA-accredited certifying agents (called "certifiers") and State Organic Programs; and administering an organic compliance and enforcement program. <br />NOP currently maintains a list of certified USDA organic operations on its website that is updated on an annual basis at http://apps.ams.usda.gov/nop/. NOP also posts updates to this list if an operator becomes suspended or revoked during the year. The annual list of certified operations soon becomes out-of-date since new operations become certified throughout the year, and others surrender their certification. <br />Description of Need<br />NOP seeks to develop a new, interactive, web-based database of certified organic operations containing reliable, high quality information of value to the organic industry and public. A modernized certified organic operations management system will serve as a significant operational centerpiece for the NOP staff and stakeholders. When complete, NOP's Organic Integrity Database will help the program increase supply chain transparency, promote market visibility for organic operations, reduce certifier reporting burden, and deter fraud. <br />The Organic Integrity Database project scope includes the following:<br />&bull; Contain all elements in the current NOP list of certified organic operations at http://apps.ams.usda.gov/nop/ for all certified organic operations covered by NOP 4009 (National Organic Program Handbook: Guidance and Instructions for Accredited Certifying Agents and Certified Operations);<br />&bull; Ability to track organic operations and changes in certification information and status over time;<br />&bull; Provide structured fields for products/commodities while allowing for flexibility for unique entries;<br />&bull; Allow NOP's accredited certifying agents (certifiers) to update data and provide updates about their certified operators in multiple ways (i.e., manually, in batch uploads, or APIs/web services);<br />&bull; Provide permissions management to allow NOP staff, certifiers, and the public to appropriately see and/or edit data;<br />&bull; Ability to map an operation's location(s); <br />&bull; Include a Reporting module (e.g., operation counts, distribution);<br />&bull; Include a Certificate generation module.<br />Additionally, the database/system must comply with Section 508 of the Disability Act of 1978 and applicable Federal security and privacy policy and guidelines. <br />NOP is proposing to leverage current AMS platform technologies to build a cost-effective, yet modern system. The Appendix describes USDA's Technical Environment and the current Application Development Platforms. Additional background information on the National Organic Program can be found on NOP's website at: http://go.usa.gov/7dcx. Documents relevant to the OID project include:<br />&bull; Modernized Certified Organic Operations Database: Needs Assessment and Business Requirements Analysis (2013) http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5103061<br />&bull; Organic Integrity Database: An Overview (2014) http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5109718<br />Vendors interested in supporting AMS/NOP in the development of the Organic Integrity Database should have the capability to:
<p>&bull; Develop systems utilizing Agile processes such as Scrum/XP (e.g. ability to respond to changing requirements in a fast-paced environment with frequent business owner interactions); <br />&bull; Demonstrate experience with Microsoft CRM or .NET development environment;<br />&bull; Design systems to minimize operations and maintenance expenses where feasible, given the limited one-time nature of funding for system development.<br />&bull; Support early engagement with the certifier user community, as they will be key data providers for, and users of, the system. Organic Program domain and process expertise is desirable;</p>
<p><br />Request for Information Instructions <br />Responses to this publication will not result in a contract and will only be used for market research data. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) for competitive proposals. The Government will NOT award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide.<br />Interested sources may notify AMS of their interest in performing this type of work.

<DESC><p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> AFLCMC/WIN manages the USAF Imaging &amp; Targeting Support (I&amp;TS) portfolio supporting the Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Capabilities Working Group (GCWG). The GCWG manages and plans Air Force airborne GEOINT Capabilities Research, Development Test and Evaluation investments. The I&amp;TS portfolio is a key resource of the GCWG. The I&amp;TS portfolio identifies and provides limited funding to develop and demonstrate promising next-generation Air Force airborne GEOINT capabilities. The key focus of I&amp;TS is on the airborne sensor phenomenologies which include Electro/Optical, Infrared, Spectral-Multispectral/Hyperspectral Imaging, Ground Surveillance Radar, Full Motion Video, Light Detection and Ranging, and on-board processing/exploitation of sensor data.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> In support of the I&amp;TS program, AFLCMC/WIN is conducting market research across industry, academia and government agency programs. The intent is to identify promising candidate programs/technology efforts with projected capabilities that may improve current and future Air Force airborne GEOINT sensors and their role in enhancing the front side of end-to-end-functionality as well as identifying potential transition paths. Market research will help identify what research has been accomplished in the field of GEOINT, as well as technologies that currently exist or could be modified to fill a need. Although FY16 funding is uncertain, I&amp;TS managers are seeking <br />1 - 2 year projects beginning in FY16 that require funding of less than $3 million per year with Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4 or 5. AFLCMC/WIN seeks white papers and quad charts by 9 January 2015. All correspondence submitted will be protected and controlled as proprietary. After reviewing the submitted white papers and quad charts, the Government may request technical exchanges and/or site surveys of respondents' facilities. This market research will potentially shape Air Force efforts in the FY16-24 timeframe. The Government anticipates the information received will be used to plan and program the required efforts to support airborne GEOINT objectives. I&amp;TS candidates will be presented to the GCWG in the spring of 2015 for consideration.</p>

They are used by all military services.  The star clusters consist of five-star illuminant assemblies and a rocket motor propulsion assembly contained in a hand-held aluminum launching tube.  The base of the launching tube contains a primer and an initiating charge.  As shipped, the firing pin cap is assembled to the forward end and must be reversed for firing.  Stabilizing fins on the tail assembly of rockets are folded parallel to the axis of the signal.  A bolt, which also transfers the initiating charge flash to the propellant, extends into the center of the solid propellant which fills the propulsion assembly.  The illuminant assembly is mounted on top of the propulsion assembly with a delay assembly and an expelling charge between.  A label specifying firing procedures is secured to the body of the signal.  The parachute signals consist of a parachute-suspended illuminant assembly and a rocket motor propulsion assembly contained in a hand-held aluminum launching tube.  The base of the launching tube contains a primer and an initiating charge.  As shipped, the firing pin cap is assembled to the forward end and must be reversed for firing.  Stabilizing fins on the tail assembly of rockets are folded parallel to the axis of the signal.  A bolt, which also transfers the initiating charge flash to the propellant, extends into the center of the solid propellant, which fills the propulsion assembly.  The parachute/illuminant assembly is mounted on top of the propulsion assembly with a delay assembly and an expelling charge between them.  The parachute with suspension chords is packed on top of the illuminant, and the tube end is sealed with a cork disk (rocket barrel seal).  A label specifying firing procedures is secured to the body of the signal.  The propelling charge for both cluster and parachute type signals is Black Powder Propellant.  Black powder is used for the initiating and expelling charge for both cluster and parachute signals.  The No. 209 percussion primer is used in both cluster and parachute signals. <br>  <br> Critical components include magnesium powder, black powder, black powder propellant, the No. 209 percussion primer, and the stabilizing fin assembly.  Critical skills include the ability to handle/store hygroscopic materials, handle/formulate/press pyrotechnic mixtures, and fabrication of metal parts. <br>  <br> For different stages of the manufacturing process, special inspection and test equipment is required to ensure that the final product complies with USG requirements. The Contractor will be required to successfully conduct First Article Acceptance and Lot Acceptance tests on the items listed above. The Family of HHS is procured to an USG Technical Data Package (TDP). The entire TDP will not be provided in support of this market research; however top-level and packaging drawings identified above are available for interested sources to review. The drawings are Distribution Statement D, which means distribution is authorized to the Department of Defense and U.S. DOD Contractors only. Interested contractors that would like to obtain the top-level and packaging drawings must submit a written request to the POC identified below.

<DESC>The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) has entered into an Inter-Agency Agreement with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (hereafter referred to as BEP, a Division of The United States' Department of the Treasury) to distribute currency readers that are capable of determining the denomination of a U.S. Federal banknote. These currency readers are manufactured by Orbit Research, and are called iBill Currency Readers. <br /><br />NLS requires the acquisition of services for the development, implementation, deployment, and the on-going operations of a new Information Management System, the Currency Reader Information Management System (CRIMS). CRIMS shall support the management of patrons and devices associated with the Currency Reader Project. <br /><br />CRIMS shall interface/interact with the Patron Information Machine Maintenance System (PIMMS) to communicate patron information and related records to the system. PIMMS is the replacement system for the NLS Comprehensive Mailing List System (CMLS). In compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), only NLS-appointed staff shall have direct access to the PIMMS systems. The overall system is expected to be FISMA compliant at the "moderate" level. The contractor shall also perform due diligence needed to comply with federal IT security regulations.<br />

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; there is no solicitation available at this time. No response will be provided to requests for solicitation. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.<br />The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking capabilities statements related to the following:
<p>DTRA's EM-1 is the authoritative source on nuclear weapons phenomenology and effects and is the principal nuclear effects asset used by US Government agencies. EM-1 integrates significant updates, including recommendations and insights from post 9-11 and the evolution of technology, ensuring EM-1 remains relevant as the principle nuclear effects asset for US Government use. EM-1 is a series of volumes/chapters that document the current knowledge of the phenomena resulting from the detonation of nuclear weapons and describe the subsequent effects on targets, systems and the surrounding environment. In addition, "EM-1 also serves as the main source of material needed for the preparation of operational and employment manuals by the Services." Its applications are varied, ranging from survivability/vulnerability analyses of military systems to use as a "working tool" to perform assessments related to nuclear weapon environments and their effects. Changes in politico-military alignments, with resulting impacts on military force structure, and coupled with new and emerging threats, demand that EM-1 remains current. <br />DTRA seeks a performer with capabilities to assist in the completion of this significant update and provide recommendations and insights along the way to ensure each phase of the EM-1 revision project is successfully accomplished. <br />Specific requirements are as follows:<br /><br />&bull; Ability to create and execute a systematic methodology to organize, develop, peer-review, and publish "state-of-the-art" EM-1 chapters, and to ensure that the Chapter document(s) and their derivative tools continue to meet current user needs and technology requirements. <br />&bull; Ability to research and compile updates on the relevant phenomenology for each EM-1 chapter, as well as peer-review, edit and prepare layouts for the chapter, publish and distribute the chapter within a six (6) to twelve (12) month period of performance (PoP). <br />&bull; Ability to gain access to, store, transmit and handle classified nuclear documents and data up to the Top Secret Restricted Data level. <br />&bull; Ability to facilitate, coordinate and conduct peer-reviews of technical, contributions from subject matter experts in cooperation with various government and industry knowledge-base.<br />&bull; Ability and experience in traditional and electronic publishing reference and text books, journals, periodicals and other publications.</p>
<p>Sources having the capability to meet these requirements are invited to respond to this notice. Responses should be limited to a Six (6) page white paper, in 12 point Courier New font (not including cover page, cover letter and table of contents). Any proprietary concepts of information should be clearly identified as such. Submitted data and information will not be returned. Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice is strictly voluntary. This notice is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.<br />Firms responding should include their DUNS number, CAGE code and indicate whether they are a small business. Firms should include if they are a GSA Schedule holder and if so, what Schedule and Special Item Number(s) (SINs) do they consider appropriate for the work described.<br />Electronic responses are required and shall be submitted to: dexter.simmons@dtra.mil. All emails should include the Reference Number and the submitting organization's name in the subject line. All documentation shall become the property of the Government.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available. Requests for same will be disregarded. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this Sources Sought Notice.

Synopsis: 
The Department of Veterans Affairs MidSouth Healthcare Network VISN 9 currently occupies space in a building under lease in Memphis, TN that will expire. The Government requires clinical space yielding a minimum of 9900 NUSF and a maximum of 9975 NUSF. The lease term requirement is for 5 year firm, with one 5 year non-firm term to renew. The space must be available for occupancy by July 1, 2015. Space within or fronting on the following boundaries will be considered:

North: Egypt Central Road, South: Stage Road, East: Covington Pike, West: Raleigh Millington Road

The lease may be for either an existing building space or new build-to-suit building. The space/building shall meet all current building, seismic, and ADA code requirements.  The space must be on no more than one floor and will need to accommodate the following: The space is continuous on the same floor, accommodating 20 exam rooms, 20 offices, 1 waiting area with reception, 1 conference room, 1 break room, 7 bathrooms (all handicap accessible), 1 clean storage room, and 1 lab.  Space provided shall be within an establishment capable of providing ancillary services such as laboratory, and pharmacy. A minimum of 70 parking spaces is required with 2 to 4 percent of those spaces closest to the building being designated for use by the physically handicapped.  The space shall be located within 1/4 mile walking distance to public transportation, restaurants, shopping, and banks.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.
<p>The Inter-American System of Metrology (SIM) is the Regional Metrology Organization (RMO) for the Americas, one of five current RMOs recognized within the framework of the International Committee on Weights and Measures Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA). SIM's Mission is to promote and support an integrated measurement infrastructure in the Americas that ensures equity in the marketplace, improves the quality of life, and facilitates international trade. The effective functioning of SIM is essential for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to perform its role as the National Metrology Institute (NMI) of the United States. For the international acceptance of NIST measurements, NIST requires SIM to effectively review NIST measurement capabilities, assess the NIST quality systems, and perform regional key comparisons.</p>
<p>The purpose of the SIM School is to provide training for staff of the NMIs in the Western Hemisphere to better enable them to carry out key and supplementary comparisons, review and approve quality systems for their participants, and review calibration and measurement capability claims in support of the CIPM-MRA.</p>
<p>NIST is contemplating hosting a SIM Metrology School event in September of 2015 at the NIST Gaithersburg campus. Approximately 84 attendees from multiple western hemisphere countries are anticipated to be in attendance for six days of training activities.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates the need for a Contractor to provide professional services to complete the logistics of the SIM School event, including communicating with attendees, arranging international and local travel, arranging ground transportation and transportation between the hotel and the NIST Gaithersburg campus, disbursement of per diem, translation services, and meeting facilitation.</p>
<p>Given that this requirement anticipates the Contractor to have access to personally identifiable information (PII), it is anticipated that the Contractor will be required to possess, at a minimum, an authorized FedRAMP security and privacy controls package at a moderate level, or an Authorization to Operate (ATO) letter issued by a Federal Government agency as proof of evidence that the Contractor has been assessed and authorized at the moderate level. If using an ATO letter, that letter shall clearly state that the Contractor has been authorized at the moderate level.</p>
<p>The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) is a United States Law that recognized the importance of information security. The Act requires that all federal agencies develop, document and implement an agency-wide program to provide information security for information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided by or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source. The FISMA requirements are not just for websites, but apply to any vendor, network, or computing environment that includes NIST data and/or PII. FedRAMP was developed to be compliant with FISMA.</p>
<p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Program (FedRAMP) is a risk management program for large outsourced and multi-agency information systems used by the U.S. Government. FedRAMP authorizes and continuously monitors IT services that are used by multiple federal departments and agencies. This approach uses a "do once, use many times" framework that will save cost, time, and staff required to conduct redundant agency security assessments.</p>
<p>The requirement for FedRAMP approval and/or the Authorization to Operate applies when the Contractor, and possibly their subcontractors, will have access to personally identifiable information. This process of assessing the Contractor's processes and procedures with respect to the handling and securing of PII is not limited to electronic data, but also applies to data that is or will be maintained in hard copy form as well.</p>
<p>If the Contractor will use subcontractors for any effort to which this rule is applicable, each party that will store, process, transmit, or have any type of access to personally identifiable information or other sensitive information must possess the above stated FedRAMP authorization or Federal agency-issued ATO letter stating the authorization at the moderate level.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 541611, as those domestic sources having annual revenues of $14.0M or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>After the results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small business are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted is anticipated to be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The following information is required to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: <br /><br />1. Does your company currently possess FEDRAMP or ATO certification from any Government Agency? This question also applies to all subcontractors with whom you would consider working;<br /><br />2. Many of the event's participants will likely speak Spanish, and other will have no English language skills. Please describe your company's skill set and the ability of your company to assist these participants in arranging and communicating the details of their flights, lodging, and transportation considerations, at a minimum;</p>
<p>3. Describe previous contingency plans your company has utilized to minimize the delays associated with unexpected travel obstacles such as flight cancellations;</p>
<p>4. Any relevant documentation which demonstrates your company's overall capability with respect to meeting logistics, communicating with attendees, arranging international and local travel, preparing meeting materials in large volumes in both hard copy and electronic format, and arranging ground transportation and other forms of transportation;</p>
<p>5. Name and business size of the company;</p>
<p>6. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>Submissions must be received not later than December 2, 2014, at 3:30 PM Eastern Time.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS code 721110 that have the capability, experience, and capacity to provide Patient Hotel lodging for National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) patients and/or family members/medical guardians in support of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC), Office of Purchasing and Contracts (OPC) as described in the Statement of Work. It is the intent of the Government to procure services for 12 months with four -one year Option Period(s).
<p><br /><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) is America's clinical research hospital and the world's largest hospital dedicated totally to clinical research. Through clinical research, promising discoveries in the laboratory are translated into better health and health care for all. Currently, there are approximately 1,500 active clinical research studies.</p>
<p>The NIH CC is a unique facility in that all patients are on a research protocol and many patients travel here from across the country and world and may be here for extended stays. Sometimes these patients are alone, may not have many visitors, and/or are without family members for support. Many patients with chronic or acute illnesses have depleted their financial resources and the cost of travel and lodging causes them additional stress. A positive experience with lodging accommodations is an important contributor to a patient's overall wellbeing. Because these patients play a critical role in the NIH mission, lodging costs may be subsidized by the NIH CC.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong> <br />The vision of the NIH Clinical Center is to serve as the nation's premier research hospital for conducting clinical research to improve the health of human kind. It also serves as a national resource for clinical research by developing diagnostic and therapeutic interventions; enhancing systems to ensure the safe, efficient, and ethical conduct of clinical research; training clinical researchers; and leading the response to the nation's public health needs.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center was opened. This state of the art facility is home to inpatient units, day hospitals and research labs and connects to the existing Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, which opened its doors to patients in 1953. Together, the Magnuson and Hatfield centers form the NIH clinical Center, the world's largest clinical research complex, servicing a dual role: providing humane and healing patient care and an environment for clinical researchers to advance clinical science.</p>
<p><br /><strong>SCOPE</strong><br />The NIH Clinical Center intends to establish multiple contracts to obtain hotel accommodations for Clinical Center patients and/or family members/medical guardians at a fixed room rate, at or below the government per diem rate. The NIH Clinical Center intends to award a multiple award contract.<br />Only medically stable patients who would normally be discharged to their home will be considered for lodging in a local hotel.<br />The NIH Clinical Center cannot contractually commit to a fixed number of room nights per year due to individual patient preferences and variations in availability of funds for rooms subsidized by the NIH. On average, there are 1-5 patients per night and typically it is a 1-2 night stay.<br /><br /><strong>LOCATION</strong><br />These facilities must be conveniently located, within a 20 mile radius and/or within a 15 minutes radius to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892 (GPS: 5300 West Cedar Lane, Bethesda, MD 20892), due to demand to meet medical appointments with clinical researchers and unique equipment. Contracts will be awarded to a minimum of two (2) locations in the local Bethesda, Maryland area, a minimum of one (1) location outside of the Bethesda metropolitan area, and a minimum of one (1) location near a Metro subway station. Hotel locations, as specified, are required due to varying needs of the patients and their families; e.g. ability to walk, drive, shuttle, or taxi to the NIH CC or the need to use public transportation and/or a personal car.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement - Any potential Offeror must demonstrate the following:</strong></p>
<p>The government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity, experience and capability for following subject topics:</p>
<p>1. Discuss the feasibility, challenges and ability in hotel lodging for NIH Clinical Center patients and/or family members/medical guardians when reservations are made by authorized NIH personnel.<br />2. Offer a fixed room rate that will be, at or below the government per diem rate.<br />3. Hotel locations will be within a 20 mile radius of the NIH Clinical Center location, and/or within a 15 minutes radius of the Clinical Center where the patients can be seen on-time for his/her appointment.<br />4. Hotel locations will offer transportation services or be conveniently located near local transportation (bus or metro.) Address your ability, experience and capacity to manage hotel lodging for NIH Clinical Center patients and/or family members/medical guardians, addressing the particulars of this effort.</p>
<p><strong>Business Information:<br /></strong><br />a. DUNS<br />b. Company Point of Contact, Phone and Email Address <br />c. Company Address (Company Point of Contact, phone number and email address)<br />d. Type/Size of&nbsp;company, NAICS code, and Social Economic status, as validated at SAMs.<br />e. Current GSA Schedule, if applicable</p>
<p>The synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.

Unfortunately, during winter in Seattle, weather and water conditions are too cold to safely and efficiently train new divers. Because of this, the NOAA Diving Center must look for a warm-water location suitable to conduct three consecutive weeks of training in the January to February timeframe.</p>
<p>The NOAA Diving Center has been conducting its winter classes in Florida. The NDC considered the need for a facility that has classrooms and dive support equipment in close proximity to a pool, open water dive areas, and hyperbaric chambers for treating dive emergencies.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>The NOAA Diver class is a continuous three-week-long course with only one Sunday off. Class schedule and certification requirements allow for a minimum of travel time between classrooms and in-water training sites. The class schedule runs from 0730 - 1930 daily and is based on having all amenities in close proximity. Adding transportation time between classrooms and in-water training sites would result in additional days of training and increased cost for the government.</p>

<RESPDATE>112514
<CONTACT>Patrick T. Dermidoff, Contracting Officer, Email dermidoffpt@state.gov - Crystal Sutliff, Contracting Officer, Email SutliffCM@state.gov
<DESC><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>OC Vapor RFI&nbsp;</strong></div>
<br /><br /><strong>1.0 Purpose</strong><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort by the Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), Defensive Equipment and Armored Vehicles to assess less-than-lethal (LTL) technologies in the area of Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Vapor.  Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), this RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.
<p>DEAV is conducting research to identify both operational and advanced prototype technologies. "Operational" in this context refers to existing technologies and equipment that are currently used in commercial and/or Government application, while "advanced prototype" in this context refers to proven and near-proven technologies that are expected to be available in the commercial and/or Government market in the next 30 to 36 months.</p>
<p>DEAV intends to use the information collected from this RFI to conduct detailed systems analysis that quantifies and evaluates technology readiness and applicability, device or equipment capability, and acquisition (non-recurring) and life-cycle operating costs (recurring). You are invited to respond with information to assist DEAV with its market research to identify potential sources of OC Vapor technology.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Background </strong></p>
<p>DS is responsible for providing a safe and secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.  In support of this mission, DS employs several different LTL systems to protect personnel and property. DS is consistently working to expand the application of LTL technologies to deter and to compel compliance. It is anticipated that additional LTL resources could reduce the need for use of additional, possibly lethal force.</p>
<p><strong>3.0 Requirements </strong></p>
<p>DEAV desires detailed information regarding OC Vapor technologies that can have proven non-lethal effects on human subjects. Submissions can include new applications of proven technologies but this request is not seeking any low Technical Readiness Level (TRL) concepts. The following information, or best available estimate, is requested for each proposed product/technology. If multiple products/technologies are presented by the same entity, the information should be specific to each product/technology. The information requested below will be used by DEAV to assess the benefits of OC Vapor capabilities against typical DS missions.</p>
<p>The following questions/statements should be addressed for each product/technology described in your response to this RFI:</p>
<p>A. General description of your OC Vapor capability. What products/technologies do you have that have the potential to compel compliance by LTL means?</p>
<p>B. What agencies, governments, or other maritime service providers currently use the product/technology you described?</p>
<p>C. If your technology is not currently available as a Commercial Off-the-Shelf product: <br />(1)	Are there any development efforts or test activities currently underway or planned to mature your product/technology and/or assess its maturity?<br />(2)	Describe the effort required to mature your advanced prototype product/technology to a fully tested, ready for production in terms of development time and expense.</p>
<p>D. Please provide a response to the information requested and detail the measure(s) of effectiveness in the following list. (Please define all distances given in meters.)</p>
<p>(1) If  applicable, what is the minimum safe distance and time of exposure for use? (Verified by Manufacturer's Data or testing)<br />(2) What is the maximum effective range? <br />(3) What is the accuracy/dispersal rate while in a static environment? <br />(4) What is the life expectancy of each canister, defined in years? If known, please delineate which component of system is the limiting factor. <br />(5) What is the decontamination for both individuals and for facilities? <br />(6) What is the disposal method of spent canisters?<br />(7) Weapon type: <br />&bull;	How can your products be integrated with currently fielded facility protection systems? <br />&bull;	Can your products be used in open air for crowd dispersal?<br />&bull;	Do your products have the capability of being fired from existing service weapons (i.e. shotgun with a launch cup/40mm)?<br />&bull;	What types of pressurized dispensers (i.e. handheld, fire extinguisher) and/or hand thrown options can you provide? <br /> (8) What is the reliability, in terms of canisters failure rates or duds, for the described products?<br />(9) What arethe Vapor end-effects (Stun, irritant delivery, etc.)?<br />(10) What is the Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost (canisters, concentration levels, launchers, integration with facility protection systems, etc.)? <br />Note:  If providing new technology, describe method of operation, propulsion method, safety features, etc.</p>
<p><strong>4.0 Instructions </strong></p>

As part of the credentialing process, mariners are required to submit applications to the NMC and complete an examination at a Regional Examination Center (REC). The USCG has 20 REC across the United States where mariners can go to submit an application and complete the required examinations. The USCG NMC requires an appointment schedule system that allows mariners across the world to schedule appointments at a REC.</p>
<p>The USCG is requesting that interested companies provide a brief capability/information statement demonstrating the ability to fulfill the otfollowing requirements:</p>
<p>1. Provide web based system access to mariners and USCG users 24/7, 365 days a year from any location worldwide. Access types are the levels of system access assigned to each user who can log in to the system. The login must define what account features they can use. Provide the ability for mariners both internal and external customers to schedule appointments at any of the 20 REC locations in a single application.</p>
<p>2. Provide mariners the ability to schedule appointments for two types services: (1) appointments with a REC for filling out an application and (2) appointments with a REC for taking examinations</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number is N6889815RCBG814. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Joint Base Charleston, intents to award a sole source contract to the contractor to provide the required service for learning organization training.</p>
<p>The 628th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Commonwealth Center for High Performance Organization Inc. 2240 Brandywine Dr Charlottesville, VA, 22901-2907. Market research was performed and information gathered in determining this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 5.207(c) (15) (ii), the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b) (ii). This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals; however responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:</p>
<p>(1) Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC</p>
<p>(2) Nature of action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of this acquisition is to provide learning organization workshop training.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) One source is capable of providing because no other company provides this training.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: Commonwealth Center for High Performance Organization Inc. provided training workshops are custom designed after their assessment of the customer(s) requirement.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: IAW FAR 5.102(a) (2), this notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps.gov), but retained in the contract file to document the rationale for a sole source award.</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon previous awards made for same service and comparison to other installations and the commercial sector for the same services.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: Due to the amount of workshops completed by NPTU, it is more cost efficient to complete the remaining workshops with Commonwealth Center for High Performance Organization Inc.</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: NPTU Charleston has completed eleven learning organization workshops. Additional workshops are required to train personnel who have not received training.</p>
<p>(10) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: <br />Continue to monitor learning workshop changes that will open opportunities for other vendors.</p>
<p>(11) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). (2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). (3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Public Laws 108-77 and 108-78 (19 U.S.C. 3805 note)). (b) The Contractor shall comply with the FAR clauses in this paragraph (b) that the Contracting Officer has indicated as being incorporated in this contract by reference to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (Contracting Officer check as appropriate.) <BR> <BR>[] (1) 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government (SEP 2006), with Alternate I (OCT 1995) (41 U.S.C. 4704 and 10 U.S.C. 2402).

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-CSS-2015-014 and the solicitation is issued as a Request For Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-76, dated 25 JULY 2014.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990 and the Small Business Size Standard is 15 million dollars; All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.  This requirement is released on a restricted set-aside basis to Small Business concerns.</p>
<p>Statement of Objectives<br />The goal of this procurement will be to obtain health care services of a physician by a non-personal services contract, including full time services from a board certified physician in internal medicine serving as the Medical Advisory Investigator (MAI) on an Intramural Research Board (IRB)- approved study conducted at Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, MD. The study supports research protocol number 13-AG-N0378 on the NIH clinical trial number NCT01842399, "Resveratrol and Cardiovascular Health in the Elderly."</p>
<p>Background<br />NIA research protocol number 13-AG-N0378 (i.e. the Resveratrol Study) involves studying the effect of a low and high dose of Resveratrol on vascular markers in non-hospitalized volunteer participants over a one year period. Resveratrol is a nutraceutical and has no known side effects at the dose to be used. Resveratrol is found in the leaves and skin of grapes and studies have shown that resveratrol affects key cellular pathways and molecular targets with a range of biological effects on the aging process. The NIA is beginning a new clinical research trial number NCT01842399 to test the effects of different dose levels of Resveratrol on heart and blood vessel health among healthy overweight nonsmoking volunteers at least 50 years of age. Information and reference material for the NIH Clinical Trial, "Resveratrol and Cardiovascular Health in the Elderly," is located on ClinicalTrials.gov at the following website: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01842399?term=01842399&amp;rank=1</p>
<p>The study will involve one screening visit and four study visits by research participants. The following is a list of procedures that participants will undergo.</p>
<p>Screening: Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.</p>
<p>Blood and urine samples will be collected.</p>
<p>Participants will be given a list of foods that they should avoid eating while on the study.</p>
<p>Participants will be assigned into one of three groups: two groups will take different dose levels of the study drug, and the third group will take a placebo.</p>
<p>First study visit: participants will stay in the NIH clinical center overnight for 2 days of tests.</p>
<p>They will provide blood and urine samples, have body scans to measure fat and muscle mass and will have exercise testing be performed. Muscle biopsy will also be performed.</p>
<p>Receive initial dose of the study drug, and will continue to take this dose for as long as they are on the study.</p>
<p>Second visit: The second visit will be 16 weeks after the first one. It will take only 2 hours, and repeat most of the tests from the screening visit.</p>
<p>Third visit: The third visit will be 16 weeks later. It will involve an overnight stay. Most of the tests from the second visit will be repeated.</p>
<p>Fourth visit: The fourth and final visit will be 16 weeks later. It will involve an overnight stay. Most of the tests from the initial study visit (including the scans and the exercise tests) will be repeated.</p>

The Contracting Officer has indicated the following clauses listed in paragraph (b) as applicable and are hereby incorporated by reference: (4) 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards (JUL 2013); (8) 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment (AUG 2013); (25) 52.222-3, Convict Labor (JUN 2003); (27) 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (FEB 1999); (28) 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity (MAR 2007); (30) 52.222-36, Equal Opportunity for Workers with Disabilities; (39) 52.223-18, Encouraging Contractor Policies to Ban Text Messaging While Driving (AUG 2011); (43) 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases (JUN 2008); and (49) 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management (JUL 2013).

<p>(xiii) Sole Source Justification - OMHA is currently leasing office space from Jones, Lang and LaSalle at 100 SE 2nd Street, Miami, Florida 33131. The building has a garage facility that is available to tenants for a monthly fee, and the garage facility is owned and administered only by the City of Miami Parking Authority (MPA). OMHA provides parking spaces to the Supervisory Administrative Law Judges; visitors; and visitors/employees with handicap accessibility. Because the City of Miami Parking Authority garage located at the OMHA facility at 100 SE 2nd street is the only secured, structured facility providing 24/7 access, located at the same address as the agency, it is the only viable option for parking services.</p>
<p>The facility must be secured by either a gate or an attendant because OMHA government employees, primarily Supervisory Administrative Law Judges, are at a higher security risk. They carry valuable equipment and any PII documentation removed from the office must be secured. No other garage is located on-site.</p>
<p>Travel from the garage to the OMHA facility is secure and ensures the safety of the Supervisory Administrative Law Judges and the equipment/documents they carry, especially those documents related to cases, hearings, and litigation.</p>
<p>(xiv) The clauses at FAR 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (MAR 2000); FAR 52.232-40, Providing Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors (DEC 2013); HHSAR 352.203-70, Anti-Lobbying (MAR 2012); and HHSAR 352.222-70, Contractor Cooperation in Equal Employment Opportunity Investigations (JAN 2010), apply to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xv) DPAS - N/A</p>
<p>(xvi) Quotes are due on November 21, 2014, 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, electronically to the Contract Specialist at khristine.agnello@psc.hhs.gov.</p>

<p>(xiii) Brand Name Justification - The HHS Office of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA) is the HHS leader for the dissemination of health-related information and is responsible for managing several high-level social media channels that provide sensitive information to the public regarding the Secretary's Twitter and Facebook accounts, as well as several priority websites such as Flu.gov, Foodsafety.gov, and Mentalhealth.gov.</p>
<p>ASPA requires specific types of data to be available when engaging and monitoring social media accounts to determine the appropriate messaging of health-related information with the American public. In order to obtain this data, ASPA requires a social media monitoring tool that provides standard functionality (web platform, unlimited accounts, help support, data tagging) as well as some unique characteristics, as described below.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard functionality characteristics, ASPA requires a tool that enables staff to provide analysis and data mining of all social media-related activities related to a query, topic, phrases, program, etc., without any limitations based on the volume of data. Most tools require a cost increase for access to a specific number of "mentions" or "queries" which in turn are used to enable data mining and analysis by the tool.</p>
<p>Hootsuite uberVU is unique because it offers analysis of all social media-related activities through an algorithm that does not require viewing of all social media "mentions" by the user. Instead, its algorithm uses a sampling to provide for holistic reporting of sentiment, demographics, geographic data, and other characteristics on any query/key term/mention to make informed predictions about locations and demographics.</p>
<p>Hootsuite uberVU also provides for additional refinements and contextual information for the analysis and reporting of social media activity to include geo-based location and gender-based information. This feature allows ASPA to measure the effectiveness of its outreach efforts in a particular city/state and with specific targeted audiences. Competitors of uberVU use only user profile data and tagging of a post by account owners.</p>
<p>Finally, Hootsuite uberVU provides automated reporting and allows federal staff to customize the thresholds for each report - it does not set one parameter for all reports. These reports are distributed to stakeholders who may not have access to the tool, such as high-level HHS staff leadership, White House personnel, or Congressional members who are interested in specific topics. Hootsuite uberVU does not require account ownership to be established to view reports, thereby allowing federal staff to easily distribute reports to external stakeholders as necessary.</p>
<p>(xiv) The clauses at FAR 52.232-40, Providing Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors (DEC 2013); HHSAR 352.203-70, Anti-Lobbying (MAR 2012); and HHSAR 352.222-70, Contractor Cooperation in Equal Employment Opportunity Investigations (JAN 2010), apply to this acquisition.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

(1) The solicitation number VA259-15-Q-0087 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).

(2) This solicitation is 100% Small Business set-aside under NAICS code 339113.

(3) Contract Line Item number:	1

Item 	Product#		Description							Qty
1	RD-0617		HW Six Leg Offset DB IV Pole					20
				


PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS
IV Poles RD-0617

The VA Salt Lake City Health Care System (VASLCHCS) is in need of IV poles which are steadier to hold the weight of the Alaris pumps.  These new Alaris IV pumps are heavier and bulkier than the previous pumps and require a sturdier more heavy duty IV pole for patient and provider safety.  For safety purposes, every IV pole must contain a 6 legged base to deal with the heavier pumps.  The typical IV pole has 4 - 5 legs at the base; Pryor RD-0617, HW six leg ofsset db IV pole has 6 legs.  The most common type of IV stand found in American hospitals is the free-standing mobile pole.  All designs of this type are very similar.  The primary difference is found in the design of the base, although the hangers and accessories may also vary slightly.  Stands of this design are usually on casters which make them very easy to move, by either the patient or a nurse. This gives the patient the opportunity to get out of bed and comfortably move around on his own.  The primary disadvantage of this design is that it is prone to falling over. The large height and relatively small base make it somewhat unstable.  The Alaris IV pumps are heavier than the previous pumps and require a more heavy duty IV pole.
Features
RD-617
o	This stand is designed to safely support Plum and Symbiq IV pumps or other IV infusion devices and their companion IV fluid containers.
o	6-legs
o	27" diameter, low-center-of-gravity steel base with epoxy finish

However, the offeror is reminded that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as received, without discussion.</p>
<p>COMPENSATION: The government shall evaluate the compensation, in the form of percentage of monthly gross income and a quoted monthly minimum amount (a minimum compensation of 10% or $750 or whichever is greater with $50 incremental increases per year), on the basis of the best value to the government. The government is not required to select the highest compensation but may select the offeror whose compensation is realistic and attainable.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote (for example, experience) or their compensation. Communication conducted to explain their offerors or resolve minor or clerical errors or will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for discussions.</p>

<p>A CONTINUING RESOLUTION, also known as a "CR" is legislation enacted by congress that continues funding for specific ongoing activities if the fiscal year appropriation has not been enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>"Due to the Continuing Resolution, funds are presently available through December 11, 2014 (H.J. Res. 124). The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond December 11, 2014. If funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance beyond the above cited date, the Contractor will receive notification in writing by the Contracting Officer."</p>
<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employees referred to IHS through this contract.<br />Fingerprints must be completed and adjudicated prior to services being performed under this contract.<br />No contract award shall be made to any vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov throughout the duration of the contract. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.<br />In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.<br />The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your proposal must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>Factor 1: Technical capability<br />All quoters shall provide a technical proposal to include how the offeror will perform the contract in accordance with the specifications relevant to the attached statement of work. The Technical Proposal shall be as specific and complete as to clearly demonstrate to the Government that the offeror has a thorough comprehension of and capabilities to provide all aspects of the solicitation requirements. Statements that the quoter understands the requirement and can or will comply with the requirements will be considered inadequate. Quoters whose technical submittal are rated "Unacceptable" will be rejected and removed from further competition.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Past Performance <br />The quoter shall demonstrate relevant past performance or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance. Relevant past performance is performance under contracts or efforts within the past three (3) years prior to the solicitation closing date that is the same as or similar to the work described by this solicitation.</p>
<p>To demonstrate its past performance, the quoter shall identify up to two (2) of its most relevant contracts or efforts within the past three (3) years, and provide any other information the quoter considers relevant to the requirements of the solicitation. Quoters should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts or efforts to the requirements of the solicitation. Past Performance will be assessed as follows: Evaluation will focus only on work experience already performed. Work yet-to-be performed, and work prior to the last three (3) years, will not be considered.

<p>The quoter shall complete a "Past Performance Information Form" for each reference submitted. The form is Attachment 1 to the combined synopsis/solicitation. The Government reserves the right to consider past performance report forms received after the due date of the solicitation and to contact references for verification or additional information.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Price<br />Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement. The quoter shall provide sufficiently detailed information as to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the proposed price.

<p>(a) The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government based on the following factors: Technical capability, past performance and price. Award will be made to the low price, technically acceptable offeror, after which no other offers will be evaluated.</p>
<p>Factor I: Technical capability - The Government will evaluate the quoters technical submission to determine compliance with the Performance Work Statement. The technical submissions will be rated as either "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable". Acceptable is defined as meeting the government's requirements and Unacceptable is defined as does not meet the government's requirement's. If a quote's technical submission is determined to be Unacceptable it will no longer be evaluated or considered for award.</p>
<p>Factor II: Past Performance Acceptability: The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the quoter's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the quoter's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertains to the services outlined in the solicitation requirements. Past performance will be rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis in accordance with the ratings and description outlined below:</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings <br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable: Based on quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully provide requested support services, or the quoter's performance record is unknown .<br />Unacceptable: Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully provide the required support services.</p>
<p>Note: Quoters lacking relevant past performance history or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorable or unfavorable on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. If the Contracting Officer determines that a vendor's Past Performance is "unacceptable," that vendor's entire submittal will no longer be considered for further competition or award.</p>
<p>Evaluation will focus only on work experience already performed. Work yet-to-be performed, and work prior to the last 5 years, will not be considered. In addition, performance data will only be assessed for those references demonstrating at least 1 year of completed performance prior to the closing date of the solicitation.</p>
<p>In order to be considered Technically Acceptable the offeror must receive an "Acceptable" rating in both technical capability and past performance (Factor I and Factor II). Failure to obtain an "Acceptable" rating in Factor I or Factor II will result in an overall "Unacceptable" rating and elimination from the competition.</p>
<p>Factor III: Price: Quotes will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a). Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit additional information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar services, sales history for the same or similar services, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br /><br />The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: It is the offeror's responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: <br> This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in FAR 15.201e. This is not a solicitation or request for competitive proposals. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted and the Government will not reimburse respondents for preparation of the response. <br> The Joint Project Management Office Medical Countermeasure Systems (JPM-MCS), under the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), is the DOD organization responsible for the advanced development, procurement, fielding, and sustainment of medical treatment, prophylactic, and diagnostic capabilities against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents. <br>  <br> Information gathered in response to this RFI will be used to support the Joint Product Director for Diagnostics (JPdM Dx) in strategic planning for development of the Next Generation Diagnostics System Increment 2 (NGDS Inc 2) acquisition strategy.  Specifically, information gathered will be reviewed as part of a market survey in support of the NGDS Inc 2 acquisition program planned to begin August 2014. <br>   <br> The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the NGDS Increment 2 program is 334516  quote mark Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, quote mark  which has a small business size standard of 500 employees. Under this NAICS code, the Government will consider a concern with 500 or fewer employees to be a small business. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND and REQUIREMENTS: <br>  <br> JPM-MCS is interested in collecting information from companies who are currently in the U.S. domestic healthcare market or are considering a future entry into the market for FDA-cleared diagnostics for human diseases caused by exposure to biological threat agents.

<DESC>IMPORTANT NOTICE:
THIS NOTIFICATION SUPERCEDES THE PREVIOUS MARKET RESEARCH POSTED ON OCTOBER 21, 2014. PLEASE REVIEW THE FOLLOWING FOR LOCATION DETAILS.

Market Research Sources Sought/Request for Information
 Renewable Energy Generation/Production US Navy Spain 

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  THIS SYNOPSIS AND MARKET RESEARCH/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ARE INFORMATIONAL AND FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS WILL NOT BE ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  

No contract will be awarded from this announcement, and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice.  This notice is a market research tool used to obtain information only and to identify contractors who possess the capabilities to provide services as described below.
  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) EUROPE AFRICA AND SOUTH WEST ASIA (EURAFSWA) is performing this market research to aid in the development of its acquisition approach. 

N62470-14-R-6024: MARKET RESEARCH/ REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION/PRODUCTION TO SUPPLY LOCATIONS IN ROTA, SPAIN.

NAVFAC EURAFSWA is performing research to determine whether renewable electric power generation opportunities in off base locations are available to transmit power across the existing local grid to Naval Station Rota.  NAVFAC EURAFSWA is particularly interested in renewable energy systems that have been newly constructed. Power purchase costs would need to be within normal market prices (rates) for the duration of the contract.
 NAVFAC EURAFSWA seeks to identify responsible sources and obtain information regarding opportunities and risks associated with renewable energy production.  The results of this Sources Sought/Request for Information (SS/RFI) will assist in developing a potential RFP that may be issued at a later date.

As permitted by FAR Part 10, NAVFAC EURAFSWA is requesting responses, comments, recommendations and suggestions as Market Research and Request for Information to assist in the development of an acquisition strategy. The intent is to identify potential proposers and collect information on any conventional or renewable energy generation that is economically attractive and feasible. NAVFAC EURAFSWA desires to solicit maximum industry participation allowing formulation of a concise acquisition process in a timely manner.

This Request for Information shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the U.S.
 Government. The U.S. Government does not intend to finance any effort associated with this SS/RFI nor guarantee award of a contract on the basis of this RFI.


Synopsis of Relevant Conditions at Naval Station Rota

Naval Station Rota currently operates with an average electrical load of approximately 6 MW in winter and 12 MW in summer, with a peak load of roughly 12 MW. The highest load occurs in the summer months due to the HVAC demand driven by the warm weather conditions.  The response should address electrical integration with the existing power supply e.g. the varying capacity of the potential renewable plant relative to the purchase of brown power to supply the required load.

NAVFAC EURAFSWA will not provide land for this project.
  The project is required to be newly constructed, any renewable energy credits would be sold exclusively to the Navy. 

Currently, all electrical power is purchased via competitive procurement. Power is distributed across the site via Navy maintained and operated distribution systems. 

The responses should address electrical integration with the existing power supply e.g. the varying capacity of the potential renewable plant relative to the purchase of brown power to supply the required load.

<DESC>***RaPDS RFI extended to 01 December 2014. ****
***Industry scheduled for 19 November at 13:30-15:30. ****


SPAWAR Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), Sea
Warrior Program Office (PMW 240), Orlando, is issuing this Market Survey RFI for
determining Small Business capabilities and is soliciting information from potential
sources to provide products and services associated with the full lifecycle of various PMW
240 programs (i.e., requirements analysis, analysis of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)
products, integration, testing and test support, implementation/deployment, sustainment
and operations support, etc.).  There are two systems that may be used for Sample
Tasks in a Request for Proposal (RFP), should one be issued.  These systems are the
Navy Manpower Requirements System (NMRS) and the Department of Defense (DOD)
Information Technology (IT) Portfolio Repository (DITPR)/Department of The Navy (DON)
Application and Database Management System (DADMS).




The Government anticipates this effort to be placed as a Indefinite
Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Multiple Award Contract (MAC) using Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 (Contracting by Negotiation) procedures. Task
orders will be issued under FAR Part 16.505 (Ordering) procedures. Some orders may be
issued using FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items).  Award is anticipated to no
less  than three (3) but no more than five (5) small businesses. The anticipated period of
performance will consist of one five-year base period, with one three-year option period.


The estimated value for the total contract period (base plus option) is approximately
$300 million.  The contract will include software development, configuration of a COTS
product and integration with other SPAWAR IT systems, and software sustainment of
various systems such as the NMRS and DITPR/DADMS proposed sample tasks.

<DESC>This justification provides the rationale for limiting competition to one source for the acquisition of Launch Vehicle Mission Reliability Probabilistic Risk Analysis Support. This contract will require a five-year period of performance.	In accordance with FAR 8.405-3(d)(2), the base period for this BPA will be one year and there will be four one-year options.	The five-year period of performance is required to perform the necessary analysis for the Mars 2020 nuclear mission to be launched in July 2020. Under the proposed procurement action, Advanced Systems Concepts Associates, Inc. (ASCA) will provide the probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) and specific expertise necessary to develop and quantify accident sequence scenarios and probabilities to support risk analysis for space missions. The U.S. Government, on any space mission that carries significant amounts of nuclear material, must produce an environmental impact assessment in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and a nuclear launch risk assessment in accordance with the Presidential Directive/National Security Council Memorandum 25 (PD/NSC-25) nuclear launch approval process. ASCA developed a proprietary analytical methodology framework and data set that was applied to the Cassini Mission EIS and SAR databook probabilistic assessment analyses. ASCA utilizes a proprietary process involving the creation of Event Sequence Diagrams (ESD) populated with launch vehicles' accident failure scenarios and outcomes.	Once branch point probabilities are added to the ESDs, it allows ASCA to develop an independent method of determining the probability of launch vehicle failure accidents occurring in relation to mission elapsed time and the overall reliability of the launch vehicle.  Another unique capability ASCA provides is their database of all launches of all launch vehicles worldwide.	This database allows ASCA and NASA to examine all types of launch vehicle failures for all U.S. and international launches in an effort to validate branch point probabilities and launch vehicle accident probabilities.	These two unique capabilities provided by ASCA are essential to the NEPA and PD/NSC-25 launch approval processes.
