<DESC><p>KC-10A aircraft maintenance training is still accomplished on actual aircraft; these training activities have an impact on mission capabilities, and mission requirements regularly delay maintenance training. All training is conducted by Air Force instructors. These MTDs will replace the need for operational aircraft for certain tasks and allow trainers to be utilized for the current Air Force courses. The MTDs will be used by all AFSCs currently being taught at Field Training Detachments (FTDs) and Maintenance Qualification Training Program (MQTP). The MTDs may also be used during the 3-level AFSC awarding courses for KC-10crew chiefs.</p>
The Agile Combat Support Directorate, Simulators Division is conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the capabilities to deliver Maintenance Training Devices (MTD) for the KC-10A aircraft. The KC-10 MTDs shall be delivered to Travis AFB, CA and McGuire AFB, NJ. The Air Force is looking to deliver one (1) full engine trainer and one (1) Main Landing Gear Trainer (MLGT) to each of the training sites (four trainers total).<br /><br />

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Fort Leonard Wood, MO intends to sole source extended custodial service for the Child Development Center, School Aged Services, and Pippen Youth Center to Carolina Clean, Inc. under the existing contract, W911S7-11-D-0017. The current contract period of performance expires 30 June 2012. The Government is choosing not to exercise the available option period, but rather will utilize FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services for an approximate 2.5 month period of performance. This extension is being synopsized and supported by a sole source justification and approval because extension pricing was not originally evaluated.  <br><br>The incumbent contractor, Carolina Clean, Inc., has the equipment, personnel, and requisite knowledge to support the current requirements contract. A new contract would require start-up time, and the immediate availability of resources to execute the scope of work, which is simply not available through competitive means in the minimal amount of time left before the current contract expires. Personnel working at child care centers require background checks and a more thorough screening than do other service employees.<br><br>Any responses to this notice should be sent to the Contract Specialist, Ashley Jenkins, at ashley.m.jenkins27.civ@mail.mil. All responses to this notice will be reviewed and taken into consideration.

<DESC>ARCATA ASSOCIATES, Inc. has a requirement for 2 each 98-034-001-bo, video transmission system, 2 each 1550NM, Optical Transceivers, 2 each License Maintenance Fee, 1 each Training and installation Support, 2 each 98-020-003-00, TNP-100 Multi-Ti-Service Access multiplexer with Anolog Telemetry A/V & IRIG Software., 2 each RJ45 Ethernet Cables, 2 each 98-060-001-AO Rack Mount Kit, 2 each License, 1 each Training. Arcata Associates, Inc. intends to purchase the items from IPtec 5673 W. Las Postias Blvd. Pleasanton, CA 94588 A single source for this acquisition is required based on the necessity for compatibility with existing equipment currently in use and a reduction in time and cost.  The existing equipment is the same make and model as that requested in the purchase request and is propeitary to IPtec. The existing equipment has been tested and validated to perform the necessary functions for the project. Remaining with the same manufacturer avoids the additional time and expense of having to identify a new source and perform testing to verify that the equipment meets the operational needs.	It also saves a significant amount of money because there will be no need to replace exisiting equipment.  This cost savings is extremely important with the current budget issues within the Government. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 31, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

Assess the current capability of industry to modify or adjust their current commercial and government practices to meet specific unique requirements of the FAA.

The Government will not reimburse any costs for providing information, documentation, and or data submitted or preparation costs for submittals in response to this notice.
The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  Since this is for information and planning purposes, no evaluation letters or results will be issued to respondents. 
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do an unrestricted open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.

Briefly describe your ability to meet these requirements. 9.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for NASA Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) code base, known as Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION). NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Ohio University.  Ohio University has been providing this service for several years under Grant Number NNX09AD87G, and has intimate experience with the NASA ION code base and its support requirements.  Ohio University currently maintains the existing automated build and test environment for the code that has been validated by the NASA DTN Research Project, maintains the secure code distribution servers and provides support services and documentation for the ION releases.  Ohio University offers unique capabilities in support of the NASA DTN code base that would be difficult and unreasonable to attempt to recreate with another provider with the limited resources available to the project. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 23, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for Finite Element (FE) Modeling of Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) images of the hip in support of Space Life Sciences research efforts on the impact of space flight on the skeletal system. NASA/JSC intends to purchase this service from the University of California-Irvine (UCI). This justification provides a rationale for contracting by other than full and open competition.  As part of this procurement, a proprietary FE Modeling tool developed by UCI researchers will be applied to QCT images of the hip.  The subsequent data will then be added to UCI's existing database which NASA will access as part of this effort. This proprietary database represents the largest known and most robust collection of QCT scans with FE modeling of the hip.  UCI is the only known source with a demonstrated method that has previously been applied to large and diverse population cohorts and that also possesses the data required for NASA's research.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial service using FAR Part 12.    Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 23, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition is Lauri Hansen and can be reached at lauri.n.hansen@nasa.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.
<p>Background<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), is anticipating re-competing a full and open competition contract for support for interdisciplinary studies. A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Occupational and environmental investigations play an important role in this effort because well-documented, high-level exposures to potential carcinogens occur in the workplace and because environmental exposures can impact a large segment of the population. <br /><br />The fundamental mission of the OEEB is to identify and clarify causes of cancer, with a focus on occupational and environmental exposures. To achieve its goals, OEEB's approach has been to (1) merge epidemiology, quantitative exposure assessment, and biologic and genetic components into multi-disciplinary investigations to identify carcinogens, clarify exposure-response relationships, and enhance our mechanistic understanding of carcinogenesis; (2) conduct investigations to develop and improve methods for exposure assessment and to evaluate and incorporate state-of-the-art biomarker assays into its molecular epidemiology studies; (3) facilitate the development of consortia to efficiently create scientific opportunities that are difficult to achieve in any one study; (4) develop and maintain resources for occupational and environmental epidemiology and exposure assessment; and (5) assist in training the next generation of occupational, environmental, and molecular epidemiologists.<br /><br />The philosophic focus of OEEB is to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate quantitative exposure assessment and molecular epidemiology to provide new insights into cancer etiology, chemical carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. Approximately twenty-five studies will likely receive support under the contract.</p>
<p>This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261200700044C held by Westat, Inc. <br /><br />Project Requirement<br />This support services contract is essential for OEEB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate quantitative exposure assessment and molecular epidemiology to provide new insights into cancer etiology, chemical carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. The NCI/OEEB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for all phases of occupational and environmental epidemiologic studies, including support for exposure assessment and molecular components, and coordination of activities related to genome-wide association studies (GWAS); and in conducting and simultaneously managing concurrent, multiple, large (including international) epidemiologic investigations of cancer etiology. The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international and field (case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional) studies. <br /><br />Some of the major activities of the contract include:</p>
<p>a. pilot test data collection forms and instruments, including computer-assisted personal (CAPI) and computer-assisted telephone (CATI) interviews; <br />b. train interviewers and abstractors, including development of training documents under guidance of NCI;<br />c. interview study subjects and their family; <br />d. trace study subjects; including locating cancer patients and/or their relatives, selection of controls through such methods as random digit dialing and acquisition of appropriate study population rosters or files (e.g., departments of motor vehicles); <br />e. abstract medical records and other relevant data sources; <br />f. trace to determine vital status or locate subjects; <br />g. obtain death certificates and cancer incidence records; <br />h. obtain medical records; <br />i. select appropriate molecular epidemiology procedures to understand cancer etiology with guidance from NCI; <br />j. edit and maintain quality control and standardization of data to ensure appropriate and valid results; <br />k. arrange for the collection, handling, transport, and storage of biologic, industrial hygiene and environmental samples; <br />l. coordinate and monitor a biologic specimen program; <br />m. prepare data management systems that monitor study progress and data flow;<br />n. assess occupational and environmental exposures using various techniques, including (for the environmental assessment) geographic information systems;<br />o. develop and monitor subcontracts; <br />p. conduct coding of records, questionnaires and death certificates; <br />q. prepare and maintain computer databases;<br />r. provide documentation of study decisions and study procedure manuals; <br />s. identify qualified industrial hygienists and exposure assessors; <br />t. identify qualified laboratories to analyze biologic, industrial hygiene and environmental samples; <br />u. develop files and reports of work to allow efficient and easy transfer of data and knowledge to the next support services contractor;<br />v. develop coordination and liaison at the local or international level with collaborating investigators or institutions whose cooperation is needed for the conduct of a study<br />w. close coordination of GWAS efforts with the relevant NCI repositories and laboratories, including trouble shooting all aspects of data and DNA sample preparation; prepare and maintain subject data logs and DNA manifests; selection of DNA samples for analysis based on review of pre-genotyping quality control reports; coordination of the post-GWAS replication efforts including selecting DNA samples for analysis; coordinating data collection and harmonization across studies for subsequent gene-environment interaction analyses; and preparation and QC/QA of phenotype data linked to GWAS data sets for submission to dbGaP.</p>
<p>The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990. It is anticipated that a cost reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded with a 1-year base period and four (4) 1-year options of performance beginning on or about September 28, 2012.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically on or about April 26, 2012 and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted. IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION Mil ANY AMENDMENTS.</p>

<DESC>The Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU), Panama City, FL, intends to award a sole-source, short-term bridge, firm fixed price contract to the QinetiQ North American, Inc.  890 Explorer Blvd., Huntsville, AL 35806-2832 to satisfy the need for automated data processing equipment operations at Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU), which cannot be satisfied with in-house resources.  The purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The incumbent contractor personnel have in-depth knowledge of the existing NEDU automated data processing equipment and procedures.  QinetiQ is the only contractor capable of providing the required support without an interruption of service.
 Any interruption would be unacceptable and would negatively impact critical mission requirements. This acquisition is an interim measure for three months, with two-three month option periods, until a competitive follow-on contract can be awarded.

<DESC>The government intends to make a sole source award to Abiomed, INC., for the Impella  2.5 Perculaneous Circulatory Support System.  Abiomed is a small business that has been identified as the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Impella  2.5 Perculaneous Circulatory Support System. The Impella technology is the only percutaneously inserted circulatory support device that can provide direct, active unloading of the left ventricle without the need for atrial (transeptal) puncture.  This unique, minimally-invasive technology employs a microaxial pump which is placed into the aorta by means of a catheter that is inserted not the femoral artery.  The Impella 2.5 only requires access to one vessel in order to provide direct circulatory support of up to 2.5 liters/minute. As such, the contractor is the identified company qualified to provide the Government with the required supplies. 

Contract will be a onetime buy and a firm fixed contract.  The listed vendor is a small business. The solicitation is to be issued as a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334510.  The size standard is 500 employees. This information is only used for classification purposes. Contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive a contract award.  Contractors may access the CCR at http://www.cccr.gov. 

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. All parties offering equivalent equipment must respond no later than May 24, 2012 by 12:00 PM CST. 

Place of Delivery: Overton Brooks VA Medical Center, 510 East Stoner Avenue, Shreveport, LA 71101.

<RESPDATE>061412
<CONTACT>Estela M. Diaz, "CARPOL Solutions No-Cost Model", Phone n/a, Fax n/a, Email CARPOL@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for No-Cost Contracts<br /><br />Sources Sought: Seeking information regarding a possible no-cost model contract for the delivery of certification, accreditation, registration, permitting, and other licensing (CARPOL) activities to the public.
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Marketing and Regulatory Programs Business Services (MRPBS) is considering the possibility of entering into a no-cost contract to deliver CARPOL-related services to the public. The agency is contemplating reducing the cost of maintaining existing systems by shifting the delivery of CARPOL services to industry.</p>
<p>The vendor would be required to comply with Federal security requirements, remain in compliance with all requirements regarding access to personally identifiable information (PII), and meet certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) requirements under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). The vendor would also be required to consider APHIS mission-related requirements governed by applicable appropriations, authorizing legislations, and other Federal laws under which the agency is required to operate.</p>
<p>No-cost contracts are not subject to either the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) or the Agriculture Acquisition Regulations (AGAR). The terms and conditions for a no-cost contract will be negotiated in accordance with FAR Part 12 (Commercial Contracts) to protect the rights of both parties. A no-cost contract does not violate the Anti-deficiency Act because the Government would not incur financial liability for any CARPOL-related services provided by the vendor. APHIS would apply statutory requirements under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) for procurements by Federal agencies (property or services) applicable to civilian agencies (41 U.S.C. &sect; 253).</p>
<p>Agency Background Information:<br />APHIS is organizationally located under USDA Marketing and Regulatory Programs (MRP). MRP's mission is to facilitate domestic and international marketing of U.S. agricultural products and ensure the health and wellbeing of animals and plants. The overarching goals of the USDA MRP agencies are:</p>
<p>&bull;Faster delivery of services and products<br />&bull;Improved customer relations<br />&bull;Incorporation of efficiency and innovation to streamline operational solutions<br />&bull;Perpetuation of effective change management</p>
<p>APHIS' mission is threefold: (1) provide leadership in ensuring the health and wellbeing of animals and plants, <br />(2) improve agricultural productivity and competitiveness, and (3) contribute to the national economy and public health. In supporting USDA's mission to protect American agriculture and natural resources, APHIS issues CARPOL authorizations of various forms to allow the movement of specifically regulated agricultural commodities into and through the United States.</p>
<p>APHIS currently provides a Web-based system for users to apply for permits, check the status of their permit applications, and view issued permits. The system is integrated with the U.S. Department of Treasury www.pay.gov site to process payments of any fees. Federal import permitting officials use the APHIS system workflow capabilities to review the applications and issue permits.</p>
<p>In addition, Federal and State enforcement officials use the APHIS system to verify the validity of import permits. <br />The system users include APHIS import permitting officials; other Federal Government employees; State agriculture officials; and private individuals, universities, and businesses. The system exchanges data with separate systems utilized by other Federal Government agencies that are also involved in the inspection and movement of imported commodities under APHIS' regulatory authority. These other agencies include the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>Internally, Plant Inspection Stations and Investigative and Enforcement Services staff use the system to validate permits and exchange data with several IT systems. In addition to the current Web-based system, APHIS has other CARPOL processes that interact with the import permitting process as well as other electronic sources of structured CARPOL data. The USDA and its cooperators issue approximately 550,000 permit-type certificates per year.</p>
<p>APHIS' primary goal is to have one flexible, expandable system that will fulfill its common data needs for CARPOL services and that optimizes user productivity, maximizes data value, and is compliant with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations, and directives.</p>
<p>APHIS seeks to expand and improve its sharing, reporting, and analytical capabilities of CARPOL data and business processes. The foundation of a replacement system or service will be improved business processes identified in a business process assessment and reengineering final product produced by APHIS. An additional goal is to leverage, where possible, current technology and other resources.</p>
<p>All interested sources in the market&nbsp;<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WITH or WITHOUT</span></em></strong> experience in no-cost model contracts, are encouraged to provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Name of source (company/organization) including point of contact to include name, address, telephone number, and email. Include business status (small, large, or other).</p>
<p>2. Corporate or organization technical capabilities.</p>
<p>3. References for three contracts (Government, commercial, or other) within the past 3 years for similar CARPOL-related systems or services (not necessarily under a no-cost model).</p>
<p>4. Approximate net worth of company capitol for assessment of financial strength.</p>
<p>5. If referenced source is under a no-cost model, please provide contact information for at least three applications under this contracting model that you have provided to customers (at least one Government customer) to include:</p>
<p>a. Name of entity and customer contact information. <br />b. Include data when application was created and how long operated.<br />c. Explain how the no-cost model works in referenced source.<br />d. How are costs recovered (i.e., what is the third-party pricing structure)?</p>
<p>Sources responding to this posting are responsible for appropriately marking any information that is proprietary in nature. This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). Therefore, no proposals will be accepted. No contracts will result from any submission. The Government will not award a contract based on the information received; nor will we reimburse participants for information provided. Information requested is strictly voluntary and is for informational purposes only.</p>
<p>Responses must be emailed to CARPOL@aphis.usda.gov and include the phrase <strong>"CARPOL Solutions No-Cost Model"</strong> in the subject line. No telephone communication will be accepted.</p>
<p>Sources responding to this notice will not be entitled to the results.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for market research purposes. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.
<p>After the results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small business resellers are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST has been in collaboration with the FBI since 1968 in conducting research on automated fingerprint-matching systems. Since 2008, with the help and support from the FBI, the current legacy fingerprint-matching test environment at NIST is in a transitional phase to <br />update the current supercomputer based architecture to the new blade-based Next Generation Identification (NGI) system currently in operation at the FBI.</p>
<p>The new blade-based NGI system architecture utilizes a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)fingerprint-matcher system produced by Safran MorphoTrak specifically for the FBI's <br />current operational system. The FBI has requested NIST to install the identical software on FBI supplied hardware to remain in sync with the FBI's operational system.</p>
<p>The FBI has provided NIST the necessary hardware as well as funds to purchase the COTS fingerprint-matcher MorphoBSS produced by Safran MorphoTrak to be installed on the provided hardware. Transition and updating of the NIST fingerprint-matching system to duplicate the subsystem of the FBI's new NGI system, specifically the MorphoBSS software provided by Safran MorphoTrak, is critical for NIST to remain in sync with the operational <br />behavior of the FBI system, to ensure repeatability of the NIST testing framework, and to maintain this long standing collaboration. Procurement of the MorphoTrak MBSS technology allows NIST and MorphoTrak to utilize and capitalize on the technological advances that exist with fingerprint data extraction and matching presently deployed in the FBI's NGI Increment 1.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking vendors, other than the software manufacturer, who are authorized resellers for MorphoTrak and can provide required software. Specifically, MorphoBSS SGI IdFP/RISC Testbed Software to include SW License Agreement.</p>
<p>The following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Documentation which clearly demonstrates that the company is an authorized reseller for MorphoTrak;</p>
<p>2. Name and business size of the company that is an authorized reseller for the required software;</p>
<p>3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of the required software;</p>
<p>4. Indication of whether the required software is currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s);</p>
<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>All documentation must be sent to Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. E-mail address: CAROL.WOOD@NIST.GOV.</p>
<p>Submission must be received not later than 3:30 PM local time on May 22, 2012.</p>
<p>Vendors shall identify their business size as Small Business in accordance with North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541519 with Exception 2for Value Added Resellers; the Small Business Size Standard is $25.0M.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.<br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong>Recognizing the untapped potential of libraries, librarians, and information services to aid in the nation's disaster management efforts, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Board of Regents' Long Range Plan (2006-2016) Subcommittee recommended that NLM create a "Disaster Information Management Research Center" (DIMRC) to support national emergency preparedness and response efforts. Since the Center opened in 2008, NLM has worked to train and support librarians to serve as Disaster Information Specialists to help meet their communities' information needs in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from disasters and public health emergencies. Several pilot projects were conducted by a variety of institutions including the Sarasota Memorial Hospital, New York University, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, HHS, in conjunction with the NIH Library. In March 2011, DIMRC hosted a Disaster Information Outreach Symposium to explore various ways in which librarians can assist their institutions, organizations, and communities.
<p>DIMRC also develops disaster and emergency information resources for health professionals and the public. (http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov). These tools include access to the relevant biomedical literature via PubMed (http://pubmed.gov) and the non-commercial literature via the Resource Guide for Disaster Medicine and Public Health (http://disasterlit.nlm.nih.gov), as well as tools to assist in the response to hazmat and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) events These tools include the Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders (WISER; http://wiser.nlm.nih.gov) with information on over 400 chemical, biological, and radiological agents, Radiation Emergency Medical Management (REMM; http://remm.nlm.gov) and Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management (CHEMM; http://chemm.nlm.nih.gov).</p>
<p>NLM, as part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), recognizes that it is critical to establish relationships with organizations that encourage and foster communication and information access. All those working in disaster medicine and public health need fast and easy access to the most up-to-date and accurate health information to effectively prepare for and respond to incidents. Evidence-based information from past events, incoming information from social media sources, and tools to aid in analysis are needed by health departments, hospitals, academic institutions, emergency management agencies, and non-governmental organizations to assist with disaster planning, as well as for response and recovery. Libraries and librarians are highly qualified to assist with these information needs.</p>
<p>Based on our pilot disaster information studies at several institutions since 2008 and the Disaster Information Outreach Symposium in March 2011, NLM funded for the first time in 2011 the Disaster Health Information Outreach and Collaboration Project for libraries and other organizations to work together to improve awareness of, access to, and use of disaster medicine and public health information by organizations, institutions, and agencies working in any phase of disaster/emergency management (all-hazards). (http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/2011disasteroutreachawards.html) NLM defines "disaster health information" broadly as clinical, public health, medical, and health information needed for preparedness, response and recovery from all-hazards disasters and emergencies, including public health emergencies. "All-hazards" includes natural events, terrorism, industrial accidents, transportation accidents, public health emergencies such as major disease outbreaks, chemical/biological/radiation/nuclear events with potential for causing mass casualties, and other incidents that require emergency response or have the potential to exceed local response resources.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives<br /></strong>The purpose of the Disaster Health Information Outreach and Collaboration Project is to design programs for improving disaster medicine and public health information access for health professionals, first responders and others (paid or volunteer) that play a role in health-related disaster preparedness, response and recovery. (See the section below on Target Audiences.) Emphasis is on providing information or access to health and medical information in a way useful to the target audiences, and increasing the awareness and utilization of high-quality, professional-level online medical and public health information resources on disaster, all-hazards, and emergency topics including resources from the National Library of Medicine listed in the Background Information above. The purpose is also to promote new and creative collaborations on disaster health information needs among and to the mutual benefit of librarians, information specialists, or informationists and the disaster workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements</strong> <br /><br />Projects must involve one <br />or more of the following information access categories:<br /><br />1. Needs Assessment: To determine and evaluate disaster health information needs, available resources, training needs, preferred information access tools, gaps in types or content of materials, and other aspects of the provision of information services by and for librarians and the disaster workforce.</p>
<p>2. Roles in Providing Disaster Health Information: To develop new or expanded roles for librarians/informationists with organizations that have major disaster health-related responsibilities and/or to develop new or expanded roles for disaster workforce members' participation in development, evaluation, promotion and use of health information resources. To promote cross-training and mutual awareness of each organization's disaster roles and health information needs.</p>
<p>3. Practices and Methods in Information Sharing: To develop collaborative information practices, methods, and communication tools among information organizations (libraries or similar) and disaster organizations for sharing of health information to enhance disaster planning, situational awareness, response, and recovery. Practices and tools could address, for example, building community resilience, online mapping of post-disaster resources, use of social media in disasters, biosurveillance, and other means for enhancing communications. Projects may also support the health information needs of an institution developing continuity of operations plans or disaster response plans, but funds will not be provided for actually doing that planning.</p>
<p>4. Skills Development: Training to develop skills in accessing or using disaster health-related information including the use of online databases and general disaster information resources in order to improve services, benefits the community, and enhance understanding of the context for using disaster information. This may include training for the staff of an agency, development of training programs for clients and patrons, training programs for other agencies, etc.</p>
<p>5. Information Retrieval: To provide or improve access to electronic disaster medicine and public health information resources for organizations with disaster-related responsibilities or by the clients they serve and to implement access to state-of-the-art disaster health-related information tools via the Internet or mobile devices. This may require the purchase of hardware (computer equipment), software, or contractual relationships necessary to obtain a connection to the Internet for the benefit of organizations with disaster responsibilities and for the purpose of accessing and sharing disaster health-related information.</p>
<p>6. Document Access: Access to disaster health-related documents and other types of health information. This may include the enhancement of library collections, development of connections between disaster-related organizations and local health sciences or other libraries to obtain use of their collections, to procure interlibrary loan services, etc.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance<br />It is anticipated that the period of performance shall be for twelve (12) months from the date of award. Awards are anticipated to be made in September of 2012.<br /><br /><strong>Other Important Considerations<br /><br /></strong>The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR 12 .

Description:

The Naval Surface Warfare Center  Indian Head Division (NSWC IHD) is conducting a market survey through this Sources Sought to identify potential sources, within the National Technical Industrial Base (NTIB), capable of manufacturing MK187 5/54 High Explosive (HE) Projectiles for a systems acquisition.  The manufacture of these projectiles includes procurement or manufacture of all components and Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) to provide an all up round (AUR).
  The MK187 employs the MK419 Multi-Function Fuze (MFF) attached to the MK64 projectile body.  The MFF (MK 419) has five (5) selectable operational modes [(1) provides air proximity (AIR); (2) surface proximity (HOB); (3) autonomous (AUTO); (4) point detonating (PD) and (5) electric time (ET] and is inductively set by an electronic fuze setter.  The MK64 projectile body is a conventional AISI 1050 grade steel body loaded with PBXN-9 explosive.  It includes a copper rotating band for spin and obturation and a 1/2 caliber boat tail at the base of the projectile.  The overall AUR length is approximately 26 inches, with a weight of 70 pounds.  The MK 187 AUR also contains LIDs, Adapters, MK4 Mod 0 Fuze protector cap, and ~ 10 lbs of PBX -9 (to be Government furnished)

Sources should be capable of supplying the entire quantity of MK187 HE Projectiles through a Best Value, systems acquisition under a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, over five (5) years from FY13 through FY17.

The following yearly MK187 quantity requirements are subject to change:

FY13  12,362
FY14  0
FY15  4,144
FY16  6,912
FY17  11,088

In conjunction with the systems acquisition of the MK187, NSWC IHD is also interested in the manufacture of the following two components to support additional Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and In-Service requirements:  1) MK437 Multi-Option Fuze Navy (MOFN); and 2) MK64 projectile bodies loaded with the PBXN-9 explosives (MK 187 AUR less MFF fuze).

<DESC>The VA Healthcare System intends to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements with Angiodynamics for Starburst Talon Semiflex Electrodes and pads. This requirement will include the following characteristics: 
Product Description
Product # 700-102845 Starburst Talon Semiflex Electrode-  Qty 5 each
Product # 700-102649 Thermo Dispersive Electrode Pad (set of 2)-  Qty 5 ea

Salient Characteristics
The StarBurst Talon Semi-Flex RFA electrode is a versatile device that features both rigid (metal) and flexible (polymer) trocar sections. The device offers all the benefits of the StarBurst Talon RFA electrode, but also has the ability to bend up to 90 degrees in all directions allowing for easy entry into the CT gantry. The active tip is also visible under CT imaging for precise placement.
Features
"	Fast 4 cm spherical ablation in an average of 11 minutes using Innovative Infusion-Based RFA which overcomes the limitations of traditional dry electrodes 
"	Surgically tapered cutting tip to penetrate and anchor soft tissue tumors 
"	Single device placement for surface or difficult-to-reach lesions 
"	Proprietary, real-time temperature feedback from all four electrode tines ensures controlled ablations and predictable outcomes 

New temperature monitoring thermo pads help the physician monitor the temperature of the return pad site during the ablation process. AngioDynamics' pads feature continuous temperature monitoring at the pad adhesion site through the incorporation of a thermocouple device located at the pad leading edge. The pads are designed to meet the needs of clinicians using AngioDynamics' latest generation of high-power, infusion based radiofrequency electrodes. The thermocouple returns data automatically to the 1500X RF generator, monitoring pad temperature throughout the procedure, and shutting off power when unsafe pad temperatures are detected. Thermo pads will work with any existing 1500X System.



This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest, accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than May 23, 2012 4PM EST. Responses should be sent to Kolleen.Blanton@va.gov. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>Description: <br />This is a request for information (RFI) issued by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) for information and planning purposes only. No award will be made from the responses to this announcement. However, responses may be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a future acquisition.
<p>This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of NRL to acquire any product or services. The NRL does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested. Submission of a response to this RFI is voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the NRL to pay or entitle the submitter to any compensation. All information and data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be protected as such.</p>
<p>Corrosion related surface preparation and repair on Navy ships is a time consuming and mundane task for many sailors. Typically, this work is accomplished using archaic mechanical tools (e.g., needle guns, chipping hammers and metal grinders) to remove areas of coatings, rust and salt with the goal of generating a clean and corrosion free metal surface; poor or improper surface preparation has been noted by the corrosion technical community (e.g., National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) and Steel Structure Protective Coatings (SSPC) as the major cause for premature coating failure.</p>
<p>To advance the current state of surface preparation technologies for Ship's Force, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) seeks to identify, and to assess the maturity and applicability, of non-traditional surface preparation technologies with focus on cleaning efficiency and reduction in preparation time, as well determining if the technology imparts any or proper surface profile (2-3 mils). These technologies can range from methods of coating removal using microwaves, lasers, heat induction (focused heat), and ultrasound, which can all be categorized as "working waves", in lieu of current mechanical methods used by Sailor's on the deckplate noted above, or more industrial shipyard processes (e.g., high pressure water and abrasive blasting</p>
<p>The primary objective would be to stress technology that can be made portable (backpack wearable or on wheels) and easy for sailors to operate, with all units utilizing a handheld coating removal / surface preparation device and, where feasible, may incorporate a protective vacuum cone or shroud for both collection of hazardous waste and isolation of particles from contact with sailors and ship systems. Technologies do not have to be presently at such a readiness level for shipboard implementation but have an identifiable realistic path.<br />Submissions</p>
<p>The Navy requests that information be provided by the response date indicated above. Information should be provided via e-mail only please in either Microsoft Word or .pdf format. The primary point of contact is Mr. Reese Van Wyen, contract specialist, at reese.vanwyen@nrl.navy.mil. Secondary points of contact are Mr. John Wegand, john.wegand@nrl.navy.mil and Dr. Virginia DeGiorgi, virginia.degiorgi@nrl.navy.mil. No phone calls please.

<SOLNBR>APHIS-SN-CARPOL-NoCostModel-002
<RESPDATE>061412
<CONTACT>Estela M. Diaz, Email CARPOL@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for No-Cost Contracts
<p>Sources Sought: Seeking information regarding a possible no-cost model contract for the delivery of certification, accreditation, registration, permitting, and other licensing (CARPOL) activities to the public.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Marketing and Regulatory Programs Business Services (MRPBS) is considering the possibility of entering into a no-cost contract to deliver CARPOL-related services to the public. The agency is contemplating reducing the cost of maintaining existing systems by shifting the delivery of CARPOL services to industry.</p>
<p>The vendor would be required to comply with Federal security requirements, remain in compliance with all requirements regarding access to personally identifiable information (PII), and meet certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) requirements under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). The vendor would also be required to consider APHIS mission-related requirements governed by applicable appropriations, authorizing legislations, and other Federal laws under which the agency is required to operate.</p>
<p>No-cost contracts are not subject to either the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) or the Agriculture Acquisition Regulations (AGAR). The terms and conditions for a no-cost contract will be negotiated in accordance with FAR Part 12 (Commercial Contracts) to protect the rights of both parties. A no-cost contract does not violate the Anti-deficiency Act because the Government would not incur financial liability for any CARPOL-related services provided by the vendor. APHIS would apply statutory requirements under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) for procurements by Federal agencies (property or services) applicable to civilian agencies (41 U.S.C. &sect; 253).</p>
<p>Agency Background Information:<br />APHIS is organizationally located under USDA Marketing and Regulatory Programs (MRP). MRP's mission is to facilitate domestic and international marketing of U.S. agricultural products and ensure the health and wellbeing of animals and plants. The overarching goals of the USDA MRP agencies are:</p>
<p>&bull;Faster delivery of services and products<br />&bull;Improved customer relations<br />&bull;Incorporation of efficiency and innovation to streamline operational solutions<br />&bull;Perpetuation of effective change management</p>
<p>APHIS' mission is threefold: (1) provide leadership in ensuring the health and wellbeing of animals and plants, (2) improve agricultural productivity and competitiveness, and (3) contribute to the national economy and public health. In supporting USDA's mission to protect American agriculture and natural resources, APHIS issues CARPOL authorizations of various forms to allow the movement of specifically regulated agricultural commodities into and through the United States.</p>
<p>APHIS currently provides a Web-based system for users to apply for permits, check the status of their permit applications, and view issued permits. The system is integrated with the U.S. Department of Treasury www.pay.gov site to process payments of any fees. Federal import permitting officials use the APHIS system workflow capabilities to review the applications and issue permits.</p>
<p>In addition, Federal and State enforcement officials use the APHIS system to verify the validity of import permits. The system users include APHIS import permitting officials; other Federal Government employees; State agriculture officials; and private individuals, universities, and businesses. The system exchanges data with separate systems utilized by other Federal Government agencies that are also involved in the inspection and movement of imported commodities under APHIS' regulatory authority. These other agencies include the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>Internally, Plant Inspection Stations and Investigative and Enforcement Services staff use the system to validate permits and exchange data with several IT systems. In addition to the current Web-based system, APHIS has other CARPOL processes that interact with the import permitting process as well as other electronic sources of structured CARPOL data. The USDA and its cooperators issue approximately 550,000 permit-type certificates per year.</p>
<p>APHIS' primary goal is to have one flexible, expandable system that will fulfill its common data needs for CARPOL services and that optimizes user productivity, maximizes data value, and is compliant with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations, and directives.</p>
<p>APHIS seeks to expand and improve its sharing, reporting, and analytical capabilities of CARPOL data and business processes. The foundation of a replacement system or service will be improved business processes identified in a business process assessment and reengineering final product produced by APHIS. An additional goal is to leverage, where possible, current technology and other resources.</p>
<p>All interested sources in the market <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WITH or WITHOUT</span></em></strong> experience in no-cost model contracts, are encouraged to provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Name of source (company/organization) including point of contact to include name, address, telephone number, and email. Include business status (small, large, or other).</p>
<p>2. Corporate or organization technical capabilities.</p>
<p>3. References for three contracts (Government, commercial, or other) within the past 3 years for similar CARPOL-related systems or services (not necessarily under a no-cost model).</p>
<p>4. Approximate net worth of company capitol for assessment of financial strength.</p>
<p>5. If referenced source is under a no-cost model, please provide contact information for at least three applications under this contracting model that you have provided to customers (at least one Government customer) to include:</p>
<p>a. Name of entity and customer contact information. <br />b. Include data when application was created and how long operated.<br />c. Explain how the no-cost model works in referenced source.<br />d. How are costs recovered (i.e., what is the third-party pricing structure)?</p>
<p>Sources responding to this posting are responsible for appropriately marking any information that is proprietary in nature. This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). Therefore, no proposals will be accepted. No contracts will result from any submission. The Government will not award a contract based on the information received; nor will we reimburse participants for information provided. Information requested is strictly voluntary and is for informational purposes only.</p>
<p>Responses must be emailed to CARPOL@aphis.usda.gov and include the phrase <strong>"CARPOL Solutions No-Cost Model"</strong> in the subject line. No telephone communication will be accepted.</p>
<p>Sources responding to this notice will not be entitled to the results.</p>

<DESC>KAN EVANSVILLE TRIBAL COUNCIL NUMBER: 	PR: 0040037373 POSTED DATE: 	05/16/2012 SUBJECT:	Continuation services of Heavy equipment with operator, gravel delivery and spreading, septic pumping, and solid waste disposal services. Facilities located in Betles Field, AK This announcement constitutes the only notice. This is not a request for quotes. A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Responses must be received no later than Monday 21, 2012 by sending an e-mail to almeda_gaddis@fws.gov; however, any technical data received will be for the sole purpose of market research for future requirements.

ON:	05/22/2012 NAICS:	562212	Solid Waste Landfill AUTHORITY:	8.405-6(a)(2) Limited Sources Justification and Approval 13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because: Heavy equipment with operator, gravel delivery and spreading, septic pumping, and solid waste disposal services, The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge maintains several buildings at their field station in Bettles, AK. Frequently gravel is needed to maintain, improve, create, or expand, the surface surrounding these buildings for the purposes of parking, storage, and fill. In addition, septic pumping and solid waste disposal services are regularly needed to maintain these facilities. The Service does not own the heavy equipment needed to obtain, haul, and deliver gravel to their facilities, or to-pump haul and dispose of waste, so we need to contract for these services. A base year with four options periods with an anticipated award date of 05/22/2012.

<DESC>This announcement acts as notice of the National Park Services' (NPS) intent to enter into a sole source purchase order with the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental Science for certain water analysis services. Assateague Island National Seashore (ASIS) intends to enter into a base year contract, along with two following option years, for services necessary to analyze monthly water samples from 18 permanent monitoring stations within ASIS. Horn Point Laboratory within the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) is the most efficient, certified laboratory for the analytical evaluation of estuarine water quality samples in the immediate area of ASIS.  Other qualified laboratories are further away, thus drastically increasing the chances of sample contamination during transportation. Furthermore, ASIS has used has utilized UMCES services from the inception of water testing program in 1987, thus maintaining a continuity of methodology paramount for the results of the study and its partners (eg. USGS, EPA, Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Maryland Coastal Bays Program, and the University of Maryland).  For the aforementioned reasons, ASIS intends to enter into a sole source contract with UMCES for the water analysis services for fiscal year 2012, and for two additional option years, without full and open competition. Vendors having questions regarding this procurement, or disputing the conclusions specified herein, should contact Jason Pratt, Contract Specialist- Central MABO NPS, at 215-597-647. INQUIRIES MUST BE RECEIVED PRIOR TO MAY 23, 2012 BEFORE 2 PM. Any requests for copies of solicitations will not be addressed since this is a notice of intent to enter into a sole source procurement, not a request for quote.

<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>

<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>

<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations.

Historical workload indicates that Fort Hunter Liggett requires sampling on a weekly basis (with a couple unscheduled visits based upon the less predictable sampling requirements unique to the installation).<br><br>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Fort Sam Houston, Environmental Contracting Division intends to award one or more BPA(s) resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.<br><br>The following are the two source selection subfactors prospective offerors should address:<br><br>Technical Subfactor 01: <br><br>Brief discussion of associated duties, challenges and solutions.

<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State's (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs' (INL) mission is to minimize the impact of international crime and illegal drugs on the United States and its citizens by providing effective foreign assistance and through fostering global cooperation. INL's Office of Western Hemisphere Programs (INL/WHP) develops narcotics control and anticrime policy initiatives for countries in the Western Hemisphere that produce and transit narcotics.

The PNC of Guatemala consists of approximately 24,000 sworn officers and the Government of Guatemala (GOG) plans to increase their total number of officers to 34,000 over the next four years. The PNC is plagued with widespread corruption, their pay is low, and often times working conditions are less than adequate. Additionally, they are poorly trained and lack basic resources such as vehicles, radios, which makes it a very challenging environment to implement programs and teach new concepts.</p>

<p>d. Coordinate the development and implementation of the program's philosophy and objectives with the PNC, PRC, international donors, and PNC Academy.</p>
<p>e. Create a clearly written operational and prevention plan in coordination with the PNC and PRC that is consistent with existing laws, regulations, and protocols which identifies the mission and objectives of the investigative strategies to meet the demands of Guatemala.</p>
<p>f. Coordinate with the PNC Academy in developing training for PNC personnel. Courses should be specifically designed for each supervisory level and officers assigned to prevention/operations as well as cadets. The courses should include techniques for developing prevention strategies using the programs philosophy and crime statistics.</p>
<p>g. Develop awareness of the ComStat process for identification of crime "hotspots," personnel needs, material needs and strategic planning.</p>
<p>h. Coordinate training to all those assigned to the project area with a focus on goals and objectives of preventive policing and include refresher training in ethics, professionalism, and information/intelligence gathering.</p>
<p>i. Implement Initial Incident Reporting and the Total Information Management System for the management and documentation of all information regarding all interventions by the police.</p>
<p>j. Work closely with the Public Ministry to develop a well-defined PNC/Prosecutor relationship and to define areas of responsibility for all who work in the prevention and operational process.</p>
<p>k. Provide advice and assistance in planning, developing, and administering a national citizen security strategy.</p>
<p>l. Assist the U.S. Embassy in its overall goal to strengthen and institutionalize the capabilities of Guatemalan law enforcement entities and justice sector personnel, while also ensuring that USG citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law interests are well served.</p>
<p>m. Evaluate and implement internal control measures to ensure conformance with the myriad of laws and regulations under which the NAS/INL programs are administered.</p>
<p>n. Continuously evaluate and advise U.S. Embassy officials on the performance of host nation agencies operating in conjunction with NAS/INL assets and resources in order to recommend and/or provide training as needed.</p>

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?	Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o	Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. 
HQ Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-5527 Facsimile Number:  (703) 806-8866 or 8875

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

[The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

The limits of work will start at levee mile 140/0+00 and extend approximately 3miles to levee mile 143/4+00 along the west (right) bank of the Mississippi River main line levee system.  The limits of work are highlighted on the enclosed aerial photo sheets. The subsurface exploration shall consist of soil borings located along the landside of the levee.  The Contractor shall perform all remaining borings for the project.  The government will locate all remaining borings with a wooden stake or survey flagging and provide the Contractor with approximate boring locations as marked on the aerial photo maps.  <br>The project is located along the west bank levee of the Mississippi River between levee miles 137/50+00 and 143/4+00 in an area known as Gammon, Arkansas.  Gammon is located west of Marion, Arkansas and north of West Memphis, Arkansas.  The Corp of Engineers completed a seepage study in 1994 and re-evaluated the area in 2005.  Water berms were constructed near levee mile 138/0+00 to 139/20+00 to lessen seepage.  During the recent historic flood of 2011 this area encountered extended areas of heavy seepage and numerous sand boils near the water berms and in concentrated areas along the levee for approximately 4 levee miles.  This study is an extension of the previous study and will encompass areas that exhibited extensive seepage and high energy sand boils.  Subsurface exploration as well as a comprehensive survey is required to complete the study for design recommendation which could include relief wells with adequate drainage, seepage berms and/or water berms.<br>All laboratory tests required will be performed at the Contractor's laboratory.  The Contractor's laboratory shall be located within a 30-mile radius of the Memphis District Office so that a Memphis District Geotechnical Engineer can easily drive to the lab in one day in order to view and assign tests to the samples recovered. The Contractor's laboratory shall conform to the requirements as specified in ASTM D 3740 and ASTM E 329 and shall be validated by the Materials Testing Center for the Corps of Engineers. A list of current validated testing laboratories can be viewed at: http://www.wes.army.mil/SL/MTC/mtc.htm. The soil tests for this contract will include wet sieve analyses.  An estimate of the number of tests to be performed is included in Table 2.  A project geotechnical engineer shall ensure that all required laboratory testing for this investigation be performed according to EM 1110-2-1906 (20 August 1986).  The government will assign laboratory tests based on the resulting field logs.  After testing of the material, the soil samples shall be placed in the original jars and all boring samples for the project shall be delivered to the Ensley Engineering Yard in Memphis, TN by June 22, 2012.<br>Basis for Award: This award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable (LPTA) offeror. Offeror shall have specialized experience and knowledge commensurate with the tasks specified in the Statement of Work. Contractors shall demonstrate technical capability by submitting documentation, as required by FAR 52.212-2 and stated in the attached section, "Evaluation Factors."

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>

<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Support Relief Group (SRG) - Logistics Specialist</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: GS-13 equivalent ($71,674 - 93,175 not eligible for locality pay).

The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension.

Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p><br />8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Logistics Unit is part of the Operations Division (OPS) of OFDA. The core function of the Logistics Unit is to manage and execute all phases of the direct delivery of non-food humanitarian assistance, including the acquisition of commodities, and facilitating and coordinating transport and logistics arrangements. In addition, this unit manages OFDA's worldwide stockpiles and maintains relationships with other governmental and non-governmental entities that are capable of supporting OFDA's execution of its humanitarian interventions.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity. In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field. The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations. SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>The SRG program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in OFDA/OPS. This team maintains a database for all contracted Support Relief Group staff and provides information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience. OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified SRG for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing SRG. Each SRG incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills. They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide. At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau. Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The Logistics Unit requires a SRG Logistics Specialist to strengthen its capacity to provide prompt, effective services in the areas of logistical management and support as needed. The SRG specialist will be required to work in the headquarters to backfill while permanent staff are in the field or be deployed to the field as part of DART or Assessment Team.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 001 TO THE	COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR 118 GHZ RADIOMETER SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer vendor questions. Accordingly: 1.  Do I understand it correctly those four 118 GHz mixers with high pass filter, IF amplifier and 2x multiplier are all that is requested? GSFC COTR: The vendor should propose the Local Oscillator and distribution as well, basically all of the components found in the functional block diagram  Figure 1 . (A.  Expected Configuration: PDRO/x2/Amp/Four-way Splitter connected to four x2/SHM with integrated IF amplifier) 2. Are radiometer antennas also a part of requested package? GSFC COTR: The antennas are a separate requirement. For HyMAS and include both 118 GHz and 183 GHz antennas. 3.  What is the volume available?  GSFC COTR: The volume would be cylindrical NTE 5 diameter and 8 in length on each signal chain. The 4 receivers connect to two antenna lens that define the diameter.  The length is defined by the drum diameter so the signal chains may have to curl to fit in our drum. 4. Your specification says there is approximately 8" in diameter and 9" long enclosure available, but it also says there are four other radiometers that share the volume. GSFC COTR: Thank you for noticing this inconsistency in our specification III. Requirements A.	Packaging   These two sentences should be corrected to read as follows: All Four receivers MUST be able to fit within an existing drum and share volume with the data system, power system and lens antennas. There are also two other radiometers that must share the same volume. 5. What are the restrictions on space? GSFC COTR: Figure 2 with the caption The delivered receivers will be packaged into a cylindrical enclosure like the one shown is the overall volume that must fit all instrument components. The volume dedicated to the 118 GHz front end components must be proportionally smaller. Figure 2 was given as an example of tight packing with connectorized components. 6.  Is all that is requested described in the paragraphs B, C, D, E, and F on pages 4 and 5? GSFC COTR: The request is for only the 118 GHz channels described in the statement of work. 7.  Is this RFQ for a small business set aside only, or could large business also respond to the RFQ? We are a corporation, large business size and are considering responding to it. Small Business set aside only. 8. If it remains a small business set aside, can large business be subcontractors?  NO 9. How to locate Questions and Answers from potential suppliers regarding this RFQ? Check the https://www.fbo.gov/ for amendments. 10. Is any additional information (technical or contractual) regarding this?  In particular, is a drawing or sketch showing the packaging or enclosure that the Items must fit into? Specifications are included in the statement of work, uploaded to the solicitation. 11. How to submit the Quotation and/or Proposal? Respond to the RFQ portion of the solicitation. 12. Any Forms or Certificates/Documents to fill out? NO The due date for receipt of offers is extended to May 20, 2012. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on May 3, 2012.

2.	Q.  We presume utilities consist of normal systems-water, fire water, waste water, storm drainage, natural gas, electric (primary and secondary), fiber optic, telephone, cooling water, high temperature water.  Are there any other type known utilities?

<DESC><p><strong>Description of Work:</strong> This is a solicitation for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) at Fairchild AFB WA. This acquisition will provide indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) and design-build (D-B) construction efforts at Fairchild AFB, Washington. The MATOC will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. The contractor shall provide all materials, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement/removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, and paving. Locations of work will be at Fairchild AFB WA and other associated sites outside the base proper. All off base sites are within 80 miles of Fairchild AFB. Work to be performed under the MATOC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $33.5M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $33.5M. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and one 12-month option period. Subsequent task orders will identify specific requirements for each project. Individual task orders may range from approximately $2,500 - $650,000. The program value to include all three contracts and subsequent task orders is Not-to-Exceed $7M over a 2-year period. This acquisition is an 8(a) set-aside.&nbsp; It has been determined that competition will be limited to 8(a) firms located within the geographical area of Region 10, and other 8(a) construction firms with a bona fide place of business within the Region 10 geographical competitive area, and the assigned NAICS code.&nbsp; All other 8(a) BD Participants are deemed ineligible to submit offers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference/site visit will be held per Section H, FAR 52.236-27 and Paragraph 1.3 as stated in the solicitation, to include a site visit for the seed project.All prospective offerors are highly encouraged to attend this conference. Offerors are encouraged to submit all questions and requests for clarifications no less than ten (10) days prior to the RFP closing date. The decision whether to respond to questions and requests for clarification made less than ten (10) days prior to the RFP closing shall be at the sole discretion of the contracting officer.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Each offeror's proposal will be evaluated utilizing best value source selection procedures. The basis for award is to be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) without technical factors. The procedures described in FAR Part 15.3, AFFAR 5315.3, Policy Memorandums 11-C-04 and 11-C-07 and source selection procedures will be utilized. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a seed project. The magnitude of the seed project is less than $25,000. The offeror's Past Performance will be considered approximately equal in importance to the Seed Project's Price. The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror possesses sufficient past performance experience for relevant construction projects that range from $50,000 to $500,000. Also, all offeror's shall show the capability of receiving $3M in bonding annually. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer deems discussions are in the Government's best interest. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority (SSA) shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision, considering price and past performance tradeoff, for award of the seed project. Additional MATOC contract awards will be determined based on the final rankings of the highest rated proposals from the SSA's integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p><strong>Award:</strong> The Government anticipates awarding up to three (3) Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. In addition, up to three (3) Fixed Price Task Orders to attend an orientation seminar will be awarded to meet the minimum contract guarantee resulting from this solicitation, not to exceed $2,500 and in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulation.

If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in cases when FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.



Disclaimer: This pre-solicitation notice is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts.

The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis.
 The Government will not reimburse the cost of any submission in response to this announcement -- the entire cost of any submission will be at the sole expense of the source submitting the information. If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FedBizOpps/NECO and interested parties must comply with that announcement. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. 



The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a solicitation in June 2012 for the MK 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) Canister Production Contract for (FY13-17) MK 14 Mod 2, MK 21 Mod 2, MK 21 Mod 3, and MK 25 Mod 0 canisters, ancillary hardware, and associated support equipment in support of US Navy requirements and NATO SEASPARROW consortium requirements.

NAVSEA intends to conduct an industry day on 4 June 2012 at NSWC PHD, Port Hueneme, CA.



The Canisters are utilized in the MK 41 Vertical Launching System.
 The Canisters serve as missile shipping containers (when configured with the Packaging, Handling, Storage and Transportation (PHSandT) equipment) and launch tubes (when loaded into VLS Modules). The Canisters provide missile environmental protection, structural support, hazard monitoring and rocket motor exhaust gas containment. 



The MK 14 Mod 2 Canister is the shipping container and provides structural alignment for the TOMAHAWK All Up Round. The Canister shell structure is a steel weldment with corrugated steel skins and cast steel end frames.

The Canister contains adjustable lateral restraint shoes, longitudinal shock isolators, an ablative coated steel baseplate structure, ablative blocks, deluge piping, nitrogen fill piping, cables, a code plug and a Canister Safe and Enable Switch.
 The Canister also contains a telemetry antenna and monitoring connection.



The MK 21 Mod 2 Canister is the shipping container and launch tube for SM 3 Block I/IA/IB missiles. The shell structure is a steel weldment utilizing flat plates stiffened with channels and cast steel end frames. The Canister contains booster cradles and guides, shock isolated dorsal fin guide rails, longitudinal shock isolators, an ablative coated steel baseplate structure, ablative lining, deluge piping, cables, a code plug, explosive release bolts and a Canister Safe and Enable Switch.

The Canister also contains a fiber optic connector and cable, telemetry antennas and a monitoring connection.



The MK 21 Mod 3 Canister is the shipping container and launch tube for SM 6 missiles.
 This Canister is similar to the MK 21 Mod 2 Canister with some minor differences.



The MK 25 Mod 0 Canister is the shipping container and launch tube for EVOLVED SEASPARROW Missiles (ESSM). The Canister consists of four sub cells, a dog down box, a forward support frame, a Canister frame, a Canister Electrical Module (CEM), cables, explosive release bolts and deluge piping. The Dog down box contains four sub cell base assemblies, four aft-support grids and a Printed Wiring Assembly (PWA). Each sub cell base includes longitudinal shock isolators, a longitudinal restraint clamp, a longitudinal restraint monitor, an obturator tube and a missile umbilical connector.

The CEM includes a PWA, Canister Safe/Enable Switch and Canister umbilical connector.
 The PWA in the CEM and Dog down box contain relays and other circuitry to allow the launcher to direct signals to any of the four sub cells. Each sub cell includes guide rails, upper lateral and lower lateral missile restraints and guide rails. The Canister also contains telemetry antennas and a monitoring connection.



NAVSEA intends to award one Firm Fixed Price contract via full and open competition. Requirements include, but are not limited to, production of canisters, as well as design, fabrication and/or procurement and assembly of all special tooling, test equipment and gauges required to manufacture, assemble, test and inspect MK 41 VLS Canisters, ancillary hardware, and associated support equipment.

Additionally, the Offeror will be required to fabricate or procure, maintain and calibrate the Canister Internal Fit Check Tool(s) that perform the Canister internal fit checks required by each Canister Parameters Document.
 The anticipated contract period of performance for this requirement will be from the date of contract award, approximately May 2013, through delivery of all hardware. 



The solicitation will be issued electronically via http://www.neco.navy.mil. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided or mailed. Interested offerors should monitor both the FBO page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the NECO site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil for the release of the solicitation.

Since this solicitation, and any applicable amendments, will be issued electronically, the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidders mailing list. 



IMPORTANT: In order to be considered for contract award, all offerors must be a United States (US) company or an independent US subsidiary.
 However, subject to the applicable laws, regulations, and the terms of the solicitation, foreign contractors may act as subcontractors to U.S. prime contractors. The export of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data is subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. 



Potential offerors are advised that the solicitation attachments contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C., App.

2401 et seq. Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. Disseminate in accordance with provisions of DoD Directive 5230.25.
 If a solicitation is posted, these documents will be supplied on a CD/DVD which will be mailed separately upon request. Only one copy of the controlled unclassified information CD/DVD will be distributed per interested company.

<DESC>Description:
<p>Sources Sought Notices (herein referred to as a Request for Information) are issued by the Department of State when performing market research to determine industry interest and capabilities. The Department of State is interested in the capabilities of both&nbsp;small and other than small businesses&nbsp;to perform the worldwide services. This is a Request for Information announcement only.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation or request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on the submission of this Request for Information nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>The Department of State reserves the right to terminate this request and change its requirements if needed. Responding to this Request for Information does not guarantee participation in future Department activities.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Department of State's, Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM), Global Information Technology (IT) Modernization (GITM) program provides classified and unclassified desktop and server information technology equipment worldwide to approximately 270 sites abroad and 31 domestic bureaus and offices, under a centrally managed program designed to support the Department's evolving business processes, and modernization of the IT infrastructure using a four year life-cycle (Note: GITM Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) monitors are on a six year modernization life cycle.)</p>
<p><br />This request for information falls under IRM's multi-pronged Vanguard acquisition strategy, which focuses on acquiring and aligning contractual IT services to the Department of State's evolving enterprise service delivery model. Under Vanguard, IRM will consolidate and replace a large number of task orders and contracts with fewer and better-aligned performance-based acquisitions that integrate functions and processes and deliver improved services and cost efficiencies. The Vanguard task orders will be/are linked by Associate Contractor Agreements that commit the respective awardees to work together in support of Department service, efficiency, and IT security objectives. Vanguard 2.2.3 is the Department's hardware supply chain and logistics management task order for the worldwide IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>GITM is seeking to determine industry interest and the capabilities of sources available to satisfy a requirement to expand the array of modernized IT equipment deployed by the GITM program, focusing on comprehensive supply chain management solutions (purchase, receive and integrate, deploy, install, and repair and return) as well as cabling infrastructure modernization for existing overseas locations. This Request for Information and the Vanguard 2.2.3 excludes design and engineering support services.</p>
<p>Program Objectives:</p>
<p>The overall objective is to acquire a supply chain management solution that will leverage industry standards and best practices to increase efficiency, optimize effectiveness, and establish common processes for managing IT supply chains across the enterprise. The ability to maximize operational capabilities and minimize lifecycle costs are fundamental goals.</p>
<p>Other specific objectives for the expanded GITM program include:</p>
<p>a. Rationalize and consolidate disparate equipment life-cycles in order to reduce cost of supply chain activities and decrease time from procurement to installation.</p>
<p>b. Establish common supply chain management processes for managing an array of IT equipment to be installed globally using a process driven business model in order to improve service delivery:</p>
<p>1. Purchase - provide procurement support under the direction of the government to include requirements forecasting, determination and tracking, and coordinating procurement execution and procurement award.</p>
<p>2. Receive and Integrate - receipt of equipment, warehousing, material management, quality control and integration. Ability to support warehouse operations in the Washington, DC metro area is required.</p>
<p><br />3. Deploy - provide logistical services to deploy equipment using best delivery options within DoS guidelines; management deployment of personnel to DoS sites for installation.</p>
<p>4. Install - provide installation services on a global basis to install systems and related services.</p>
<p>5. Repair and Return - support receipt, repair and return of defective or failed equipment.</p>
<p>Innovation and Department of State Intent:</p>
<p>Industry should demonstrate its capability to provide:</p>
<p>a. Innovations in the area of providing an integrated view of information driving both supply chain activities (including cost/service trade-offs), and the equipment life-cycle of the installed base.</p>
<p>b. Innovative solutions in the area of remote installations wherein the contractor provides a US based technical team responsible for system installation assistance/guidance to government IT staff located at an overseas post performing the physical installation of systems.</p>
<p>c. Innovative solutions in the area of design and installation of modernized cabling infrastructure (data, voice, video) at overseas posts with the goal of providing complete and reliable cabling.</p>
<p>d. Innovations in the area of performance based metrics to include suggested different metrics for deploying to countries/regions based on the level of infrastructure development, i.e., metrics for deployments to less developed regions of the world differ from metrics for more developed regions of the world.</p>
<p>e. The deployment methodology for workstations may change overtime to include direct shipment of overseas, unclassified workstations from the workstation vendor's location to overseas locations.</p>
<p>f. The level of effort for this work may change overtime due to the impact of virtual desktop deployment; a technology GITM will pursue.</p>
<p>g. Collaboration with others across the Department of State vendor community is required to accomplish the objectives including building supply chain activities on engineering and design requirements under Vanguard 2.2.1 Task Order focused on engineering, designing, securing, operating and maintaining the Department's critical enterprise-wide IT network infrastructure. Innovative ideas on transition activities to a comprehensive supply chain process model that will minimize disruption to current activities are sought. Note: Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), McLean, VA is the Vanguard 2.2.1 contractor.</p>
<p>Additional Background related to Requirements:</p>
