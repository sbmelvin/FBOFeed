The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal.  Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA.  Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A proposal's technical evaluation and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 28 February 2013.  This BAA will remain open continuously through 31 March 2013. The BAA technical areas of interest are divided into the following groups:  1. Combat Feeding Equipment and Systems (objectives focus on combat food service equipment for individual and group feeding, and unit/organization equipment); 2.

If the solicitation is released, it will be released through this FedBizOpps website on or after April 18, 2011. The Forest Service reserves the right not to release a solicitation. This notice meets the requirements of FAR 5.201.
<p>NOTE REGARDING FEDBIZOPPS LISTINGS. <br />The FedBizOpps website has three separate listings for the Forest Service in Alaska. These are (1) R-10 Alaska Region, Juneau, AK; (2) R-10 Chugach National Forest, Anchorage, AK; and (3) R-10 Tongass National Forest, Ketchikan, AK. Prospective bidders are advised that these three listings are not purely geographic and that a requirement on either the Chugach (Anchorage) or Tongass (Ketchikan) National Forest may be posted under the Regional Office (Juneau) listing. Thus, prospective bidders seeking Forest Service opportunities in Alaska should visit both the appropriate Forest listing (Anchorage or Ketchikan) as well as the Regional listing (Juneau). The solicitation contemplated by this notice will appear under the Ketchikan listing.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION. <br />The purpose and intent of this contract is to secure services for pre-commercial thinning of approximately 977 acres of conifer reproduction, approximately 21 to 31 years old. The Contractor must furnish all labor, equipment, housing, subsistence, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals except those items listed as Government-furnished property.</p>
<p>PROJECT LOCATION. <br />All items are on north Prince of Wales Island, in the Red Bay area, along Forest Roads 20, 2083, 2079010, 2079310, 2000805, 2083100, 2000840, and 2000850. Prince of Wales Island is part of the Thorne Bay and Craig Ranger Districts, Tongass National Forest, Alaska. The project is approximately 54 air miles northwest of Thorne Bay.</p>
<p>Ketchikan is accessible via Alaska Airlines and the Alaska Marine Highway System. Commercial floatplane services, based in Ketchikan, fly passengers and freight to communities and logging camps located on Prince of Wales Island. The Inter-Island Ferry system provides vehicle and passenger service between the Hollis ferry terminal on Prince of Wales Island and Ketchikan. A paved/gravel road system connects Hollis to most communities and logging camps located on Prince of Wales Island. During the winter months, only the roads connecting the communities of Hollis, Craig/Klawock, and Thorne Bay are maintained and passable. Barge lines in Seattle, Washington transport materials and equipment to Thorne Bay, Craig and Ketchikan.</p>
<p>Because of the uniqueness of Southeast Alaska regarding access, logistics, and service points, it is strongly recommended that prospective Contractors adequately familiarize themselves with the area to help determine mobilization costs, living, and travel expenses.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION DETAILS. <br />The following preliminary details are subject to change in the actual solicitation. Contract type: firm-fixed-price. Period of performance: 140 days. Solicitation type: Request for Proposal.</p>

<DESC>THIS PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. This pre-solicitation notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 emphasizes the need for the United States to move toward electronic health records. The legislation requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in part, to establish a Health Information Technology Testing Infrastructure (HITTI) that supports effective industry consensus standards development processes and provides the United States healthcare information technology (HIT) industry and federal activities with robust conformance and interoperability testing capabilities.</p>
<p>NIST is responsible for leading the development of the core HITTI that will provide a scalable, multi-partner, automated, remote capability for current and future testing needs. Initial emphasis will be on testing the standards addressing high national healthcare priorities (e.g., as identified and/or defined in concept of Electronic Health Record (EHR) technology "meaningful use"). NIST will work with standards and specification development organizations and other stakeholders to ensure appropriate feedback mechanisms exist for updating the standards.</p>
<p>The objective of the HITTI Project is to harmonize the efforts of healthcare standards test development and delivery to meet the demands for conformance and interoperability within the healthcare domain. This will be accomplished by working in collaboration with health IT stakeholders such as vendors, implementers, standards organizations, and certification bodies to establish a testing infrastructure that will:<br />-Provide a variety of conformance and interoperability testing services;<br />-Support a broad range of test environments;<br />-Support numerous health data exchange standards;<br />-Provide a component-based user interface;<br />-Enable user customization;<br />-Support changing user requirements; and<br />-Provide a feedback loop to enhance the health standards.</p>
<p>The following items are not within scope and shall not be considered part of the HITTI:<br />-Developing standards; <br />-Performing certifications;<br />-Conducting operational testing.<br /><br />The NAICS code for this requirement is 541511 with a small business size standard of $25.0 million. Contracting by Negotiation shall be utilized under the authority of FAR Part 15. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business. A time and materials contract is anticipated.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-11-RP-0039.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation. The Government will not maintain a mailing list.</p>
<p>Any communication regarding this requirement must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>Offerors shall be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration website at www.ccr.gov, in order to be eligible to receive a contract under this solicitation.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately 15<br />days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT), to negotiate/award a purchase order to PerkinElmer Health Sciences, 710 Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, CT 06484 for maintenance and service on ten Envision Multi-Label Readers.<br /><br />The mission of the NCGC is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. <br /><br />This request is for a service contract encompassing 10 PerkinElmer Envision instruments within the NIH Center for Translation Therapeutics (NCTT). The PerkinElmer Envision is a multi-label plate reader capable of reading luminescence, fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, and time-resolved fluorescence. These readers are an integral part of the screening operations conducted at NCTT. As such, these readers must remain in nearly constant operation and must be properly tuned for the generation of reliable data. Without proper maintenance, the readers could generate misleading and unreliable data, unbeknownst to the operator. Proper maintenance will also help to prevent instrument failure and avert the loss of expensive, ongoing assays. This service contract will provide one preventative maintenance visit for each instrument and cover the costs (parts, travel, and labor) of any necessary repair. These services will ensure reliable data and hasten repair in the event of instrument failure. Importantly, PerkinElmer is the only provider of this mission critical service and they do not authorize any other parties to service their instruments.<br /><br />This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334516 and the Size Standard is 500 Employees. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-157-RSF may be submitted by mail to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6151, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Rashida Ferebee, by fax transmission to (301) 480-3345 or by email to ferebeers@nhlbi.nih.gov. Interested parties responding to this announcement need to do so by 7:00am Eastern Standard Time on April 15, 2011.

<DESC>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), strives to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA-NIAID-DAIT-NIHAI2010093) entitled "Nonhuman Primate Major Histocompatibility Complex Gene Discovery and Typing Technology Development".<br /><br />NHPs approximate the human in physiology, immunology, and genetics more closely than other animals and, therefore, are often the preferred models to: 1) evaluate the safety and efficacy of candidate vaccines against human pathogens; 2) develop and evaluate immune-based therapeutic strategies to prevent graft rejection and graft versus host disease in cell and organ transplantation; and 3) study the pathogenesis of, and evaluate novel immune-based therapies for infectious and immune-mediated disease. To support these continuing research efforts the NIAID announces the re-competition of the NHP Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Gene Discovery and Typing Technology Development Program. The objectives of this program are to facilitate and enhance the immunological research conducted with this important model by providing detailed knowledge of NHP MHC genes, loci and alleles through gene discovery and genomic characterization studies; and by developing and providing readily accessible means or methods to genotype individual research animals for the complete set of MHC alleles, or for select alleles, for the optimum design of experiments and genetic management of colonies.
<p>The most commonly used NHP species in immunological and infectious disease research are the Old World NHPs, including the cynomolgus or long-tailed macaque (Macaca fasicularis), the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), the baboon (multiple Papio species), sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys) and the pigtail macaque (Macaca nemestrina). For purposes of the background information of the NHP MHC below, NHP is used to denote the Old World monkey Macaca sp., unless where otherwise noted.</p>
<p>As in the human genome, the MHC region is the most polymorphic of the NHP genome, with a high degree of genetic diversity across the population. The MHC region includes MHC Class I and II genes, which encode cell surface proteins that serve a critical role in the adaptive immune response. NHP MHC Class I and II orthologs for the Old World macaques exist for most of the human MHC genes. However, a striking difference between the human and the rhesus macaque is that the NHP MHC Class I loci have undergone multiple duplication and expansion events resulting in a significantly greater number of expressed MHC Class I A and B genes per animal than in humans. In addition, the numbers of MHC Class I A and B loci can differ significantly between animals within a population. The NHP MHC Class II region also has been subject to more gene duplication and expansion than its human counterpart. Studies of other macaque species reveal similarly increased MHC genomic complexity over that of humans and great apes.</p>
<p>The NHP MHC Class I and II regions' genomic organization has had limited detailed characterization, with complete phased genomic sequencing of only two (2) haplotypes of a single rhesus. Due, in part, to the evidence of great variability in the numbers of loci between individual animals, knowledge of the genomic structure from multiple haplotypes and species of NHPs is needed to resolve the MHC organization and facilitate gene discovery efforts. Although progress has been made towards MHC Class I allele discovery for the Indian rhesus macaque, considerable gene, locus, and allele discovery work is still needed for this and most other macaque species and subspecies as are MHC Class II discovery efforts. Coupled with gene discovery is the need to define which genes are expressed, including any conditional or cell/tissue-specific expression patterns, and to establish allele or haplotype frequencies within individual colonies or sources of animals used by the research community.</p>
<p>Identification of the complete set of MHC alleles present in an animal has historically required technically challenging and time- and labor-intensive methods and no certainty that all alleles or loci within an individual were detected. Furthermore, the availability of defined genotyping methods or resources for typing of individual alleles is quite limited compared to the large number of alleles already identified. Development of, and accessibility to, high-throughput technologies for MHC allele genotyping and/or haplotype determination are required to accelerate immunological studies in NHP species. Historically, the variety of DNA-based methods have included: reference strand conformational analysis (RSCA), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP), sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) and MHC-linked microsatellites, or short tandem repeats (STRs). The level and accuracy of information provided and the potential limitations differ by technique.</p>
<p>A variety of DNA-based technologies is required for the diverse needs of the NHP research community, including those methods for specific allele genotyping, haplotyping, and complete MHC genotyping. Affordable methods that are easily upgraded as new allelic or haplotype information becomes available are needed, and, for those methods not provided through resource services, they need to be relatively high-throughput and easily translated to laboratories conducting NHP research.</p>
<p>This solicitation to re-compete the NHP MHC Gene Discovery and Typing Development Program will continue and expand upon the initial program goals to advance the detailed knowledge base of NHP MHC genetic loci, alleles, and haplotypes, and their frequencies; better define the NHP MHC genomic organization; and develop robust, high-throughput genotyping and haplotyping methods.</p>
<p>The NIAID anticipates a single multi-year, cost reimbursement completion-type award will be made utilizing FAR Subpart 17.1, for a five (5) year period of performance, beginning on or about April 1, 2011. The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed five 5 years.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. This BAA will be available electronically on/about April 13, 2010, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The Spinal Cord and Musculoskeletal Disorders and Assistive Devices Program (SMAD), within the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research Center of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institute of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 253- (1) and FAR 6.302 - 1(a) (2) (ii), a new contract with Case Western Reserve University, entitled "Controller Development for Upper Limb Movement". The new contract is necessary for completion of the contract project. This modification will allow the Case Western Reserve University and its subcontractors the additional time needed to recruit and study more participants with complete upper limb paralysis due to preferably cervical spinal cord injury and/or possibly brain stem stroke and acquire more significantly powered study endpoints, as well as time to process the data and further refine the algorithms for the controller (e.g. deliverable). The new contract is to continue this study for approximately 24 months.<br />The contract goal continues to be the development of a prototype controller that is designed for future use as an external Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) control system for the restoration of function of one or more movements in the paralyzed upper limbs. The ongoing development of the controller includes a design that incorporates simulation technology for testing and a real-time external FES system that is interfaced with brain signals that are recorded from the motor cortical area of the participant. The extension of the project will enable the highly unique and experienced team of investigators to recruit and test additional participants and acquire and analyze patient data that will ultimately enhance the controller, making it a more powerful tool for translating cortical signals that would eventually drive the FES system for upper limb movement. The additional data will aid in the refinement of the controller and the testing/training technologies necessary for future devices supporting a variety of paralysis. Any new participants for this contract will be implanted with the BrianGate 2 Neural Interface System.<br />To date this study has enabled significant advances in the implementation of the BrainGate implant technology for human participants, the sophisticated software development and computer driven testing of the implant, and the collection and analyses of human cortical signal data pertinent to the eventual control of upper limb motor movement. This research has involved a well established team of investigators who bring unique medical, bioengineering and technological experience, specialized resources and novel approaches that have been essential for the forward progress of the project. There is no other source presently known to NICHD that has access to the currently accrued data and technologies that are necessary for the completion of this complex clinical trial. It would cost the Government significant time and effort to train, recruit, and duplicate the expertise, technologies and clinical resources acquired by Case Western Reserve University and its subcontractors over the past 5 years. If any contractor believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit, within 15 days of publication of this notice, an original and three (3) copies of a capability statement, which will be considered by this agency (plus an electronic copy to ls59u@nih.gov) to: Lynn Salo, Contracting Officer, NICHD CMB, NIH, 6100 Executive Building, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (or overnight courier: 6100 Executive Blvd., Rockville, Maryland 20852). Phone number: 301-435-6962, and FAX number: 301-402-3676. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). No collect calls will be accepted. This requirement is defined as code 541712 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). <br />

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with the Helmholtz Zentrum M&uuml;nchen (HMGU), formerly known as Gorschungszentrum f&uuml;r Umwelt und Gesundheit (GSF- National Research Center for Environment and Health, GmbH), Munich, Germany, for the acquisition of data analyses and manuscript preparation. HMGU is uniquely qualified to perform the services required. HMGU performed data analyses with the EPA Office of Research and Development, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Environmental Public Health Division in 2006-2008 of a study in which volunteers with diabetes were studied while levels of ambient air pollution were measured at their homes. Re-analysis of these data now needs to be performed to determine whether there is a temperature-pollutant interaction that influences the results. HMGU commenced this work as visiting scientist in 2009 and has completed approximately a third of the data analyses during that time. The re-analysis of these data now needs to be completed and reports or manuscripts detailing the results prepared. HMGU has unique experience and insight into the re-analyses and interpretation of the study data and therefore the only vendor capable of satisfying this requirement at this time. The circumstance permitting use of a sole source is FAR 13.501 (a). The NAICS Code is 541712. The anticipated period of performance is 12 months. All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Marsha B. Johnson (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Page Old Page Road, Durham, NC 27703 or email to Johnson.marsha@epa.gov. No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>Establishing a Protocol and Conducting a Pilot Effort for a Biorepository of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Specimens
<SOLNBR>2011-N-13395
<RESPDATE>041811
<CONTACT>Patrick W Gourley, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2898, Email pgourley@cdc.gov
<DESC>Introduction: This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p>Background: The ALS Registry Act (H.R. 2295) was passed on October 16, 2008. The ALS Registry Act amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of DHHS, acting through the Director of CDC, to (1) develop a system to collect data on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); and (2) establish a national registry for the collection and storage of ALS data.</p>
<p>In October, 2010, ATSDR officially launched the National ALS Registry (www.cdc.gov/als). The purpose of the ALS Registry is to better describe the incidence and prevalence of ALS in the United States; examine factors, such as environmental and occupational, that might be associated with the disease; better outline key demographic factors (such as age, race or ethnicity, gender, and family history of individuals who are diagnosed with the disease) associated with the disease; and facilitate examination of the connection between ALS and other motor neuron disorders that can be confused with ALS, misdiagnosed as ALS, and in some cases progress to ALS.</p>
<p>As the National ALS Registry is currently operational, ATSDR is now engaging in a series of activities to further enhance the National ALS Registry. Examples already underway include creating new survey modules to help identify potential risk factors for ALS and developing comprehensive surveillance activities in select states and large metropolitan areas to help test the completeness of the Registry.</p>
<p>Because little is known about the role genetics plays in ALS, ATSDR is interested in establishing a proposed biorepository to collect human specimens from ALS patients who enroll in the National ALS Registry. Such a biorepository will make this a more comprehensive Registry and potentially help scientists and researchers to better understand the genetic causes of ALS.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. The purpose of this proposed acquisition is to establish a protocol for the creation of a biorepository of specimens from persons with ALS enrolled in the National ALS Registry. A subsequent pilot effort will be conducted based upon the protocol developed.</p>
<p>Because the genetic causes of ALS are largely unknown, ATSDR is seeking expert guidance on establishing a biorepository of samples that are linked with ALS patients enrolled in the National ALS Registry. ATSDR is particularly interested in blood and tissue samples. While there are other biorepositories currently in existence that contain specimens from persons with ALS, these biorepositories are often limited and target select groups (e.g., military veterans with ALS). Submission of specimens for this biorepository would be open to all U.S. citizens and Legal Residents of the U.S with ALS enrolled in the congressionally mandated National ALS Registry. The ability to connect the biological material to information about risk factors and data about medical treatment will make the biorepository especially valuable to ALS researchers.</p>
<p>This acquisition will require the preparation of a protocol for the creation of a biorepository of specimens from persons with ALS enrolled in the National ALS Registry. This acquisition will also require a small, subsequent pilot to collect biological samples from Registry enrollees.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this notice is 541990 and the project requirements of the acquisition will include the following scope of services:</p>
<p>Although biorepositories vary in scope and size, it is anticipated that the successful contractor will create a protocol that can be used to develop a biorepository of ALS human samples to complement the National ALS Registry. Before the protocol is developed, the Contractor should convene a group of experts in registries, surveillance, and/or neurological diseases to determine the best practices for establishing a biorepository as described. The Contractor will test and finalize the approved protocol by conducting a pilot to collect biological samples from at least 100 Registry enrollees.</p>
<p>The contractor would be responsible for the following:</p>
<p>1. The Contractor will determine the overall viability of a biorepository linked to persons with ALS who are enrolled in the National ALS Registry.</p>
<p>2. The Contractor will determine the most efficient sample collection strategies (e.g., blood spots, buccal swabs, blood draws) for patients with ALS.</p>
<p>3. The Contractor will give all specimens collected during the pilot to the Government at the end of the pilot.</p>
<p>4. The Contractor will guarantee the security of personal identifying information (PII) during the custody chain. The Contractor will transfer all PII to the Government at the end of the pilot.</p>
<p>5. The Contractor will work closely with the Veterans Administration (VA) to determine how Registry enrollees with military experience can become part of the VA's Brain Banking program.</p>
<p>6. The Contractor will provide guidance on the type of molecular analyses that can be conducted.</p>
<p>7. The Contractor will make recommendations about the most appropriate location(s) to house the repository specimens.<br /><br />8. The Contractor will be responsible for complying with ATSDR's requirement for external peer-review of the protocol and for addressing the comments of the external reviewers.</p>
<p>9. The Contractor will provide ATSDR with quality assessment/quality control procedures for sample collection.</p>
<p>10. The Contractor will produce a final protocol which incorporates all changes needed to respond to comments from the IRB and ATSDR required review.</p>
<p>11. The Contractor will be responsible for executing all aspects of the pilot.</p>
<p>12. The Contractor will be responsible for summarizing all of the findings of the pilot effort in a report.</p>
<p>13. The Contractor will devise a plan for releasing specimens to qualified scientists/researchers.</p>
<p>14. Should scientific publications be developed based on this work, the contractor will comply with ATSDR and CDC requirements for pre-submission review and clearance of scientific documents.</p>
<p>15. Contractor will be required to provide their own off-site work space and equipment.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: It is estimated that this requirement will be conducted over a 48 month period of performance or less.</p>
<p>Other important considerations. It is expected that a successful awardee for this requirement would possess the following qualifications and experience:</p>
<p>1. Substantial experience in conducting studies, program evaluation, program analysis, program management on establishing a biorepository of samples that are linked with patients.</p>
<p>2. Experience in management planning and describing approaches for managing work for specific projects to be performed in public health.</p>
<p>3. Substantial experience developing and utilizing a variety of design and implementation strategies, such as experience in the creation, operation, and intimate-working knowledge of biorepositories and how this experience specifically relates to disease/health registries.</p>
<p>4. Substantial relevant experience collecting samples of human specimens (e.g., blood) and intimate knowledge of requirements to handle them prior to being placed into a biorepository.</p>
<p>5. Capability to acquire staff for specific projects and have access to recognized practicing consultants in environmental public health.</p>
<p>6. Experience developing packages for IRB and OMB PRA submissions.</p>
<p>Capability statement /information sought: In response to this notice, interested parties should provide a capability statement that contains enough detail and information to indicate it has the experience, knowledge and ability to perform the work requirements described herein.</p>
<p>Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via email to Patrick Gourley Contracting Officer at pgourley@cdc.gov no later than 5:00 PM EDT, April 18, 2011.</p>

<DESC>      Sources Sought  NARMS Supplies/Equipment,


The Food and Drug Administration intends to award an IDIQ, commercial type contract on a non-competitive, sole source basis to Trek Diagnostics for the delivery of laboratory equipment/supplies for the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). This is a follow-on to Contract number  HHSF22320061007I with Trek Diagnostics anticipated for one base year and four one year options. NARMS is an inter-agency surveillance program involving FDA, CDC and USDA. Sensititre equipment was installed in all NARMS laboratories at the inception of the program in 1996 to assure methodological consistency. Sensititre specializes in antimicrobial susceptibility testing of veterinary drugs but also supplies products for determination of MICs for drugs that are used to treat human infections. The use of a single test system in all NARMS laboratories insures consistent testing of isolates and enhances comparability of the resulting data. Varying test systems could impart bias into the susceptibility results and thereby preclude trends analysis of MIC data, and  this would severely limit the Governments ability to detect and respond to emerging resistance problems and outbreaks of resistant zoonotic enteric disease. For these reasons, the Sensititre system currently established in NARMS laboratories must continue to be used. The disposable supplies will be used by the Government with its Sensititre equipment which requires ancillary supplies specific to the equipment. Sensititre products are solely distributed in the US by Trek Diagnostics Systems of Cleveland OH. The Sensititre AST (Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test) system is found in human and animal hospitals, and private diagnostic laboratories across the country and internationally.  The vendor will be required to ship NARMS lab supplies to the following four locations on a monthly basis-based on shelf life and need:  CVM, Laurel, MD, CDC, Chamblee GA, USDA, Athens GA, FDA/Denver District Office, Denver CO.
					

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice is issued for informational purposes and not a request for competitive proposals.  Any interested party should submit a statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirements of this synopsis can be met, no later than 10 days from the date of this announcement and reference Sources Sought No. 1086192 . The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 339112.  A determination the Government not to compete the proposed work based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses to this notice must be sent via email to the Contract Specialist/Officer listed.  No phone calls will be accepted. The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice.

<DESC>Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS): Controller Development for Upper Limb Movement
<p>Notice Number: Sources Sought NIH-NICHD-NCMRR-SBSS-2011-15</p>
<p>Announcement Type: Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS)</p>
<p>Agency/Office: National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>Location: Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)</p>
<p>Key Dates:<br />Release Date:<br />Response Date: 10 days after issuance</p>
<p>Purpose of this Announcement: This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 541712 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the small business size standard for such requirements is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Background and Project Requirements: The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) anticipates continuing the project "Controller Development for Upper Limb Movement." We are looking for capability statements from Small Businesses to determine if there are Small Businesses capable of meeting the NICHD's follow-on requirements for a FES motor control system.</p>
<p>The contract goal continues to be the development of a prototype controller that is designed for future use as an external Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) control system for the restoration of function of one or more movements in the paralyzed upper limbs. The ongoing development of the controller includes a design that incorporates simulation technology for testing and a real-time external FES system that is interfaced with brain signals that are recorded from the motor cortical area of the participant. The extension of the project will enable the highly unique and experienced team of investigators to recruit and test additional participants and acquire and analyze patient data that will ultimately enhance the controller, making it a more powerful tool for translating cortical signals that would eventually drive the FES system for upper limb movement. The additional data will aid in the refinement of the controller and the testing/training technologies necessary for future devices supporting a variety of paralysis. Any new participants for this contract will be implanted with the BrianGate 2 Neural Interface System. To date this study has enabled significant advances in the implementation of the BrainGate implant technology for human participants, the sophisticated software development and computer driven testing of the implant, and the collection and analyses of human cortical signal data pertinent to the eventual control of upper limb motor movement. This research has involved a well established team of investigators who bring unique medical, bioengineering and technological experience, specialized resources and novel approaches that have been essential for the forward progress of the project.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance: The anticipated period of performance is 30 months from the time of award.</p>
<p>Capability Statement/Information: The NICHD is seeking Small Businesses capable of meeting the following criteria. 1) Approach-Does the Offeror have the conceptual framework, design methods, analyses, and clinical protocols and assessment in place in order to continue to develop, integrate, and achieve the aims of the project including the engineering capacity to develop appropriate algorithms, design, and test the proposed controller that will interface with cortical implant signals and a FES motor control system? Does the Offeror have the capacity to identify an appropriate patient population to work with an experienced surgical team for implantation of the BrainGate 2 Neural Interface System and to provide the appropriate health care personnel? 2) Personnel and Experience-Does the Offeror have in place a research team that will be involved in the design, development, testing and evaluation of a FES controller that uses cortical signals for human motor control of movement? This must be supported by a track record in designing, developing and testing control systems for physiological functions, device construction, materials and interface issues, translation of engineered devices to clinical applications, and organizational experience in leading a multidisciplinary team of investigators. Does the team include engineers, scientists, and clinicians proficient in the development and testing of controllers, movement deficit, medical rehabilitation expertise that would guide the design of a control system and choice of target upper limb muscle(s), implementation and assessment of the controller and its interface with the human subject, needs of persons with spinal cord injury and upper limb paralysis, clinical research protocols and human safety issues, and previous experience in developing technologies to obtain cortical signals, process signals and input signals to activate limb movement.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in the response. The Government reserves to right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

<DESC>2011 Air Force/Industry Nuclear Weapons Technology Interchange Workshop for Independent Research &amp; Development (IR&amp;D) and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Commercialization Pilot Program (CPP)<br />The Air Force Global Strike Command (GSC), in partnership with the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (NWC), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and the AF Independent Research &amp; Development (IR&amp;D) Program Office, will conduct an Air Force/Industry Nuclear Weapons Technology Interchange Workshop (TIW) on 2-3 Aug 2011 at Kirtland Air Force Base NM. This workshop is classified at the SECRET level and limited to U.S. citizens. This is a Step 1 workshop within the AF IR&amp;D framework, wherein the AF presents to industry its current Science and Technology (S&amp;T) needs, solutions, and gaps traceable to specific mission areas, i.e., nuclear enterprise for this event. This invitation is open to DoD military and civilians, DoD technical support contractors, and industry contractors with a SECRET clearance, maintaining a valid DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, and meeting the requirements indicated in this announcement. <br />This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the government in any way. Response to this request is voluntary and will not impact any future acquisitions. Moreover, this announcement expands on the information in the public announcement made in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website pertaining to this classified workshop. Please respond to the appropriate point of contact (POC) 60 days prior to the event with intent to attend this workshop. Note that specific major contractor attendance criteria exist for both the IR&amp;D and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) technical tracks.<br />The general format of this workshop is planned as follows:
<p>1. On day one, a classified eight-hour plenary session is intended for presentation of four major topics:<br />a. The current nuclear weapons technology needs required to support the GSC capabilities, as shown in the GSC S&amp;T guidance; <br />b. NWC's approach to meeting their capabilities' needs; <br />c. AFRL's technology solutions approach to meeting those needs; and<br />d. How industry can engage in filling technology gaps.<br />2. On day two, there will be two simultaneous events relevant to the technical presentations of day one:</p>
<p>a. A classified IR&amp;D one-on-one question and answer (Q&amp;A) session between interested major defense contractors and AF nuclear enterprise subject matter experts. This AF team of experts will conduct private Q&amp;A sessions, approximately 20 minutes in duration. These sessions will afford major contractors an opportunity to ask technical questions and receive clarification on nuclear technology data presented during the classified plenary session. This opportunity is provided to major contractors only to assist in preparation for the IR&amp;D Step 2 workshop following tentatively 4 months, i.e., December 2011, after the Step 1 workshop. In this Step 2 event, industry presents relevant portions of their respective IR&amp;D portfolio germane to GSC's capability gaps addressed in Step 1.</p>
<p>b. Optional SBIR Commercialization Pilot Program (CPP) one-on-one sessions between prime contractors and small businesses are available on day two. These sessions focus on opportunities to discuss transition of specific SBIR projects to major contractors, AFRL portfolios, and AF programs of record. Please note, small businesses' attendance in this track is by invitation from prime contractors only.<br />Who Can Participate<br />The attending companies must:</p>
<p>1. If a major contractor, meet the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) 31.205-18(a)(iii) definition of a major contractor which states "any contractor whose covered segments allocated a total of more than $11,000,000 in IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year...".</p>
<p>2. Meet the Defense Contracting Audit Agency (DCAA) criteria of major defense contractor (essentially, any contractor with $90 million or more in annual auditable costs for the prior fiscal year).</p>
<p>3. If a small business, be invited by a major contractor.</p>
<p>4. Maintain a valid DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. DD Form 2345 must be valid at least six months beyond the date of the event.</p>
<p>5. Have a SECRET clearance and submit a visit request via JPAS. Point of contact for this request is Mr. Al Sullen at Kirtland and the SMO code is KV1MFSCC6. If your company does not have access to JPAS, visit requests can be faxed following the instructions in Section E, Contents of a Visit Request, of this document.</p>
<p>NOTE: We request major defense contractor representatives attending this event be fully aware of their respective company's IR&amp;D portfolio.<br />Response Instructions and Points of Contact (POCs)<br />Please respond to the FedBizOpps publication regarding the August 2011 workshop.

<p>A. The IR&amp;D Process<br />This workshop is the first in a three-step IR&amp;D process executed to sustain an active dialogue on collaboration of technology solutions for the AF nuclear enterprise. <br />1. Step 1. <br />Step 1 includes a classified plenary session in which GSC, NWC, other product centers, and AFRL will brief industry on:<br />a. The current nuclear weapons technology needs, as shown in the GSC S&amp;T guidance, required to support the GSC capabilities; <br />b. NWC's approach to meeting their capabilities' needs; <br />c. AFRL's technology solutions approach to meeting those needs; and<br />d. How industry can engage in filling technology gaps.</p>

<DESC>2011 Air Force/Industry Nuclear Weapons Technology Interchange Workshop for Independent Research &amp; Development (IR&amp;D) and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Commercialization Pilot Program (CPP)<br />The Air Force Global Strike Command (GSC), in partnership with the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (NWC), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and the AF Independent Research &amp; Development (IR&amp;D) Program Office, will conduct an Air Force/Industry Nuclear Weapons Technology Interchange Workshop (TIW) on 2-3 Aug 2011 at Kirtland Air Force Base NM. This workshop is classified at the SECRET level and limited to U.S. citizens. This is a Step 1 workshop within the AF IR&amp;D framework, wherein the AF presents to industry its current Science and Technology (S&amp;T) needs, solutions, and gaps traceable to specific mission areas, i.e., nuclear enterprise for this event. This invitation is open to DoD military and civilians, DoD technical support contractors, and industry contractors with a SECRET clearance, maintaining a valid DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, and meeting the requirements indicated in this announcement. <br />This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the government in any way. Response to this request is voluntary and will not impact any future acquisitions. Moreover, this announcement expands on the information in the public announcement made in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website pertaining to this classified workshop. Please respond to the appropriate point of contact (POC) 60 days prior to the event with intent to attend this workshop. Note that specific major contractor attendance criteria exist for both the IR&amp;D and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) technical tracks.<br />The general format of this workshop is planned as follows:
<p>1. On day one, a classified eight-hour plenary session is intended for presentation of four major topics:<br />a. The current nuclear weapons technology needs required to support the GSC capabilities, as shown in the GSC S&amp;T guidance; <br />b. NWC's approach to meeting their capabilities' needs; <br />c. AFRL's technology solutions approach to meeting those needs; and<br />d. How industry can engage in filling technology gaps.<br />2. On day two, there will be two simultaneous events relevant to the technical presentations of day one:</p>
<p>a. A classified IR&amp;D one-on-one question and answer (Q&amp;A) session between interested major defense contractors and AF nuclear enterprise subject matter experts. This AF team of experts will conduct private Q&amp;A sessions, approximately 20 minutes in duration. These sessions will afford major contractors an opportunity to ask technical questions and receive clarification on nuclear technology data presented during the classified plenary session. This opportunity is provided to major contractors only to assist in preparation for the IR&amp;D Step 2 workshop following tentatively 4 months, i.e., December 2011, after the Step 1 workshop. In this Step 2 event, industry presents relevant portions of their respective IR&amp;D portfolio germane to GSC's capability gaps addressed in Step 1.</p>
<p>b. Optional SBIR Commercialization Pilot Program (CPP) one-on-one sessions between prime contractors and small businesses are available on day two. These sessions focus on opportunities to discuss transition of specific SBIR projects to major contractors, AFRL portfolios, and AF programs of record. Please note, small businesses' attendance in this track is by invitation from prime contractors only.<br />Who Can Participate<br />The attending companies must:</p>
<p>1. If a major contractor, meet the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) 31.205-18(a)(iii) definition of a major contractor which states "any contractor whose covered segments allocated a total of more than $11,000,000 in IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year...".</p>
<p>2. Meet the Defense Contracting Audit Agency (DCAA) criteria of major defense contractor (essentially, any contractor with $90 million or more in annual auditable costs for the prior fiscal year).</p>
<p>3. If a small business, be invited by a major contractor.</p>
<p>4. Maintain a valid DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. DD Form 2345 must be valid at least six months beyond the date of the event.</p>
<p>5. Have a SECRET clearance and submit a visit request via JPAS. Point of contact for this request is Mr. Al Sullen at Kirtland and the SMO code is KV1MFSCC6. If your company does not have access to JPAS, visit requests can be faxed following the instructions in Section E, Contents of a Visit Request, of this document.</p>
<p>NOTE: We request major defense contractor representatives attending this event be fully aware of their respective company's IR&amp;D portfolio.<br />Response Instructions and Points of Contact (POCs)<br />Please respond to the FedBizOpps publication regarding the August 2011 workshop.

<DESC>This is a sole-source synopsis that provides notification of the 30th Contracting Squadron's intent to extend contract FA4610-04-C-0004, Launch Operations Support Contract (LOSC) for a period of three months. The period of performance for this extension will be from 1 April 2011 through 30 June 2011. This extension is needed to satisfy the Wing's LOSC requirement until award of LOSC solicitation; FA4610-08-R-0016 can be completed. Not awarding a three-month extension would cause serious injury to the government. The extension will be performed by the incumbent contractor, Call Henry Inc., 308 Pine Street Titusville, FL 32796-3556. A competitive set-aside was awarded on 20 Aug 2004 to provide LOSC services for the 30th Space Wing (30SW), Vandenberg AFB, CA. Services provide mission infrastructure support for the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS), Western Range operations, which is designated as a Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), Pillar Point, Anderson Peak, Hawaiian sites, Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB), and VAFB surrounding areas. Services include maintenance, modification, and modernization for the aging facility, property, and Western Range support equipment to ensure successful performance during tests, operations, and launch. Additional services provide periodic maintenance, operation, and repair of various infrastructure, and mandatory certification, maintenance, and operations of facility property and equipment (e.g. alarms, cranes &amp; hoists, elevators, generators, mechanical, pressure vessels, structural, towers, utilities) which support critical mission requirements. The extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted services of the Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) operations described above. This three-month extension of services is accomplished pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, " as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of the work required during the extension period would be advantageous to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this contract extension period based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to Audrey Guerra at e-mail address Audrey.Guerra@vandenberg.af.mil.

<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Government's intent to modify its Job Order Contract (JOC) for Repair and Maintenance/Minor Construction of Real Property at Fort Drum, New York, to increase the maximum capacity of Contract Number W911S2-08-D-8002 by $13.0 million. This increase is necessary due to unanticipated delays in the ongoing pre-award process for a follow-on contract. Without this modification, Fort Drum will have no contract vehicle in place to permit timely placement of necessary construction projects. A determination not to compete this requirement is anticipated to be made pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304 (C) (1) and FAR 6.302-1. <br><br>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation for offers. No award will be placed solely on the basis of this notice, since synopsis of intent to place an order cannot be considered a request for proposals or offers. Responses to this notice will be used to determine if bonafide competition exists and whether a request for proposal is appropriate or feasible. Response to this notice must be made within seven calendar days after the posted date. <br><br>Fort Drum's new competitive follow-on contract is currently synopsized under Solicitation Number W911S2-11-R-8000 and is posted to www.fbo.gov. <br>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;<strong>Sole Source Justification</strong>:&nbsp; The statutory authority for use of 'other than full and open competition' for this transaction is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">Requirement:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Portable (battery operated) high intensity laser based forensic trace evidence detection system with emission at 532 nm.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">Coherent, Inc. is the only commercial source for high power 532 nm lasers that permit battery operation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, only Coherent Inc. has designed and engineered a system specifically for the forensic community, which incorporates and meets our specific needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have reviewed the available alternate candidates that have been targeted toward the laser based forensic market and have them lacking in a number of areas, portability (weight), the ability to function in a remote location (battery operation) and performance (lack of interference lines or speckle).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While most of the alternate offerings are based on industrial or lab based lasers, only Coherent has packaged a solid state laser with the reliability requirements specific to the forensic market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is also a key reason for their superior reliability.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">Basic Performance Requirements:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">Low Weight and Small Size</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Tracer offers a complete laser package with the lowest weight and smallest footprint in the forensic laser market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The system is designed to be carried with a minimum amount of weight, without requiring a wheeled system.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">Benefits</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A low weight and small footprint allows the Tracer to avoid the problems associated with a device attached to wheels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wheels add weight, cause the system to experience more potentially damaging shocks, and are virtually impossible to use on sand or rough surfaces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, wheels have the potential to create static discharge - a risk for locations that potentially involve explosive devices, and they can damage a crime scene since the wheels are physically touching potential evidence.</span></p>

<p>2. QUESTIONS: Questions regarding this request for quotation should be submitted to Joseph Pishioneri, via e-mail to joseph.pishioneri@eeoc.gov. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. The deadline for submission of questions regarding RFQ0022-11 is April 6, 2011, 11:00 a.m. ET. Any questions received after the specified date and time above will not be responded to. The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated contract award date is on or before May 6, 2011.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a firm fixed-price contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance): Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements. Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to meeting space, audiovisual equipment and technical support, food and beverage service and menu options, business services, and lodging. Quotations must address the quoter's ability to meet or exceed the requirements of the ADA, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act as it relates to the facility conference space, lodging, and parking. Quotations will be evaluated on the quality of the customer services provided, the layout design and quality of the facilities as reflected by the physical layout and atmosphere of meeting space and the maintenance and upkeep of the facilities including amenities to support the conference such as free wi-fi in the conference space. (b) Location. Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility in Houston, TX, near a major freeway/beltway/highway which provides low-cost or free parking.<br />(c) Availability of Dates. Quoters will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to quotations which demonstrate availability of facilities on the preferred dates in order of preference, i.e. 1st choice date, 2nd choice date, and 3rd choice date.</p>
<p>Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities portion of the technical evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance of similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or non-government client; 2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client's program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on room design/layout and quality/upkeep of the facilities and d&eacute;cor, and the availability of amenities (e.g., high-speed internet, etc) and staff to support the conference. In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Cost Estimate. Each quoter shall complete the Response Form, Attachment A. which includes the quoter's pricing quotation. Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all line items listed in this RFQ in the units and format provided; pricing of recommended menu options for breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages; rates for audio-visual and business services; sleeping room rates; and cost options for facility parking rates. The EEOC is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales tax in quotations for which the Federal Government is exempt.</p>
<p>Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items and 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, and 52.222-52 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Certification, apply to this acquisition.

<DESC>OMBUDSMAN-NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTEST
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contract the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606<br />Washington, D.C. 20593<br />Telephone (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202) 372-3949</p>
<p>The Request for Quotation number is HSCG79-11-Q-PCR047 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50. This acquisition is unrestricted for offers' business size 1500 employees. The NAICS is 481212. The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format at FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation to be issued. Proposals are being requested as a written solicitation will not be issued. Purchase order to be awarded shall be under the authority of FAR part 12 "Acquisitions of Commercial Items". The Government proposes to solicit offers for the following services and quantities:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE: The NDS Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter. There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season. Fuel type is propane unless otherwise noted. Typical transportation of fuel to these sites will include the use of a barge and/or helicopter. Full 125 gallon "pickle barrels" are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the remote site by a helicopter rated for that load. A fuel mechanic removes the barrels from the sling and transfers the propane from the pickle barrels to standard 500 gallon propane tanks. This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity. Offeror must have experience with this type of task due to high risks associated with it.</p>
<p>FUEL REQUIREMENT: Fuel Requirement: Contractor shall fuel remote site with propane quantities and delivery date per Attachment 1 requirement. All tanks are to be filled to maximum capacity. Government estimate for fuel amounts should be +/- 10 % for each site, due to the accuracy of the gauges. Contractor shall be prepared to account for this variation by carrying up to 10 % more fuel than fixed requirement calls for to handle this contingency. Contractor shall perform propane leak checks (soap spray or sniffer) on all propane tanks and fuel lines at NDS remote sites, up to the location where fuel line enters generator hut. Leaks found during these inspections shall be isolated and repaired. In the event of an irreparable leak requiring additional cost to repair, notify the Contracting Officer immediately for action to be taken. The Contractor shall record actual gallons of propane delivered to each site on the invoice and tank gauge level percentages before and after filling. All documentation will be delivered to Contracting Officer within one week of work completion.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study that will determine the technical and economic viability of expanding and strengthening Ghana's electricity transmission network with a new 62 mile power transmission line between Asiekpe and Kpandu, and a new 143 mile transmission line between Kadjebi and Yendi.</p>
<p>Presently, all northbound power transmission is routed through the west and center of the country, leaving the majority of communities on the east side of Lake Volta without power. Presently, a 69 kilovolt (kV) line extends 62 miles north from Asiekpe to Kpandu. This FS will make recommendations on the economic and technical feasibility of constructing a new 161 kV line parallel to this line. Continuing north, a 37 mile 69 kV (upgradeable to 161 kV) line is under construction using funding from the Government of Belgium which will connect Kpandu to Kadjebi. This FS will also make recommendations on connecting these two lines together at Kpandu. Finally, the FS will provide an assessment on the development of a new 161 kV line continuing 143 miles north from Kadjebi to Yendi where it will connect to an existing power transmission line, thus completing a full circuit around Lake Volta.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $645,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.

<DESC><p>This solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted, incorporate technical changes and extend the due date for quotations.</p>
<p>1. Vendor questions and answers:<br />The following questions and answers apply to the system specifications for Line Item 0001:</p>
<p>Question: Does "central data collection / data logger unit" refer to a centralized computer, running appropriate collection / logging software?</p>
<p>Answer: It can be a "centralized computer, running appropriate collection/logging software" or it can be any other piece of equipment (computer or otherwise) that provides for the display of the information received from the individual area monitors in real time as well as logging/ archiving this same data for later trending.</p>
<p><br />Question: Specification 2, "Provide indication of master alarm, such that if any one channel is in an alarm state the master alarm will indicate alarm status and radiation level". Does "indication of master alarm" refer to an alarm indication at the central data collection / data logger unit?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p>Question: Specification 3 "Capable of acknowledging an alarm event without clearing the alarm from the master location only". Does this requirement mean that an alarm should be able to be acknowledged at the local monitor without clearing the alarm status at the master location?</p>
<p>Answer: No, just the opposite. The master location should only be able to acknowledge an alarm received, not reset it. The ability to reset (or clear) the alarm should only be locally at the area monitor itself.</p>
<p><br />Question: Specification 3 " Capable of acknowledging an alarm event without clearing the alarm from master location only" Does this mean when the alarm is acknowledged from the master computer terminal it will also be acknowledged at the field processing unit?<br />Answer: Yes, the alarm should be acknowledged (i.e., silenced) both locally and at the central or master location. It should only be resettable (i.e., cleared) locally at the remote location.</p>
<p><br />Question: Specification 5 "Allow detectors to be placed at locations separate from the local readout". What is the approximate distance (or maximum distance) expected between the detectors and the local readouts?</p>
<p>Answer: At this time, all detectors are collocated with their readout module. The requirement here is to ensure that the detector is not an integral part of the electronics/readout unit.</p>
<p><br />Question: Specification 5 " Allow detectors to be placed at locations separate from the local readout" Please provide the required cable lengths, or an estimate of the average cable length, between the detector and local readout location. <br />Answer: At this time, all detectors are collocated with their readout module. The requirement here is to ensure that the detector is not an integral part of the electronics/readout unit.</p>
<p>Question: Specification 7 "Provide a central data logging and data display / trending of all channels". Assuming that this requirement refer to contractor-supplied software that performs the indicated functions, would the software be run at the master location only?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, only at the centralized location not at each remote area monitor unit.</p>
<p>Question: Specification 9 "Automatic restart with all data and parameters saved in the event of a power interruption". Does NIST intend to use AC to power the area monitors? How far from the intended locations of the local area monitors will the AC outlets be?</p>
<p>Answer: The present system distributes the power from the centralized radiation recorder rack to the individual locations through the interconnecting cabling. This can be duplicated by the Contractor or, if the Contractor's proposed equipment requires local power, it can be provided by NIST. The new installation has two (2) conduits leading to two (2) electrical boxes (4"x4"). One of these can be fitted with a duplex outlet fed from the building power system.</p>
<p><br />Question: Specification 11 "Able to communicate through Ethernet based network or to be adaptable to Ethernet based network". Does this requirement refer to the communication between the local area monitor and the central data collection / data logger unit?</p>
<p>Answer: No, only applies to the communication link between the central data collection/data logger unit and our equipment in the Control Room. How they communicate between each area monitor unit and the centralized data collection equipment is determined by the Contractor.</p>
<p>Question: Specification 11 "Able to communicate through Ethernet based network or be adaptable to Ethernet based network" Does NIST desire Ethernet communication between the master computer terminal and each field processing unit (monitor)? If not, what provisions will be made for serial link communications between the local readouts and the master computer terminal? What would the intended use be for the Ethernet communication and where would the Ethernet connect (monitor and/or master location)?</p>
<p>Answer: NIST is only concerned with the protocol between the master unit and the equipment in the Main Control Room (MCR). The decision on how to communicate between the central or master unit and the remote units are up to the Contractor. The intended use of the information in the MCR is to allow the reactor operators to see the levels and to be alerted to any alarms associated with the Radiation Monitoring System.</p>
<p>Question: Specification 13 "Provide relay contacts to operate auxiliary equipment for alarm event or equipment failure". How many relays are required for the local area monitor?</p>
<p>Answer: Two (2) sets of dry contacts.<br />Question: Specification 14 "Provide all necessary equipment to allow the ability to check the internal electronics or expose detector to an internal radiation check source and specify the methodology for the ability" Would you accept an alternate methodology? <br />Answer: It is up to the Contractor to quote a system that is capable of meeting the minimum requirements as stated within. The Government shall not specify what methodology a Contractor shall use to meet them.</p>
<p>Question: Spec 15 "Documentation to be provided at time of delivery, Detailed information about communication protocol for allowing NIST staff to adapt output from their unit to third party software and specify the method for the ability to check the internal electronics or expose detector to an internal radiation check source". Please clarify what is meant by "their unit" and "third party software." Does "their unit" refer to the contractor-supplied area monitors, or some other (pre-existing) instrument used by NIST staff. As well, does "third party software" refer to the contractor-supplied software?</p>
<p>Answer: This requirement concerns the definition of the communication protocol between the central data collection/data logger provided by the successful bidder and the equipment in the Main Control Room. It does not refer to the communications link between the central data collection/data logger equipment and the area monitors. "Third party software" refers to the software used in the equipment located in the Main Control Room.</p>
<p><br />Question: "Documentation to be provided at time of delivery, detailed information about communication protocol for allowing NIST staff to adapt output from their unit to third party software and specify the method for the ability to check the internal electronics or expose detector to an internal radiation check source". Is the purpose of this for communication with the monitor other than from the master computer terminal? How would these checks be performed?</p>
<p>Answer: This is really two separate and independent requirements. The first concerning the communications protocol deals with our ability to get this information up to the Main Control Room. The second concerns how the equipment supplied is tested. Currently, each remote unit has a check source used to verify that the channel is working. This is a manual test. The NCNR needs to know how the bidders intend to meet this requirement.</p>
<p><br />Question: Specification 18 " Allow remote (central location) set up of individual channel and group calibration parameters". Does the requirement of "remote set up" mean that the central data collection / data logger unit should also be able to send commands / parameters changes to the local area monitors? Please clarify what is meant by "calibration parameters." Typically, area monitors are calibrated in a controlled environment (e.g. calibration laboratory) while off line. Does NIST intend to calibrate the area monitors remotely?</p>
<p>Answer: NIST will maintain and calibrate the equipment provided on a regular basis using known sources. There may be times when it will be necessary to remotely configure the area monitors or to download calibration parameters. This capability is desirable, which is why preference shall be given to equipment with these capabilities.</p>
<p><br />The following questions apply to Line Item 0002 for system installation:</p>
<p>Question: Will NIST be supplying Ethernet cable and/or other cable that may be required for monitor communications?</p>
<p>Answer: NIST (NCNR) will supply the cable between the central or master unit and the Main Control Room. The system supplied by the Contractor must include the interconnecting wiring for their system.</p>
<p>Question: Will NIST be installing cable and conduit or will it be the responsibility of the Contractor?</p>
<p>Answer: The cabling between the central or master unit and the remote units is the responsibility of the Contractor. As stated above, the cabling between the central or master unit and existing equipment in the Main Control Room will be the responsibility of NIST (NCNR). Additionally, the current system in the existing Guide Hall utilizes cable trays which are available. The new Guide Hall had conduit and cable trays installed.</p>
<p>Question: Is the contractor responsible for design change associated with mounting the monitors and the subsequent installation?</p>
<p>Answer: The remote sensors for the existing system are mounted on brackets on the vertical columns that run around the perimeter of the building. Provisions have been made in the construction of the new building for them to be mounted to the vertical columns in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Question: Are detailed drawings available if contractor is responsible for any or all of the above?</p>
<p>Answer: Detailed drawings of the existing and new Guide Hall buildings are available if required by the contractor.</p>
<p>Question: Will 120V 60Hz power be available at the radiation monitor location?</p>
<p>Answer: The present installation draws power from a centralized location. No provision was included in the construction of the new building.</p>
<p>Question: What is the building material that the monitor will attach to?</p>
<p>Answer: Brackets are mounted to the construction steel of the building.</p>
<p>Question: Is NIST a union only shop? Will the contractor/subcontractor be required to provide union craft labor for the purpose of installing the monitoring system?</p>
<p>Answer: No, as this installation shall apply to equipment.</p>
<p>Question: "System Installation" Does this mean that NIST needs "turn-key installation" or "installation assistance?"</p>
<p>Answer: Our desire is for turn-key installation for the guide hall channels, only. NCNR staff will install those channels located in the Confinement Building.</p>
<p>The following question and answer applies to Line Item 0003:</p>
<p>Question: In order to facilitate the necessary time and material required for a fixed price training session, how many personnel will be trained?</p>
<p>Answer: The contractor should plan on training 12-15 people on the new equipment.</p>
<p>Question: Is a drawing of the Guide Hall and the proposed monitor locations available?</p>
<p>Answer: See attachment Drawing E043 Rev 0 for existing monitor locations and Drawing 235-665 Rev 1 for the layout of the new guide hall.</p>
<p>Question: Is the Confinement Building a different building than the Guide Hall? If so, can we have a drawing of that building also?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, however, installation in the confinement building is not a part of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Question: Is a Centralized Data Acquisition System a part of this inquiry, or will it be provided by the Purchaser?</p>
<p>Answer: The Centralized Data Acquisition System is a part of this requirement.</p>
<p>Question: Is the Master Alarm part of the Centralized Data Acquisition System?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the master alarm is part of the centralized data acquisition system.</p>
<p><br />Question: What is the required delivery time frame for the equipment?</p>
<p>Answer: The required delivery time for the equipment, upon receipt of the approval of the design, shall be not later than seventy five (75) days.</p>

<p>The schedule on page 4 of the solicitation correctly indicates the white paper submission deadline is 4:00 pm today, 4/4/11. Pages 33-34 of the solicitation incorrectly indicates "the system will disable... submission activities at 12 noon on the deadline date..."</p>
<p>Please be advised, the 12 noon deadline is a typo.</p>
<p>THE 4:00 PM WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION DEADLINE TIME IS THE CORRECT LISTING.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS </strong>- United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This amendment is issued to change the Point of Contact for subject BAA to Ms. Karen Fletcher, e-mail:  Karen.fletcher3@us.army.mil.<br><br>Using a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the US Army Aviation & Missile Research, Development & Engineering Center (USA AMRDEC), Applied Technology Initiatives Directorate (ATI) is interested in receiving proposals from offerors capable of satisfying Government requirements for research and development utilizing new and innovative technologies to advance the capabilities in Applied Technology for interceptor technologies and defense infrastructure technologies. Proposals with new and innovative technologies are needed which could enhance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge for the following areas: Proposals should address one of the technical areas listed: A: INTERCEPTOR TECHNOLOGIES, 1. Interceptor Systems, 2. Threat Negation Systems, 3. Simulation and Modeling Systems, 4. Command, Control & Communications Systems, 5. Networks, 6. System Interoperability, 7. System Requirements, 8. Other Applicable Interceptor Applied Technology Systems, and B: DEFENSE INFRAST RUCTURE TECHNOLOGIE S (AIR, CRUISE MISSILE, ARMOR, FORCE PROTECTION AND OTHER), 1. Interceptor Systems, 2. Integrated Missile Systems, 3. Simulation and Modeling, 4. Target Systems, 5. Transportation Systems, 6. System Operational Analysis, 7. Battle Management Systems, 8. F ire Control Systems, 9. Directed Energy Systems, 10. Other Applicable Defense Infrastructure Applied Technologies. All development activities related to this BAA are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, Executive Order 12470, and/or DOD Directive 5230.25. This acquisition is not open to foreign firms. Any con tractor or subcontractor considering this BAA can not have foreign nationals working on the effort. Foreign Nationals (also known as foreign persons) means any person who is NOT a citizen or national of the US; or a lawful permanent resident; or a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C 13 24b(a)(3). In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that the offerors first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation. From this summary concept paper the Government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Government and whether a formal proposal would be likely to succeed. The Government, at its opt ion, may provide comments that might be of assistance to the submitter in determining how or whether to submit a BAA proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated as soon as they are received. Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will no t be made, and concept papers will not be returned. The Contracting Office will ask only those offerors with promising concept papers to submit full technical and cost proposals. The Contracting Office will notify offerors within 90 days of receipt of concept paper if a full proposal is requested. Concept papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data. All proprietary material should be clearly marked. The summary concept paper should state the proposed technical concept including the ration ale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and its contribution to the USA AMRDEC. In addition, the summary concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost and offerors past performance on Government contracts. The concept paper shall be limited to 5 pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), of English text with one additional page for technical drawing if necessary, and shall be in MS Word for Windows format. All concept papers, proposals, written communications or documentation concerning this BAA shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Karen Fletcher, via e-mail:  Karen.fletcher3@us.army.mil. Facsimile proposal submission is not authorized under this announcement. No classified data shall be included in the concept paper o r proposal. A review of concept papers by the Government will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to merit a formal proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated based on technical merit and offerors past performance. Technical merit will rank significantly higher than past performance. If there is sufficient interest, a formal proposal will be requested. Contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals unless invited to do so by the Contracting Office. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs. The cost of proposal preparation or response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract and interested parties should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published. Proposals may range from theoretical studies to a proof-of-concept that includes fabrication, delivery and test of prototypes. USA AMRDEC is interested in receiving proposals for the research efforts described under this BAA. USA AMRDEC contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those technical areas listed above. Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract. Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee completion and/or level of effort type contracts are expected to be awarded. For planning purposes, awards are anticipated in the $100K to $30M range for the basic contract with a period of performance not to exceed 36 months. In addition to the basic contract, up to four options can be proposed. However, the total contract value (of each individual contract) for the basic and options cannot exceed $75M and the total period of performance for the basic and options cannot exceed 60 months. This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of the final report. The following reports may be required (specific reporting requirements will be specified b y the Government in the event a contractor is requested to submit a formal proposal): 1. FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPOR T, DI-FNCL-80331/M, monthly; 2. TECHNICAL REPORT, DI-MISC-80508, as required and a onetime Final report; 3. STATUS REPORTS, D I-MGMT-80368, monthly; 4.

PERIODIC PROGRAM REVIEWS (such as IPRs, SRRs, SDRs, etc.), as required. 7. DA Manpower Reporting Requirements. Long term proposals should contain a summary of the work contemplated for each 12-month period, so that contract s may be negotiated for an entire five-year project or for individual one-year increments of the total project. A detailed performance schedule for each discrete task must be included along with cost data to include labor-by-labor category. To be eligible for award of a contract, a prospective contractor must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, and ability to comply with the performance schedule. This acquisition is not open to foreign participation at any level. The Government will provide selected offerors with proposal content requirements. Proposal content and format shall contain and not be limited to: (1) Statement of Work (SOW): The SOW should be a concise document suitable for incorporation into a resultant contract. It should provide a qualitative description of the proposed work, which should be described in terms of advancement, improvement, or end product to be developed. The SOW should state the objectives to be achieved and how these objectives would benefit the Government. These objectives should be stated in terms of their potential usefulness to the Research & Development and Warfighter communities at and supported by the USA AMRDEC. The SOW should also include a proposed schedule detailing significant milestones and deliverables. (2) One page Resumes of the offeror's key personnel (including alternates, if desired) who will be involved in the research. Documentation of previous work or experience in the field of the proposer is especially important. (3) The type of support, if any, the offeror requests of the USA AMRDEC, such as facilities, equipment, or materials. Any request by offerors for Government furnished property/equipment must be clearly identified in the proposal. The Government is under no obligation to comply with such requests. Thus, offerors should make provisions for alternate approaches in the event the Government is unwilling or unable to provide the requested property/equipment. (4) A statement regarding possible im pact, if any, of the proposal's effect on the environment. (5) A brief description of your organization. (6) The facilities to be used for the work, if appropriate for and understanding of the proposal. (7) A listing of current similar R&D contracts along with Government POCs (contracting officer & technical) shall be included. The financial portion of the proposal should contain a cost estimate that is sufficiently detailed by element of cost for meaningful evaluation and must include sufficient detail to support and explain all costs proposed, giving figures and narrative explanation. Cost proposals must contain certifiable cost or pricing data, and shall be in sufficient detail to allow direct and indirect rate verification. The budget must include the total estimated cost of the project. The estimated project costs must be broken down for each year of the program to show the following: (1) A list of participants, not necessarily by name, showing the time and number of direct productive person hours (DPPHs) to be charged by principal investigator(s), research associates, and assistants, and the total amount per year to be paid to each from the project. For proposals from universities, the time and amounts to be charged should be identified by academic year and summer effort. (2) An itemized list of permanent equipment showing the cost of each item. Permanent equipment is any article of non-expendable tangible personal property having a useful life of more than two years, and an acquisition cost of $500 or more per unit. (3) A general description and total estimated cost of expendable equipment and supplies. (4) Contemplated expenditures for travel with brief explanation. Travel budgets that exceed $1,50 0 per principal investigator per year or that include foreign travel or travel by other than principal investigators will require special investigation. (5) Other direct costs. (6) Cost for consulting services, if any, showing number of days, daily rates, and estimated travel/per diem costs. The need for consulting services must be fully justified. (7) Indirect costs indicating whether rates used are fixed or provisional, and the time frames to which they are applicable (e.g. , a fixed rate may apply until a specified date, after which the rate becomes provisional). (8) The fee, if any, which the organization proposes to assess the research project. (9) Subcontracts and material costs proposed must be fully supported and documented (written quotes, engineering estimates, etc). Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy. Subcontracting goals for small business are 40%, for veteran owned small business 3%, for service disabled veteran owned small business 3%, Hubzone small business 3%, small disadvantaged business (includes HBCUs/MIs) 5%, and women-owned small business 5%. These goals are to be considered when proposals are submitted. The Government anticipates that any contract resulting from this BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22 Limitation of Funds. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement. The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical merit, importance to agency programs, and funds availability. Management, cost realism and reasonableness, and past performance shall also be considered. The following factors will be considered in the evaluation of proposals received under this BAA. General: The government selection of the proposal(s) for award will be based o n an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical and management in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance, using the area s and factors set forth below. The Government anticipates multiple awards under this announcement, though no minimum or maximum number of awards can be guaranteed. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPON SES RECEIVED. Evaluation Factors for Technical Area: a. Overall Scientific/Technical Quality: The offeror will be evaluated on the overall scientific/technical merits of the proposed research and development. The scientific/technical merits may include potential for state-of-the-art improvement, with special emphasis on innovation, originality and uniqueness. b. Qualifications: Capabilities and qualifications of the key research personnel relevant offeror experience and adequacy of facilities and instrumentation as required. The offeror shall also be evaluated on past technical performance of current similar R&D contracts. c. Research and Development Contribution: Potential contribution of the proposed research to USA AMRDEC in the above technology areas. E valuation Factors Management Area: a. Overall Scheduling and Planning: The offeror's approach will be evaluated based on the overall scheduling and planning for performance of the effort. b. Expenditure Control: The approach for controlling expenditures an d labor hours. c. Past Performance: The offeror's past performance for similar work will be considered. Evaluation Factors Cost Area: a. Cost Realism: The proposal will be evaluated to assess the likelihood that the technical and management approaches proposed could be accomplished at the cost proposed. b. Total Evaluated Probable Cost: The proposal will be evaluated to develop the government's estimate of the most probable cost to the government of successfully completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed. Relative Importance of Evaluation Criteria: 1. Technical: The technical area is significantly more important than the management area. The factors under the technical area are of equal importance. 2. Management: The management area is significantly less important than the technical area. The factors under the management area are of equal importance. 3. Cost: Although the technical and management areas are more important than the cost area, cost is still considered a significant evaluation factor. Proposed costs must be fully detailed and have a complete justification. The total proposed cost must be within the total contract value as specified in the Introduction of this BAA . Selection of proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical and management in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance. In some cases the merits of a particular proposal in a technical discipline may lead to a decision with respect to funds availability relevant to the Applied Technology Initiatives Directorate customer goals. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.

Please indicate preference as to whether or not any future development rights would be shared with the government if a partnership were to develop. Include additional supporting documentation as applicable.<br>Summary<br>The Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care has an urgent need for a dried plasma product for use as transfusion product or resuscitation fluid to replace coagulation factors for non-compressible hemorrhage injuries, or for related indications. It is hypothesized that a dried plasma product could limit preventable fatalities by reducing logistical constraints associated with currently used frozen plasma products and expanding the availability of plasma in military operations.  The purpose of this program is to support R&D efforts for the development of a spray dried plasma product for use as transfusion product or resuscitation fluid to replace coagulation factors for non-compressible hemorrhage injuries, or for related indications. Milestones may include IND submission, clinical trials, FDA approval, and various field testing efforts.<br>End User requirements<br>a. Ease of use: plasma product must provide maximum ease of use and be easily accessed, re-suspended and delivered.<br>b. Portability: Product packaging must be light, durable and able to handle harsh conditions. No glass bottles can be used to store product.<br>c. Sustainability: Shelf stable - can be safely stored in a sealed container at a room or ambient temperature for an extended period of time.<br><br>If you have any questions please contact Shawn Haubner at<br>shawn.haubner@us.army.mil, or call (508) 233-6167.<br>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information (RFI) <br />for Department of Defense (DoD) Enterprise Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Services</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contracting Office Address:<br /></strong>Defense Information Systems Agency, Procurement and Logistics,<br />DITCO-Scott, 2300 East Drive Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5406</p>
<p><strong>Description:<br /></strong>Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) for the sole purpose of conducting market research and to obtain additional information regarding potential solutions to achieve Enterprise VoIP Service goals. The purpose is to identify possible services available in the marketplace from responsible contractors to the extent needed by the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide a full range of voice related capabilities to over 2.7 million DoD users from central locations that fully leverage the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) and Internet Protocol (IP) technologies. The purpose is to avoid the duplication of costs for voice services, operations and maintenance, network operations, sustainment and information assurance at nearly 2,000 locations worldwide with a lower total cost of ownership. The purpose is to eliminate multiple networks and duplicative services at Base/Camp/Post/Stations (B/C/P/S); centrally locate Video and Voice over Internet Protocol (VVoIP) Local Session Controllers; reduce the footprint of Military Departments (MILDEP) base infrastructure (operation and maintenance (O&amp;M), space, personnel and costs); leverage DISN transport whereby the MILDEPs invest in bandwidth and diversity in lieu of telecom equipment; support migration to centralized secure VoIP and access to Internet Service Providers (ISP) offerings that replace the distributed legacy TDM technology interfaces to the Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN); sustain survivability via regionalization; consolidate and integrate Information Assurance (IA) security and network operations into a single infrastructure; provide enterprise voice conferencing with automatic scheduling, 911 emergency notifications (enterprise and during site isolation from the core), and provide tighter integration with DISA enterprise collaboration and directory services. For tools, the purpose is to identify possible Unified Capabilities product suites in the marketplace available from responsible contractors to the extent needed by the Department of Defense to enable information dominance end-to-end for both fixed and tactical missions. Accordingly, contractors that can provide VoIP services which has been developed and is commercially available, are invited to submit their capabilities information for market research purposes.</p>

What number do you expect to be able to support within the next 5 years. <br /><strong>Q:</strong> Is your solution capable of forwarding a voice session to local attendants when appropriate to meet assured services requirements (e.g., forwarding a precedence call to a local MILDEP attendant instead of forwarding the call to voicemail)?</p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> reduce the footprint of Military Departments (MILDEP) Levels (operation and maintenance (O&amp;M), space, personnel and costs);</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is your methodology and approach to managing EIs and media gateways at the customer edge from the centralized location?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> In support of the reduction in footprint, with an understanding that local COOP capabilities and public safety functions to the PSTN are necessary when the connection to the enterprise is severed, what are your solution components that must remain within the MILDEP?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> Configuration Management is an issue with any complex system. What is your methodology for tracking configuration?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is your experience in facilitating configuration management of a wide variety and large number of assets at sites worldwide?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What are some of the strengths and weaknesses of de-installation and removal as part of a potential solution?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is your recommendation to handle expiring DoD PKI certificates in both end instruments and/or LSCs? Could your solution support centralized replacement of DoD PKI certificates?</p>

<p><strong>(e)</strong> support migration to VoIP and Internet Service Provider (ISP) offering that replace the Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN);</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is your methodology to support centralized access to the PSTN while maintaining public safety (i.e., E911) services on a local level?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is your methodology to work with ISPs to properly route calls to include scenarios where the MILDEP is severed from the enterprise and only COOP dialing capability to the PSTN is available?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is your recommendation to enforce security for sessions transmitted to/originated from an ISP?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> If multiple points of access were provided to an ISP, what is your recommendation to load balance between the various ISP Points of Presence (POPs)?</p>
<p><strong>(f)</strong> sustain survivability via regionalization;</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is your methodology and approach for "failover" from a Primary Enterprise LSC to a Secondary Enterprise LSC? How "service disrupting" is a failover from the Primary to the Secondary LSC?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is your methodology and approach to providing local survivable call processing and PSTN/E911 access capabilities in the event that access to Enterprise VVoIP Services is interrupted?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is your methodology and approach to "Failback" once access to the Enterprise VVoIP has been restored and detected?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> The DoD operates sites all over the world (Europe, Middle East, Pacific Rim, etc).

<p><strong>(h)</strong> government-industry partnering; The DoD desires to develop a healthy long-term partnership in this effort that will be mutually beneficial to all parties.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are typical industry practices for partnering?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is a typical contract structure and pricing arrangement for similar non-governmental contracts you are performing or have performed?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What type of incentives, either monetary or non-monetary, do you believe would be effective to encourage quality contract performance in the areas of system engineering, cost, schedule, and performance?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> Some companies envision themselves as integrators, others as direct service providers. What is your recommendation for a large network such as this? Why?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is industry's standard for length of contract and operations in years for a contract of this type? Example: base contract of 4 years with two 2-year options, or a 2-year base with one-year options, etc. <br /><strong>Q:</strong> What considerations should the Government give to a long-term partnership with industry?</p>

<DESC>A request was received from several companies to extend the closing date for the solicitation by two (2) weeks. Due to the recent process change in determining offers fair and reasonable caused by the DPAP Memorandum dated 14 Sep 2010, 700 CONS internal process requires the contracting officer to decide whether to post solicitations for a full 30 days or whether market research indicates that sufficient responses will be received to comply with the definition of competition in FAR 15. For this project, numerous vendors have indicated interest, but are attending the industry Expo and have requested extensions to the original two (2) week return date for offers. Therefore, doubt exists that sufficient offers will be received without the full 30 day posting that will qualify as competition and the determination is made to allow the solicitation to remain open until the full 30 day posting period is complete. The new closing date for offers will be <br /><strong>Monday 28 February 2011, 1100hrs CEST.</strong>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post Attachment E (router specs).  Please note that the attributes marked as required reflect the minimum functional requirements that must be met.  We are seeking feedback on whether the attributes marked as preferred can be met as well.  Additionally, responders may recommend additional requirements (with no guarantee these requirements will be incorporated into a future Request for Information or solicitation) which would more readily allow for the identification of specific router products.  For example:
1)	Do these specifications provide all the potential vendors sufficient detail to select products of equal capability from your inventory to meet our needs?  If not, please identify the additional characteristics needed.
2)	The VA has attempted to develop subgroups for each of the product area for which specifications were provided.  It is anticipated that in some cases, the VA will require variability in some select attributes within these subgroups for a given product.  Please identify recommended attributes in each product area that will require range characteristics to provide this needed flexibility.
Please submit responses to this amendment only by close of business on April 7, 2011.  Responses shall be submitted to cec@va.gov.
