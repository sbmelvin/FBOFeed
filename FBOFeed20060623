8.  88 CONS H-002 - Delivery Procedures Commercial Vehicles
All vehicles larger than a large pick-up truck are required to be inspected by the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Commercial Vehicle Delivery Gate (CVDG) prior to entering the installation.  Vehicles to be inspected include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Step van/panel truck 
2.  Tractor/trailer, box and flat bed containing cargo
3.  Tanker trucks 
4.  Box trucks
5.  Tour buses 
6.  Garbage/recycled waste trucks
7.  Concrete trucks/mixers, dump trucks
8.  Cranes, recreational vehicles, petroleum tanker 
This inspection will be conducted at Gate 16A located off State Route 444.
The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:
 1.  If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG.  To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers’ names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base.  This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time.  If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours.   All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector.  The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B.  If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access.  
 2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base.   After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B.  The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG.  To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery.  The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.
Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.)  Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.

The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 10, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting all necessary resources to support The Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) Planning Yard (PY) Rotatable Pool (RP) Program.  The Rotatable Pool is a select group of approximately 100 different systems and equipment, the  mission essentiality and high failure rate of which dictate a maintenance philosophy of replacement before failure.  Modeled after similar programs in the Navy Submarine community that have proven highly successful, the RP concept is to maintain a sufficient inventory of ready for issue spares allowing periodic planned replacement. As one item is removed from use and replaced by a shelf spare, the removed unit is sent to a refurbishment facility to be made ready again and put back “on the shelf” as a spare.  Because of the criticality and the high failure rate of the systems and equipment, the ASDS Program requires a quick turn around on repairs and replacements of the systems and equipment.  The ASDS, currently deployed in the Global War on Terror (GWOT), enjoys high strategic priority by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Command Authority.  These services are required to support the ASDS PY and Life Cycle Sustainment (LCS) functions; and for other DSS assets including, but not limited to, USS DOLPHIN, Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS), Atmospheric Diving Suit (ADS), Submarine Escape and Immersion Equipment (SEIE) and Submarine Rescue Chamber Fly-away System (SRCFS).  The solicitation will issue on or about July 10, 2006 and will be issued through FedBizOpps at fedbizopps.gov.    Hardcopies of the RFP will not be available.     Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments.    The proposed contract will have a period of performance of one year and four one-year options, beginning on date of award through 365 days thereafter with four successive twelve month option periods.  Upon receipt of a solicitation package, questions and comments will be accepted and may be sent via regular mail, e-mail, or fax to the primary point of contact in this announcement.     Questions and comments will be taken into consideration and incorporated into the solicitation, where appropriate, via amendments.     NO QUESTIONS or COMMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED VIA TELEPHONE OR BEFORE ISSUANCE OF THE SOLICITATION.   All sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.     See Note 26.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order for the requirement of generation of frozen tissue sample lists.  NINDS has a need to significantly reduce the NINDS frozen inventory of tissue specimens held in 26 ultra-low freezers in long-term storage at Cryonix in Rockville, Maryland.  In order to appropriately and scientifically reduce this extensive inventory of thousands of stored specimens to a small, usable archive for the scientific community, computer lists based on scientific criteria need to be generated that indicate the disposition (save or discard) of each specimen in the collection.  Specific tasks include:    six inventory lists of frozen tissues as follows:  human and animal tissues to retain, human and animal tissues to discard, human and animal tissues of questionable retention.  The contractor will use the specimen records provided by the NINDS.  The period of performance is 12 months.  It is anticipated that 600 hours will be required for this requirement.  The Government intends to select the offer that represents the best value to the Government, price and all other factors considered. Evaluation factors include:  1) Technical approach to the requirements, 2) personnel experience with frozen tissue samples including inventory, 3) past performance.  This Request for Quotations (RFQ) 60041 is due on July 5, 2006 3 PM EST in 1 original and 2 copies.

<DESC>The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency intends to award on a sole source basis a modification to our existing contract that provides interpreting services.  The current contractor is Signing Hands.  This modification will extend the interpreting services both on a full time and intermittent basis, with cleared and uncleared interpreters. NGA is in the process of preparing a solicitation, which was previously announced in FEDBIZOPPS.  Issuance of this solicitation was delayed, which necessitated the need for a modification to extent the current services in order to allow sufficient time to compete the new requirement.  The extension will be through 1 September 2006.  It is anticipated that the solicitation for the new interpreting contract will be issued within the next 2 weeks.   All responsible offerors are welcome to submit a response to this upcoming solicitation.  However, it is unreasonable to compete the extension in that immediate services are required and a solicitation for new contract will be issued in approximately 2 weeks.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No formal solicitation package is available for the extension of services.     However, vendors who believe they have this capability are encouraged to check the fedbizops website for the upcoming competitive solicitation. Award is anticipated 6 days after publication of this notice. Responses received within this time frame will be considered by the Government, but must be in writing    The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The LeVeen CoAccess Electrode System is designed to deliver a consistent pattern of heat throughout the lesion.  An electrode algorithm compensates for tissue variability and has been developed to facilitate complete, homogeneous thermal lesion creation. The LeVeen CoAccess Electrode System, used with the RF3000 Generator, is designed to create consistent thermal lesions for more predictable outcomes. This item is a sharp, polished array tips faciltate tissue penetration.  It is an umbrella-shaped array design promotes stable, accurate deployment.  1cm tine spacing is designed to help create a complete, predictable, spherical thermal lesion.  Continuous  impedance feedback facilitates accurate assessment of complete thermal lesion  dimensions.  1cm shaft makers and echogenic tip help to guide insertion and a choice of length facilitates lesions access.  These items are an urgent request and required for r emoval of tumors.  The LeVeen Needles has shown good results with a similar cases here at Walter Reed Hospital.

All vehicles larger than a large pick-up truck are required to be inspected by the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Commercial Vehicle Delivery Gate (CVDG) prior to entering the installation.  Vehicles to be inspected include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Step van/panel truck 
2.  Tractor/trailer, box and flat bed containing cargo
3.  Tanker trucks 
4.  Box trucks
5.  Tour buses 
6.  Garbage/recycled waste trucks
7.  Concrete trucks/mixers, dump trucks
8.  Cranes, recreational vehicles, petroleum tanker 
This inspection will be conducted at Gate 16A located off State Route 444.
The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:
 1.  If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG.  To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers’ names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base.  This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time.  If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours.   All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector.  The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B.  If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access.  
 2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base.   After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B.  The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG.  To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery.  The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.
Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.)  Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.

<RESPDATE>071406
<CONTACT>Joe Carey, 202-267-5814
<DESC>1.	Description:  This is a Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) and not a solicitation. This is a broad interagency announcement for information on available technologies that may relate to or support air surveillance and network enabled operations for aviation.  The Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (Vision 100, P.L. 108-176) calls for an integrated, multi-agency plan to transform the nation's air transportation system to meet the needs of the year 2025 while providing substantial near-term benefits. This Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) Initiative will address critical safety and economic needs in civil aviation while fully integrating national defense and homeland security improvements into this future system.  (See www.jpdo.aero for additional details). The JPDO has formed Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) to plan out the work that needs to be coordinated to realize the NGATS Concept of Use and its capabilities.  The Shared Situational Awareness IPT is responsible for planning the methods by which information will be shared, discovered, and managed by the aviation community in 2025.  The Air Domain Awareness Subgroup is to ensure maximum awareness of objects within the airspace by comparing cooperative and non-cooperative legacy surveillance capabilities against high level NGATS surveillance requirements to determine gaps, recommend future research and development, and identify integration initiatives and to manage an architecture roadmap from now to 2025.   2.	Scope:  In order to assess potential solutions, particularly products that are either available or under development, interested companies should submit packages of their surveillance and information sharing capabilities and the applicability to aviation.     3.	Focus Areas: a.	Focus area One - Air Surveillance Capabilities, both air-air and ground-air, both cooperative (requiring avionics on board the airborne object) and non-cooperative (will function regardless of airborne object equipage). b.	Focus Area Two - Network Enabled Technology to the extent that it is directly related to air surveillance capabilities, processes, and/or techniques.   c.	Focus Area Three - Aviation Datalink, including Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground data transfer solutions. 4.	Requirements:  The RFI packages should include a description of : a.	Proposed system, equipment or suite of equipment to meet some or all of the focus areas being responded to.  (Companies may respond to any one or all of the three (3) focus areas.  Please provide separate responses for each focus area if practicable. b.	System level description / simplified diagrams of the proposed solution. c.	Recommendation for upgrading and integration current systems to meet transitional requirements. d.	All interfaces among equipment in the proposed system and elements of the aviation system. e.	Capabilities and functionality the system could provide. f.	If available, please include rough-order-magnitude (ROM) cost and anticipated availability of the solution:   1.	Total estimated cost of the project 2.	Estimated cost broken down for each year of the program g.	A statement regarding possible impact, if any, on the environment. In order to streamline the RFI process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a full RFI response, it is requested that the offerors first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation. >From this summary concept paper the Government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Government and whether a formal RFI response would be likely to succeed.     The Government, at its option, may provide comments that might be of assistance to the submitter in determining how or whether to submit a response.  Concept papers will be evaluated as soon as they are received.  Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will not be made, and concept papers will not be returned. The Contracting Office will ask only those offerors with promising concept papers to submit full response to the RFI.  The Contracting Office will notify offerors within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of concept paper if a full response is requested.  Concept papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data.  All proprietary material should be clearly marked. The summary concept paper should state the proposed technical concept including the rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and its contribution to the SSA IPT, Air Domain Awareness initiative.  In addition, the summary concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost and offerors past performance on Government contracts. The concept paper shall be limited to five (5) pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), of English text with one additional page for technical drawing if necessary, and shall be in MS Word for Windows format. No classified data shall be included in the concept paper.  A review of concept papers by the Government will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to merit a more comprehensive information package.  If there is sufficient interest, offerors will be notified to submit a detailed information package for further evaluation.  Concept papers will be evaluated on technical merit and offerors past performance.   5.	Submission Details:  The concept paper should include a one (1) page Executive Summary with the following key elements outlined: a.	Class of technology (e.g., Surveillance, NEO, Aviation Datalink) b.	Maturity of technology 1.	Ready to field 2.	1-3 years to field 3.	4+ years to field c.	One (1) paragraph description of capability d.	Applicability to aviation e.	Brief narrative/description f.	Current government contracts g.	Anticipated cost profile h.	Size and status of business i.	Focal point for additional information 6.

<DESC>Renewal of Service Contract on the Automation Maintenance on the Siemens System 600 Control System
EA133C-06-RQ-0615


SERVICES SOURCES SOUGHT:  The U. S. Department of Commerce, NOAA and the Center for Coastal Environmental Health Bimolecular Research Laboratory (CCEHBR), is issuing an intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Control Management Inc for renewal of a service contract on the automation maintenance on the Siemens System 600 Controls System for the energy management system for all the HVAC and refrigeration sensors and proprietary software.  The Apogee/Siemens system licensed by CMI, Inc. is a proprietary Direct Digital Control (DDC) system for automated building controls, emergency notification and preventative maintenance.  It serves as the central nervous system of the CCEHBR laboratory facility and monitors and controls all critical operating environment parameters.  Any other system would result in redundant features, additional materials and loss of function and efficiency by not having an integral central system for the CCEHBR facility.  Currently, CMI is the original installer of the existing system and they are the warranty holder for all the Siemens/Apogee systems presently in the building, and site license for the existing energy management system proprietary software is also held by CMI.  By going to other contractors, the government would lose their existing warranties on our energy management system and emergency notification system.  This violation of the proprietary contract could have the government remove and install new control boards, circuit cards and software throughout the complete 38,000 square foot building at a cost prohibited expense.  Period of Performance will be September 1, 2006 through August 31, 2007, with four one-year options.  The NAICS code for this action is 238220 and the size standard is $12.0.  This requirement shall be 100% set aside for small business.  


The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source (statutory authority is 41 U.S.C.253(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source).  The company is:  Control Management Inc., 3101 Carlisle Street, Columbia, SC  29205.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to this requirement by July 3, 2006.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.    Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Janie.m.laferty@noaa.gov. Note 22 applies

POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT: The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD), in coordination with the Naval Health Research Center Detachment (NHRC-DET), is issuing this request for information to identify sources and availability of research into the effect, effectiveness, and safety of human electro-muscular incapacitation (HEMI) technologies.  HEMI technologies are sometimes described as electric stun or conducted energy technologies.  Devices based on HEMI technology have demonstrated the capability to produce involuntary behavioral compliance and inhibit voluntary action of targeted subjects.  JNLWD is interested in developing policy and safety standards for consistent implementation and deployment practices across the Department of Defense (DoD).  It is the intent of this survey to gain information which may be utilized to facilitate the finalization of DoD wide policy and safety standards.  Our goal is to determine the actual state of knowledge and research in the field a!  nd/or the research required to develop DoD policy, to map out what is known and what is missing as far as safe use and effectiveness data, to identify potential issues (such as but not limited to product liability issues) and consequences that can impact informed policy decisions and development.  The Government is solely seeking information on the state of HEMI knowledge and planned research from non-government organizations and is not seeking advice or recommendations regarding specific policy development.  The information gathered as a result of this survey may assist the Government’s development of DoD HEMI policy and any supporting actions that must be undertaken.  In addition to the JNLWD and NHRC/DET, representatives from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Institute of Justice shall be involved the analysis and review of survey responses.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS -NO SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS ARE AVAILABLE. Solicitation Number for the announcement is N62467-06-R-0129. Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, solicits from all qualified and interested parties with a priority on 8a firms-first priority and HubZone small business firms-second priority, to replace Hangar 3 Vertical Lift Fabric Doors, at NAS, New Orleans, LA. The NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 236220 - Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The small business size standard is $28.5 Mil. Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 15 percent of the contract work with his-her own employees.  The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions to solicit this project as either a non-competitive 8a or HubZone Small Business or Unrestricted. This project is to replace the existing vertical lift fabric hangar doors on Hangar 3, NAS, NOLA, that were damaged during Hurricane Katrina. The new hangar door system and support framing shall be evaluated, designed and constructed to resist a higher wind load than required by IBC 2003. In addition, the vertical fabric door system shall be designed and tested to resist wind borne debris impacts. The durability and strength of these doors is essential to the protection of assets -aircraft- and operational readiness of the Hangar during and after hurricanes. The primary objective of this project is to provide new hangar doors, which enclose the high-bay area and provide protection from the elements. In addition to enclosing the hangar high bay, these doors should harden this area for storage of aircraft unable to evacuate from evaluation-design. All components shall be designed to withstand both the highest positive and negative wind pressure based on the wind load calculations. To achieve this, the design wind speed shall be 150 mph with an Importance Factor of 1.0. In order to increase the fabric door system’s wind borne debris resistance, a second layer of material - stainless steel mesh reinforced Security Fabric - shall be added to each face - outside and inside - of the entire door. COMPLETION TIME - NLT 01Sep06. Estimated value is approximately $2,500,000. The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements to submit their response of interest to agnes.p.copeland@navy.mil. Responses are to include the company name and title, telephone number, point of contact, and a short statement regarding the companys ability to demonstrate existing/developed expertise and experience in relation to the statement of work. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to set-aside for either 8a or HubZone firms or proceed with full and open competition as Unrestricted. The responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis may be e-mailed, or mailed to the attention of Agnes Copeland at  agnes.p.copeland@navy.mil or mail to Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southeast, Attn. A. Copeland, Code IPT Gulf Coast, P.O. Box 19000, 2155 Eagle Drive, N. Charleston, SC 29419-9010.  Responses are due no later than 30 June 2006 by 4pm local time.

<DESC>The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office (JPO) GPS III Control Segment (OCX) intends to award a sole-source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) modification as a revision to the PRDA contract FA8807-05-C-0013. This modification will add nine months of Period of Performance. This OCX PRDA contract was awarded in July 2005 to increase the U.S. Air Force’s understanding of current technology innovations and capabilities in the area of satellite control segment software & hardware architecture. An additional objective of this OCX PRDA contract was to have the contractor investigate and develop innovative OCX architecture that meets the OCX SS-CS-800 requirements. Under this contract revision, the contractor is to perform risk reduction efforts as described in OCX Risk Reduction (PRDA extension #2) SOO, not to exclude approaches to support an accelerated GPS IIIA space vehicle launch, GPS ground control and space vehicle synchronization, and a smooth low risk operational transition from AEP to OCX. Some prototyping and demonstrations may be of value to the government. Because this action is a continuation of the PRDA contract’s risk reduction activities, this contractor is considered the most capable to provide the follow-on OCX risk reduction activities without the Government incurring substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements (10 USC 2304(c)(1)).  
      
The OCX Program Office is performing a market survey to determine if there are other interested and qualified contractors having the capability to perform risk reduction not to exclude accelerated GPS IIIA space vehicle launch, GPS Ground Control and Space Vehicle Synchronization, and a smooth low risk operational transition from AEP to OCX. To that extent, the GPS OCX program continues to update documents for current and future OCX related contracts, including Draft OCX RFP documents, Phase A, and PRDA extension #2 SOO's. They are being posted on the GPS program library. Access to the library may be requested by contacting Capt. Chad Searle at chad.searle@losangeles.af.mil.

Interested contractors other than the contractor above and those identified in synopsis reference numbers 06-59 and 06-60 are invited to submit a Statement Of Capability (SOC) addressing the ability to satisfy the above requirements to SMC/GPK, Attn: Natalie Tunnell, 483 North, Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808.  All responses are due no later than 07 July 2006 and must conform to 8.5 x 11-inch pages, with font no smaller than 12-point, with a maximum of 20 pages.  The statement of capability must include the following information:  1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact, and telephone numbers; 2) Business size classification (large, small, or other); 3) Experience in the GPS ground control segment or similar systems; 4) Ability to satisfy the government’s requirements; Oral communications are not acceptable. All responsible sources may submit a SOC, which will be considered. Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information or reimburse expenses incurred by parties for responses to this synopsis.

B.  SECURITY FOR SENSITIVE REQUIREMENTS

1.    GENERAL

Performance of this contract requires the Contractor to gain access to sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information.  SBU is unclassified information for official use only.  Contractor employees that do not have a security clearance and require access to SBU information will be given a suitability determination.  Requirements for suitability determination are defined in paragraph 3.0.

2.   CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL

2.1	EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY

The Contractor shall ensure that each employee working on this contract possess a social security card that has been approved and issued by the Social Security Administration.  The Contractor shall be responsible to the Government for acts and omissions of his employees as well as Subcontractor(s) and their employees.

Subject to existing law, regulations and/or other provisions of this contract, illegal or undocumented aliens shall not be employed by the Contractor or perform on this contract.  The Contractor shall ensure this provision is expressly incorporated into any and all subcontracts or subordinate agreements issued in support of this contract.

 
2.2	CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY

DHS reserves the right to deny and/or restrict entrance to government facilities, prohibit employees from assigned work under the contract, deny and/or restrict handling of classified documents/material to any Contractor employee who DHS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive Government information.

The Contractor shall report to the DHS Security Office any and all adverse information brought to their attention concerning employees performing under this contract.  Reports based on rumor or innuendo shall not be included.  The subsequent termination of employment of an employee does not obviate the requirement to submit this report.  The report shall include the employee’s name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported.

2.3	TERMINATION

The DHS Security Office shall be notified of all terminations/resignations within five (5) days of occurrence.  The Contractor shall return to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) all DHS issued identification cards and building passes that have either expired or have been collected from terminated employees.  If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned, a report shall be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to who it was issued and the last known location and disposition of the pass or card.

2.4  SECURITY MANAGEMENT

The Contractor shall appoint a senior official to act as a Security Officer.  The individual shall interface with the DHS Security Office through the COTR on all security matters, to include physical, personnel, and protection of all sensitive documents/material handled by the Contractor.

The COTR and DHS Security Office will have the right to inspect procedures, methods and facilities utilized by the Contractor to comply with the security requirements under this contract.  Should the COTR or DHS Security Office determine the Contractor is not in compliance with the security requirements of the contract, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor, in writing, of the appropriate action that will be taken to rectify any non-compliance to the contract security requirements.

3.0	 SUITABILITY DETERMINATION

DHS shall exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating unescorted government facility and/or access to or handling of both classified and sensitive Government information to Contractor employees based upon the results of a background investigation.  DHS may, as deems appropriate, authorize and grant a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary security checks.  The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation.  The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow as a result thereof.  The granting of a favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such access by DHS, at any time during the term of the contract.  No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Security Office.  Contract employees assigned to the contract not requiring access to sensitive DHS information or recurring access to DHS facilities will not be subject to security suitability screening.

Contract employees waiting for an EOD decision may begin work on the contract provided they do not access sensitive Government information.  Limited access to Government buildings is allowable prior to the EOD decision if the Contractor is escorted by a Government employee.  This limited access is to allow Contractors to attend briefings, non-recurring meetings and begin transition work.

4.0  BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS

Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, requiring access to sensitive information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform on the contract.  The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted.  All background investigations will be processed through the DHS Security Office.  Prospective Contractor employees shall submit the following completed forms to the DHS Security Office through the COTR no less than thirty (30) days before the start date of the contract of thirty (30) days prior to entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, subcontractor employee, or vendor:

a.	Standard Form 85P, “Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions”

b.	FD Form 258, “Fingerprint Card”  (2 copies)

c.	Conditional Access To Sensitive But Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement

d.	Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act

Required forms will be provided by DHS at the time of award of the contract.  Only complete packages will be accepted by the DHS Security Office.  Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of the contract.

Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the US for three of the part five years, the Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation.  In such cases, DHS retains the right to deem an applicant as ineligible due to insufficient background information.

The use of Non-U.S. citizens, including Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), is not permitted in the performance of this contract for any position that involves access to or development of any DHS Information Technology (IT) systems.  DHS will consider only U.S. Citizens and LPRs for employment on this contract.  DHS will not approve LPRs for employment on this contract in any position that requires the LPR to access or assist in the development operation, management or maintenance of DHS IT systems.  By signing this contract, the Contractor agrees to this restriction.  In those instances where other non-IT requirements contained in the contract can be met by using LPRs, those requirements shall be clearly described.

5.0  INFORMATION TECHOLOGY SECURITY CLEARANCE

When sensitive government information is processed on Department telecommunications and automated information systems, the Contractor shall provide for the administrative control of sensitive data being processed and adhere to the procedures governing such data as outlined in “DHS IT Security Program – Publication DHS MD 4300.Pub”.  Contractor personnel must have favorably adjudicated background investigations commensurate with the defined sensitivity level.

Contractors who fail to comply with Department security policy are subject to having their access to Department IT systems and facilities terminated, whether or not the failure results in criminal prosecution.  Any person who improperly discloses sensitive information is subject to criminal and civil penalties and sanctions under a variety of laws (e.g., Privacy Act).

6.0  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING AND OVERSIGHT

All Contractor employees using Department automated systems or processing Department sensitive data shall be required to receive Security Awareness Training.  This training will be provided by the appropriate component agency of DHS.

Contractors involved with management, use, or operation of any IT systems that handle sensitive information within or under the supervision of the Department, shall receive periodic training at least annually in security awareness and accepted security practices and systems rules of behavior.  Department Contractors, with significant security responsibilities, shall receive specialized training specific to their security responsibilities annually.  The level of training shall be commensurate with the individual’s duties and responsibilities and is intended to promote a consistent understanding of the principles and concepts of telecommunications and IT systems security.

All personnel who access Department information systems will be continually evaluated while performing these duties.  Supervisors should be aware of any unusual or inappropriate behavior by personnel accessing systems.  Any unauthorized access, sharing of passwords, or other questionable security procedures should be reported to the local Security Office or Information System Security Officer (ISSO).

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. As a result of accidents, mishaps, and medical emergencies at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, spills of blood and other potentially infectious body fluids have occurred in both indoor and outdoor locations around the Base. These spills of potentially infectious materials need to be expeditiously cleaned up to avoid risk of exposure to other base personnel and spread of materials to other areas.

Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WP AFB) is located in southwestern Ohio, east of the city of Dayton, and adjacent to the City of Fairborn. It is situated approximately 60 miles north of Cincinnati, Ohio, and 50 Miles west of Columbus, Ohio. The base encompasses nearly 8,200 acres and occupies portions of Greene and Montgomery counties, and is adjacent to Clark County. The base is divided into four areas - Areas A, B, C, and Kittyhawk. Area A is primarily comprised of building complexes. Area B contains a complex of buildings and three runways that are no longer utilized for flying, except occasionally for the Air Force Museum. Area C is primarily comprised of runways and flight facilities. The Kittyhawk area is comprised of entertainment and support facilities for base employees. Areas A and C are separated from Area B by State Route 444 and Conrail railroad tracks. Kittyhawk is separated from Area C by State Route 444. In addition to the defined, fenced in areas of the base, Wright-Patterson also owns property off base, which are primarily housing facilities.

The contractor shall provide all labor, supplies, and equipment needed to perform this work. Appropriate disinfection shall be accomplished using a U.S. EPA registered hospital disinfectant that is tuberculocidal or a 10% bleach solution, which shall be made up fresh just prior to each cleanup. Prior to disinfection, the contractor shall use approved OSHA, EP A, and Ohio EPA disinfectants. Work may involve cleanup of various surfaces including carpet, chairs, equipment, as well as tables, walls, floors, commodes, sidewalks, parking lots, asphalt roadways, etc. All cleanup materials deemed infectious waste shall be properly packaged, labeled, transported and disposed of in accordance with Ohio EP A infectious waste and US Department of Transportation regulations. The following guidelines shall be followed when determining if cleanup materials shall be managed as infectious waste.

<SOLNBR>W81GYE-06-S-0001
<RESPDATE>063006
<ARCHDATE>08292006
<CONTACT>Pat Ingrum, 703-428-3009
<DESC>The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (M-SDDC) is developing performance work statements to support its rail service support requirements.  SDDC anticipates that its requirements will encompass three (3) distinct but interrelated r equirements and hence will solicit separately for Fleet Management Service (FM), In-transit Visibility Service (ITV), and Rail Car Repair Service.  SDDC is attempting through this market survey to identify interested parties that will participate on any on e or all of these procurements when they are solicited.   SDDC requests that all interested parties respond stating their interest to the points of contact (POC) identified herein not later than (NLT) close of business Thursday June 23, 2006.    Disinterested parties need  not respond to this request.  POC for th is action is E. G. Dawson Jr. who may be reached at 703-428-2020 or by e-mail at dawsong@sddc.army.mil A description of each service is provided below.  The Government will in all likelihood reserve the right to make eventual award in response to these solicitations to three individual contractors, award all three contracts to one contractor or  any combina tion of award scenarios that are in the Governments best interest.  The Government does  anticipate that it will award multiple contracts under the Rail Car Repair  requirement. Introduction Mission.  The SDDC mission is to provide global surface transportation to meet national security objectives in peace and war.  With the help of commercial partners, SDDC accomplishes its mission with active duty and reserve military members and Department of the Army civilians stationed around the world.  SDDC manages the following business areas: Surface and Intermodal Container Transportation Services, Cargo Operations, Ocean Transportation and Global Privately Owned Vehicle Transportation.  Fleet Management description of service. Background 	Current Practice SDDC is currently using an outsourced solution for management of the Defense Freight Railway Interchange Fleet (DFRIF) (reporting marks DODX) as an integrated part of a contract for fleet management, in transit visibility (ITV) and car repair services.   Anticipated new requirement With respect to fleet management, SDDC expects that the Contractor will become a force multiplier by providing centralized car demand forecasting capability, visibility of available equipment, and control over the matching of available equipment with emp ty car orders. Efficient fleet management and utilization of the existing car fleet, both commercial and DODX, is important given the shortage of cars that already manifests itself at times during simultaneous exercises.   In-Transit Visibility description of service. Background SDDC is currently using an outsourced solution for in-transit visibility (ITV) as an integrated part of a contract for fleet management, in transit visibility (ITV) and car repair services. The ITV Contractor is responsible for providing login and password  profiles for all users and maintaining a web site that is user accessible showing rail car status 24/7. Planned Practice  The Fleet Management Contractor will receive requests from car users for empties to load.  It will assign a request number and determine how best to fill the request.  It will order empty DODX cars from the locations holding or receiving them.  It will ord er empty commercial cars from the railroads or other car owners.  It will transmit empty car request information to SDDCs In Transit Visibility (ITV) Contractor.  The ITV Contractor will track all DODX car movements and all movements of commercial cars, l oaded or empty, of interest to the military.  The ITV Contractor transmits car location message (CLM) data on all the cars it tracks for SDDC to the Fleet Management Contractor.  The ITV Contractor will assign and update an expected delivery date (EDD) for  all cars it tracks and will expedite delayed cars.   The Fleet Management Contractor will make arrangements to provide substitute empty cars if the originally designated cars are not likely to meet the required delivery date (RDD) for the empties or are not suitable to load.  The Fleet Management Contracto r, as directed by SDDC or based on guidance from SDDC, will make arrangements with the car holder and SDDCs Contract Shops (Rail Repair Facilities) for DODX cars to be repaired at the shops.  The Fleet Management Contractor will maintain detailed maintena nce records on all DODX cars using repair data provided by the railroads and the Contract Shops. Rail Car Repair Defense Freight Railway Interchange Fleet (DFRIF) The DFRIF is a private car line comprised of all cars purchased or leased by Department of Defense (DOD) components and intended for use in interchange service in North America.  The DFRIF is composed of almost 2,000 flat, tank, box, reefer, caboose, and s chnabel cars. Military Surface Deployment & Distribution Command (SDDC) SDDC is a component of the Department of the Army which, among other duties, is charged with management of the DFRIF.  Like all other owners of private cars, SDDC is a subscriber to the Interchange Agreement. Basic Government Requirement The Government requires the repair services of a number of Contractors to perform scheduled (Preventive Maintenance) repairs, unscheduled repairs, and modifications on DFRIF cars.  More than one Contractor is required in order to provide a geographic sprea d of repair locations and to accommodate surges in car repair requirements. The contractor shall perform repairs correctly, as defined by the current edition of the Governments Preventive Maintenance requirements, manufacturers instructions, AAR Interchange Rules, or government transportation regulations.  Where a choice of corr ect repairs is available, the Contractor shall request clarification from the Government as to which method to follow or outcome to reach.  Correct repairs require that the proper materials be used, applied in the proper manner, by contractor personnel wit h the appropriate certification, if required, and achieving the desired objective. SEQUENCE OF EVENTS  The normal sequence of events for repairs under this contract is as follows: a. Contractor receives delivery order authorizing it to bill for authorized repairs up to a certain dollar amount. b. Government notifies contractor of car scheduled for delivery and reasons for shopping. c. Government delivers car. d. Contractor notifies Contracting Officers Representative of cars arrival. e.   Contractor performs the initial inspection, unless specifically told not to. f.   Contractor prepares and sends the inspection certificate. g.   Contractor prepares and sends the estimate. h. Contracting Officers Representative reviews estimate and emails approval. i. Contractor performs authorized repairs. j. Repeat g through i for second estimate, if necessary. k. Contractor performs final inspection and prepares invoice. l. Contractor submits invoice and accompanying documentation.   m. Contracting Officers Representative approves invoice and submits invoice for payment. n. Contractor requests disposition instructions. o. Contractor ships repaired car.

<OFFADD>Other Defense Agencies, U.S. Special Operations Command, Headquarters Procurement Division, 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL, 33621-5323
<SUBJECT>19 -- Special Operating Forces (SOF) Maritime Mobility Operations and Capabilities
<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is soliciting white papers/proposals for Research and Development (R&D) projects which offer potential for advancement of Special Operating Forces (SOF) maritime mobility operations and capabilities. A formal Request for Proposal (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued. Request for same will be disregarded.

The USSOCOM reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement. USSOCOM provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Technical and cost proposals (if requested), or any other material submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned. It is the policy of USSOCOM to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.         

1.  The following general aspects/topic areas are examples (but not limited to and not in order of importance) of applied research and development in support of SOF combatant craft. (a)  Advanced hull forms having improved ride quality over conventional deep-vee monohulls, low multi-spectral signatures, high payload weight-fraction, high speed in a seaway, and good sea keeping and maneuverability throughout the range of operations. (b) Shock mitigating systems for crew and equipment. (c) Low signature antenna, weapon systems, topside equipments, and hull construction and outfitting materials. (d) Advanced light-weight composite materials with scaleable production processes for large maritime applications. (e) Lightweight ballistic protection materials and designs. (f) High performance diesel engines integrated with high propulsive coefficient propulsion systems. (g) Craft propulsion systems that take advantage of proven and efficient hybrid technologies and/or electric drives. (h) Integrated command, control and shipboard function monitoring systems to support small crew manning requirements and having improved human factors to reduce crew fatigue. (i) Small, integrated, sensors and maritime information/communication systems that provide real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) information and improved situational awareness. (j) Lightweight, integrated, stabilized weapon and threat detection/engagement systems. (k) Small, lightweight, reliable and easily maintained hull, mechanical and electrical systems capable of surviving in a demanding maritime environment.   

2.  The USSOCOM requires a family of combatant craft to meet SOF maritime mobility and operational requirements.  Although the above research and development topics are applicable to a wide range of combatant craft, request that research and development proposals target technology development that support one or both of following specific combatant craft requirements. 

(a) A small, tactical craft with the following general requirements: (1)   Multi-function craft capable of infiltration and extraction and maritime interdiction operations (MIO). (2) Air transportable by a C-130 aircraft. (3) Crew of up to 4 personnel and carry up to 8 passengers and their associated gear. (4) Speed in excess of 40 knots in a Sea State 3. (5) Station keeping capability and maneuverability to perform safe transfer of personnel during ship boardings and maritime interdiction operations. (6) Low multi-spectral signatures for reduced observability. (7) Round trip endurance of 300+ nautical miles at speeds greater than 30Kts. 

(b) A medium range and endurance craft with the following general requirements: (1) Multi-function craft capable of infiltration and extraction, special reconnaissance and surveillance operations. (2) Large payload capacity with the ability to launch and recover a SEAL Delivery Vehicle or combatant craft up to 40 feet in length.  (Small tactical craft requirements noted in paragraph (a) above.) (3) Operating endurance of 4 to 7 days. (4) Operating range of 900+ nautical miles at speeds greater than 25 kts. (5) Able to support up to 22 embarked personnel. (6) Low multi-spectral signatures for reduced observability. (7) Self-defense weapons and countermeasures. 

3.  WHITE PAPER CONTENT:  Institutions having demonstrated research capability and the necessary facilities are invited to submit a white paper. It is not the intent of this BAA for institutions to establish new facilities.

The cover page should be labeled “WHITE PAPER” and should include the BAA number, proposal title, technology thrust areas addressed, and technical points of contact with telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address. This should only be one (1) page. The technical part of the white paper should not exceed four pages of text including appendices and should describe: the research and development objective; the technical approach; related work by the investigator or proposer; anticipated contributions/benefits to SOF maritime surface mobility; a resume of the principal investigator(s) should be appended together with any supporting information, such as reprints, that will assist in the evaluation of the white paper; and an estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for up to a three year effort;. White papers exceeding any of these page restrictions may not be reviewed. IMPORTANT NOTE: Titles given to the white papers/proposals should be descriptive of the work they cover and not be merely a copy of the title of this BAA. 

4.  EVALUATION CRITERIA. White papers, and any follow-up full proposal submission, will be evaluated on the following criteria:  technical merits of the R&D; qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), and availability of facilities to support the research and development; relevance of the proposed research to USSOCOM program priorities and requirements; and realism of proposed costs, and availability of funds.

5.  EVALUATION/NOTIFICATION:  The USSOCOM may use selected support personnel to assist in providing both technical expertise and administrative support regarding any ensuing proposals from this announcement. These support contractors will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information.  Initial evaluations of the white papers will be issued via e-mail notification.  Detailed technical and cost proposals will be subsequently encouraged especially from those offerors whose proposal technologies have been identified through the above-referenced e-mail as being of “particular value” to the USSOCOM. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award.  

5.  AWARD.  All responsible sources may submit a white paper, which may be considered by the Government. Small businesses are encouraged to submit white papers and joining others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. Based upon the evaluation criteria identified in paragraph 4 above, USSOCOM will award single or multiple contracts in accordance with technical priority and funding availability.  

6.  There will be no other requests for proposals or other formal solicitations regarding this announcement. Formal full proposals for competitive review will be requested based on those white paper submissions judged most likely to meet program objectives. Proposal deadline date and format instruction will be provided at that time.  This announcement will remain open for one year from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA.  White papers may be submitted  any time during this period, however to be considered for the initial round of review and possible funding, white papers must be received no later than 24 July 2006.  White papers will be reviewed on a quarterly basis thereafter.

<SUBJECT>Y -- Aircraft Parking Shelters
<DESC>This is a Request for Quote (RFQ) and sources sought request for the following construction project.

1.	This RFQ encompassed two aspects. First, is for eight proposed canopies measuring 65’ L x 55’ W x 22’ H  so as to fit eight fighter aircraft at the NAS JRB Fort Worth, TX.  They will be placed over eight aircraft parking spots on our flight line.  The new parking spots will be spaced 63.5 feet apart and turned 21.5 degrees to exceed the 10-foot minimum clearance from each wing tip to the canopy’s vertical steel beams.  The main taxiway lines must be at least 50 feet from any object.  Construction shall include eight vertical beams made from 6” diameter pre-fabricated rolled steel that are welded to a 12” x 12” steel base plate.  Each of the steel bases are anchor bolted to the flight line parking ramp concrete slab.  The anchor bolts will be inserted through the steel base and fastened with a 1” nut.  A 3.5” diameter horizontal support I-beam will run the 65-foot length of the canopy frame along each side with support braces located in the middle and on top to add strength.  There will be four 55-foot long I-beam rafters spaced 21 to 22 feet apart that are attached to the top of the eight vertical beams to form the main framework of the roof.  On the top of the rafters will be the roofing framework spaced at six foot intervals.  The 80% sunscreen will be bolted on to the top of the framework.  Must be 80% approved sunscreen made of a fireproof synthetic nylon called Textiline manufactured by the Twitchell Corporation or equal.  The canopies must have the ability to be unbolted from the concrete slab and disassembled within a minimum amount of time for assembly in another area if necessary.  The color of the canopy frames will be a light stone color to match the surrounding buildings and the sunscreen will be a desert tan color.

In order to enhance and maintain the current U.S. Department of State's firewall network security posture, these upgraded secure proxy devices are required to replace the current models purchased under 1019-373262. The Department of State recently increased the circuit bandwidth from T3 to OC3 levels.  Based on this change, the current models in use are not sized to accommodate this level of increased bandwidth and would result in system failover and impact network performance, affecting the productivity of OpenNet users.   The content filtering software provides additional protection to the firewall filtering process from new and upcoming HTTP based threats, attacks and viruses. The content filtering software is essential to the State Department's requirements for maximum protection and utilization of the network security infrastructure on and off site. The BlueCoat appliances were incorporated into the firewall infrastructure in 2003 to replace devices that were no longer supported by the manufacturer and satisfied the Departments requirements for maximum protection and utilization.  At that time, the BlueCoat and various other devices were evaluated and it was determined that the BlueCoats were compatible and could be easily integrated into the firewall infrastructure already in place. Currently, there are other HTTP Content Filtering devices on the market that could be purchased, however to do so would require the department to replace additional equipment needlessly.

ISSUANCE DATE	:	June 23, 2006
CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED
FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS	:	July 17, 2006 at 3:00 in the afternoon, Manila time.
POSITION TITLE	:	MCC Threshold Country Program (MCC TCP) Advisor 
MARKET VALUE	:	GS 15 ($91,507 - $118,957)
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE	:	o/a August 15, 2006 ¡V August 14, 2008, with possible extension
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE	:	Manila, Philippines
SECURITY ACCESS	:	Secret Clearance
AREA OF CONSIDERATION	:	U.S. Citizens
JOB DESCRIPTION	:	See below.

A.	BACKGROUND

The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) was conceived in 2002 to provide development assistance to those countries that rule justly, invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom.  The MCA is administered jointly by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and USAID and is based on the following principles:

„«	Aid is most effective when it reinforces sound political, economic and social policies to encourage private capital investment and increase trade;
„«	Development of plans supported by a broad range of stakeholders where countries have primary responsibility leads to ownership of the plan and are more likely to succeed;
„«	Integrating monitoring and evaluation into the design of activities boosts effectiveness, accountability, and transparency of taxpayer resources

The MCC Board decided not to offer the Philippines Compact status, and instead offered it the opportunity to apply for a Threshold Country Program (TCP). The Threshold Program is designed to assist countries that are on the ¡§threshold,¡¨ meaning they have not been selected for MCA Compact funding, but have demonstrated a significant commitment to improve their performance on the eligibility criteria for MCA Compact funding. Threshold Program assistance is used to help selected countries address the specific policy weaknesses.  The GRP prepared a TCP proposal for consideration by the MCA that focused on increasing anti-corruption efforts and improve revenue administration by strengthening Philippine government institutions.  The MCC Board approved the GRP proposal on June 16th 2006 with a grant of nearly $ 21 million which will be administered by USAID.  [The MCC selects countries for Threshold Program assistance based on their demonstrated commitment to meet the eligibility criteria for MCA Compact funding, including improvement of their scores on sixteen policy indicators, based on public information, in the three general categories noted above.] 

General Role of MCC TCP Advisor:  With senior officials of the Philippine government and key members of the U.S. country team, the contractor is responsible for helping the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) to implement the vision they described in the TCP proposal.  In particular, the Advisor will be responsible for cooperating with the World Bank, IMF, and other donors as they jointly develop a fiscal policy reform program, and ensuring that the technical assistance provided the TCP complements this program.  The Advisor will employ similarly close coordination with GRP counterparts to ensure that the inputs provided under the TCP effectively address corruption issues highlighted in the TCP.  The MCC TCP Advisor will play a key role in planning, managing, monitoring and reporting the progress of the MCC-approved Threshold Country Program (TCP), with special focus on anticorruption and public finance development activities.  The Contractor will have primary responsibility for the management and guidance of TCP activities that will be implemented through one or more implementing instruments, including grants, contracts, and agreements with other USG agencies.  If the Philippines improves its performance on the indicators relative to other countries, it may be selected for the MCA Compact Program.  In that case, the incumbent is responsible for helping the GRP develop a multi-year plan for achieving development objectives and identifies the responsibilities of the U.S. and Filipino governments in achieving those objectives.  The MCC Advisor will be responsible for managing a budget of approximately $21 million for activities over a 2 year timeframe.  He/she will oversee a staff of two FSNs in carrying out these responsibilities.  

B.	DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.	Degree of responsibility for decision-making assigned to the position. 

	The MCC TCP advisor will work under the direct supervision of the Chief OEDG and in close coordination with other U.S. Government and GRP officials. He/she will also serve as a senior advisor to the Mission Director of USAID and the Country Team on MCC matters. The work of devising and managing the TCP is considered to be of significant technical difficulty requiring extensive experience including experience in a leadership capacity. The contractor will exercise the authority to make program commitments on behalf of USAID although s/he will not exceed his/her authorities as a PSC as specified in the USAID Acquisition Regulation, appendix D. To carry out the specified duties and responsibilities, the contractor will manage and supervise a senior FSN technical advisor/project management specialist, and an FSN administrative assistant.  

2.	Level of complexity of work assignments. 

	The contractor is responsible for all aspects of the TCP including project management, preparation of scopes of work and contract management, project monitoring, coordination with GRP, MCC, NGOs other donors, and civil society, analysis of effectiveness and recommendations for continued improvement. The Contractor provides professional leadership and direction for a broad, coordinated program that focuses on critical activities and issues in coordination with MCC and GRP officials.  In this capacity the incumbent plans, implements, manages, and evaluates all aspects of the program.  The contractor facilitates coordination and integration of all aspects of the program through meetings, reports, and correspondence. With counterparts, the contractor is expected to identify and analyze issues to determine the causes and scope of underlying problems. 

3.	Knowledge level required. 

The contractor is recognized as the TCP manager and technical/professional expert within the Filipino government and among all stakeholders on TCP matters. S/he serves as a technical resource and advisor to USAID/Philippines, advising on anticorruption and public finance development activities and programs as well as MCC  requirements. The contractor will be expected to be familiar with and draw upon their own education and experience as well as the available research and experience of others in the area of USAID and MCC policies and procedures, and anti-corruption and public finance activities.  

4.	Supervisory Controls  

	The supervisor provides general direction regarding responsibility in terms of broad program goals and objectives.  The contractor independently plans, designs, executes, and evaluates the overall program after consultation with other donors and GRP counterparts and determines the methods and resources for doing so.

5.	Guidelines  

		The incumbent applies knowledge of and adheres to US government equal opportunity and civil rights policies, goals, and objectives in performing his/her duties and responsibilities.  The incumbent promotes the principle of equal opportunity in written and oral communications with individuals within and outside of the work unit by avoiding offensive or discriminatory displays (e.g. posters, pictures), language, or nonverbal behavior (e.g. hand gestures).

6.	Complexity of the work environment/effect on the position¡¦s responsibilities.   

	Work is to be performed in the Philippines with a large number of GRP agencies and offices, many of whom do not coordinate their activities closely, many with differing agendas, and a generally frequent turn-over is staff, which significantly complicates the management of the program.   The incumbent must coordinate closely with contacts in the MCC and USAID in Washington with a 12 hour time difference. The incumbent must be able to communicate effectively despite this difference. In addition, the contractor must coordinate his/her work with the GRP where roles and responsibilities are ill-defined and policy decisions may require the concurrence of many state and non-state actors.  Because of the nature of the work the contractor will be involved in, principally anti-corruption efforts and taxation, and due to the many and varied players involved, the contract must remain sensitive to the working environment and take special care in maintaining a highly professional manner.

5.	Scope and effect of the work performed. 

	The incumbent is considered the technical expert and his/her decisions and plans are considered authoritative. Work is appraised in terms of overall results achieved and strategic objectives met to the extent under the control of the incumbent. The incumbent is directly accountable for the effectiveness of the program. Establishes priorities and implementation plans for the program and continually assess and adjusts them in coordination with ongoing programs from other donors and the GRP. Maintains surveillance of significant developments related to the TCP and prepares analyses of the implications of these developments and recommends program modifications. S/he guides, monitors, evaluates, and provides management direction for the implementation of the TCP, particularly the work of contractors, consultants and grantee. S/he represents USAID and the MCC at professional meetings and conferences.  As a senior US contractor, s/he is expected to actively participate in key decision-making sessions conducted by USAID, the U.S. embassy and other agency representatives within the overall mission. Provides input into decisions affecting programs inside and outside of the incumbent¡¦s purview.

6.	Level and purpose of contacts. 

A key aspect of the position is to build and maintain positive and effective working relationships/contacts with key government officials at the secretary and undersecretary level, other donors, the private sector, and community and civil society leaders.  The purpose of contacts is to ensure activities are well coordinated and part of an integrated reform program that is able to adjust as different issues arise. The incumbent is expected to be able to justify, defend, negotiate, and settle matters involving significant, sensitive or controversial matters including anti-corruption efforts. The Contractor is required to achieve a common understanding among various parties and seek satisfactory solutions that address their various objectives and concerns. S/he handles all aspects of coordination with the MCC itself, including providing reports, feedback, and monitoring on the Threshold Program itself as well as other areas of interest to the MCC. Develops, publicizes, and garners support for the TCP agenda by meeting with other members of the country team as well as other interested parties such as other donors, key officials of other Federal agencies, contractors, members of the academic community, industry representatives, the media, and civil society groups. 

C.	RELATIONSHIPS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The MCC TCP advisor will work under the direct supervision of the Chief OEDG and in close coordination with other U.S. Government and GRP officials. He/she will also serve as a senior advisor to the Mission Director of USAID and the Country Team on MCC matters.

The incumbent follows general guidance provided by the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Chief of OEDG but must be able to interpret U.S. legislation, international agreements, international norms and GRP legal framework and make appropriate inferences for the TCP.   The incumbent also will follow USAID policies and procedures as available in the Agency Directives System (ADS), agency notices, and the U.S. government acquisition regulations (FAR and AIDAR and supplements thereto). 

The incumbent is considered the technical expert and his/her decisions and plans are considered authoritative.

The Contractor will provide direct supervision of one senior FSN position and one administrative assistant position. In addition, the incumbent coordinates the work of and provides conceptual and professional/technical leadership and direction to other U.S. and FSN staff that perform work in support of the TCP.

<DESC>The Air Force Material Command, Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Eglin AFB, FL. intends to solicit and award a Firm-Fixed Price, Brand Name or equal, for the Clandestine Electric Reconnaissance Vehicle (CERV) under contract FA8651-06-C-0293 using the Acquisition for Experimental and Testing Purposes (AETP) authority under 10 U.S.C. 2373(c).  The CERV is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product and is the sole product of American Electric Vehicles (AEV), 707 County Line Road, Suite E, Palmer Lake, CO 80133.   Contract value is estimated at $2M; quantity is 6 prototypes. The requirement is for a serial hybrid capability for an all-electric plug-in vehicle with a combination of AEV proprietary battery components, power management and advanced recharging techniques, lightweight vehicle composites, and an integrated silent drive-train that are the intellectual property of AEV.  There are currently no known mature alternatives to the CERV meeting availability within 8 months; all-terrain capable with a steady range in excess of 200 miles with a full battery pack at a minimum of 40mph.  The CERV incorporates the latest technology to improve weight trade off and battery capability, both in materials and in software management, to further increase performance and range.  The hybrid vehicle will be compatible with current and future renewable recharging methods and can be modified to add a generator/fuel cell technology to remotely recharge in the event that commercial power is not available.  The CERV will also meet size requirements to be air-transported on AFSOC’s CV-22.  Vehicle will carry  up to 4 personnel.  The AEV is currently the only known company capable of delivering 6 prototypes to the warfighter in the required schedule of 6-8 months.  AEV is the sole U.S. producer and distributor of LG Chem’s E-1 battery cell, the heart of the proprietary battery pack. There currently are no other known commercial, cost effective substitutions to the E-1 cell that the CERV (or similar vehicle) can use. The NAICS code is 541710. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNK), Attn:  Brenda Soler, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.     For technical information, contact Mark O’Hair, AFRL/MNAV at (850) 883-2531, mark.ohair@eglin.af.mil.  For contractual questions, contact Christi O’Leary, Contracting Specialist at (850) 883-2678, christi.oleary@eglin.af.mil. See Numbered Note 26.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this notice to the responsible Offeror whose offer meets the required capabilities and considered most advantageous to the Government.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsus / solicitation for services being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service located in Seattle, Washington intends to acquire the service for data entry of vessel logbooks, the period of performance is 10/1/2006 through 9/30/2009.

Statement of Work								

The North Pacific Groundfish Observer Program (NPGOP) is beginning an analysis of the Bycatch associated with groundfish operations in the eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and the Gulf of Alaska.  In order to perform this analysis, vessel logbooks residing with the NMFS Enforcement Division in Anchorage, Alaska need to be keyed into a format compatible for entry into a database format.  Examples of the logbook pages which will be keyed are at: http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/rr/logbook/cvtrwdfl.pdf, and, http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/rr/logbook/cptrwdcpl.pdf.   We intend to keypunch the logbooks from between 2996 and 4872 individual fishing trips.  Each fishing trip will have, on average, between two and five individual logbook pages with three to five individual fishing tows on each page.  Several fishing trips will be included in each logbook.

The data processing company shall provide the following services in the keying of these data:

1.  Periodically provide for a courier pick up and delivery of the Enforcement copy of the vessel logbooks at out offices in Anchorage, AK at 222 West 8th Ave, Suite A41, 99513.  Pickup and delivery will need to follow chain of evidence procedures (a form that is signed as these logbooks pass from one person to another, identifying chain of custody at all times).  Each pickup will be subdivided by NPGOP into job numbers for ease of tracking and billing.  Pickup and delivery will be at the NPGOP field station in Anchorage.

2.  Provide for a locked cabinet/storage area where said logbooks reside while not actively being keyed.

3.  Resolve questions regarding entries or format before keying data.

4.  Key data in the format provided by the NPGOP.

5.  Key data as it is entered on the form without altering or marking the original data sheet.

6.  Perform true double-keyed entry.  In other words, each page or group of pages is keyed in their entirety by one individual and then are keyed later by a second individual using a program that compares each keyed character and stops whenever a mismatch is found.  The second keyer ascertains the correct value, keys it and continues the process.  Any errors are to be re-keyed without charge.  Undecipherable characters are to be marked on the page with a sticky note, the character (or group of characters) is skipped and keying continues.  Pages with undecipherable characters are pointed out to designated NPGOP staff members.  If the number of pages with undecipherable characters becomes excessively large an alternative method will need to be followed.

7.  Create one or more csv files as specified for each job number and provide it in electronic format as specified in advance by NPGOP personnel.   

8.  Prepare a backup copy of each job number and keep it on file for three months after date of delivery.

9.  Return the completed data sheets and provide the electronic csv files within one month of the pickup date. 

10.  Keep records of data flow by job number, recording pickup date and return date.

11.  Provide the NPGOP with the phone number, e-mail address and fax number of the person(s) who can be contacted regarding pickup and delivery of logbooks, keying errors, and any other concerns about the data.

12. These logbook pages and resulting keyed data are confidential.  The said data processing company will need to sign and abide by a confidentiality agreement and will need to follow evidence tracking procedures.  

13. All work associated with these logbook pages will be performed at the data processing company’s place of business and pickup and return of logbooks will occur without any secondary stops along the way.  Logbooks will be maintained at the place of business.

14. A test csv file will be provided to NPGOP prior to production keypunching to ensure the format is acceptable.

Logbooks associated with this project are still being submitted.  In order to allow adequate time to develop and test a workable keying format and to enable the keying of as many logbooks as possible, we request that the time frame of this project be for three years.


All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.


                         ** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **

Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the Wage and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes, prospective wage rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only upon such contingencies as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage determination, incorporation of the wage determination in the contract, adjusting the contract price, etc."  (The relevant CBA section) in the collective bargaining agreement between (the parties) contains contingency language that Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting "arm's length negotiation" under section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a) of the regulations.  This wage determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage rates and fringe benefits paid under the predecessor contract.

Source of Occupational Title and Descriptions:

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations," Fourth Edition, January 1993, as amended by the Third Supplement, dated March 1997, unless otherwise indicated.  This publication may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, at 202-783-3238, or by writing to the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.  Copies of specific job descriptions may also be obtained from the appropriate contracting officer.
REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:
1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Request for Quotes (RFQ) under FAR Subpart 13.5.  are sought.  This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.

The United States Department of Agriculture, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service[ ], has a need for Subject Indexing as specified below:

The government, at its option, may request correction or modi¬fica¬tion of one or more indexed projects by the contractor if it is determined by the reviewer that contractor indexing is deficient as measured by one or more of the following criteria:

1.	If more than one (1) indexing term per every ten (10) projects is consid¬ered to be any of the following:

a.	Inappropriate for retrieval
b.	Irrelevant

<RESPDATE>071406
<ARCHDATE>09122006
<CONTACT>Andy Eiermann, 256-876-3841
<DESC>Additional information in response to questions received: 1. ASTM E2446-05 Standard Practice for Classification of Computed Radiology Systems deals with CR (Computed Radiology) systems and does not apply to this solicitation. E2339-04 Standard Practi ce for Digital Imaging and Communication in Nondestructive Evaluation (DICONDE) deals with the application of the DICONDE image format. This format is a requirement mentioned in our requirement. 2. The government has determined that CMOS detectors are requ ired to achieve the required 80 Micron resolution. The government uses amorphous silicon panels and they are not acceptable for this requirement. 3. Concerning Inspection/acceptance: Inspection/Acceptance will be in accordance with paragraph a) under 52.21 2-4 Contract Terms and ConditionsCommercial Items. (Sept 2005) (a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test a ny supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. The Government must exercise its post-ac ceptance rights  (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. 4. Concerning reference to 'penaltie s': During evaluation, only those proposals that meet the technical GO/NO - GO requirement will be eligible for price evaluation. The Government always has the right to refuse acceptance of non-conforming goods. If the contractor cannot tender/produce a co nforming good, e.g. 80 Micron resolution, the Government may exercise its termination rights under the contract. 5. Concerning Linear Accelerator: This acquisition utilizes performance based specifications, not government directed specifications. It is not  the government's intent to define how a vendor should propose, but rather to state performance requirements and allow the prospective vendors to offer proposals.  Options could be offered. Government test objects are not adversely effected by EMI and RF f ields. The proposed system is to be installed in a operating 9 MeV x-ray facility. The 1-2T quality level is from a film standard. The requirement is to produce detailed images through the equivalent density of 54 inches of solid propellant. The Spatial re solution is to be 80 microns. The proposed system is to be installed into an existing 9 MeV x-ray facility. The ambient temperature in the facility is 70 degrees plus or minus 18 degrees F. The relative humidity will be between 30 and 70%. The Government w ill supply all necessary electrical power stable within industry standards. The facility shielding is adequate for 9 MeV x-rays. Any addition shielding required will be the responsibility of the Government. The Government will provide connections to facili ty safety interlocks, alarms, warning lights, etc. The facility is remote and externally generated vibrations should not be an issue. The facility does employ a HVAC system. 6. Concerning Scanner Motion Control systems: The test items will remain in the ho rizontal position and will be loaded and unloaded by existing material handling equipment. Moving the scanner in the horizontal mode may be the best option due to space constraints but is not required. During the vertical scan mode a vendor may chose to mo ve either the scanner or the test item or both. Scanning speed and positioning accuracy are not specified. Spatial resolution required is 80 microns. The test items should be handled as gently as possible. Less than 5 g's should be a safe level. 7. There i s interest in developing CT capability.
