<DESC>This announcement is the annual synopsis for requirements falling under the scope of the Enhanced Army Global Logistics Enterprise (EAGLE) program. This annual synopsis covers requirements related to Army Materiel Maintenance Services, Retail/Wholesale Supply Services, or Transportation Support Services that fall within the scope of, and are designated for performance under, the EAGLE program and which emerge within the year after this annual synopsis is published, including but not limited to, the requirements specifically identified herein.
<p>The Army Contracting Command, Rock Island intends to issue a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Request for Proposal (RFP) (Step 2 of the three-step procurement process) applicable for all EAGLE task order requirements emerging this year. Any responsible source may submit a proposal in response to the BOA RFP. The BOA RFP will result in the execution of BOAs with Offerors determined to be technically acceptable in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation. Separate Task Order RFPs (Step 3) will also be issued for each of the EAGLE requirements emerging within the year; however, the BOA RFP will be the only opportunity contractors will have to obtain an executed EAGLE BOA in order to propose against the subsequent Task Order RFPs. BOA proposals will not be solicited nor accepted, and BOAs will not be executed, at any time other than during the annual BOA RFP, even for those emergent requirements not specifically identified herein; as such, if a contractor would like to have the opportunity to be able to participate in any future EAGLE Task Order that may arise within the next year, it is imperative that the contractor submit a proposal in response to the BOA RFP released subsequent to this synopsis.</p>
<p>The estimated release date of the Step 2 BOA RFP (W52P1J-17-R-0059) is 31 January 2017; the closing date for the receipt of proposals will be identified in the RFP. <br />The BOA RFP will be issued electronically, as will any amendments thereto. Contractors are advised to periodically review FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov) in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued; failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the closing date and time of the BOA RFP may render the proposal nonresponsive and result in its rejection. Questions may be addressed to the EAGLE mailbox at usarmy.ria.acc.mbx.eagle@mail.mil.</p>

This includes, but is not limited to, the following requirements which have already been identified and designated for performance under the EAGLE program and for which the issuance of a Step 3 Task Order RFP is already anticipated (though RFPs for upcoming EAGLE requirements will not be issued until the Step 2 BOA execution process under RFP W52P1J-17-R-0059 is actually completed):</p>

<p>The scope of the requirements and estimated RFP release dates and award dates noted above are subject to change. Once an EAGLE requirement is identified, the anticipated dates for RFP issuance and Task Order award will be posted on the EAGLE website at http://www.acc.army.mil/contractingcenters/acc_ri/eagle/index.html and periodically updated as necessary. The Army will not issue a separate synopsis for each of the EAGLE requirements emerging within the year prior to issuing the applicable Task Order RFP. Task Order RFPs will be issued electronically at http://www.fbo.gov in accordance with FAR 4.5 and 5.201; hardcopies will not be provided, but contractors can download a copy of a Task Order solicitation from http://www.fbo.gov on or after the issuance date.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent that EAGLE Task Order RFPs valued at &le;$38.5M will be set-aside for competition amongst the small business EAGLE BOA holders; however, individual EAGLE Task Order RFPs will identify whether the Task Order is being set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>Some EAGLE Task Orders will require a SECRET Facility Clearance. For those such Task Orders, the offerors (and subcontractors performing applicable tasks) will be required to possess the SECRET Facility Clearance at the time of the RFP closing date, at the time of award, and throughout the life of the contract. The Offeror (i.e. the legal entity that is submitting the proposal and would be identified as the awardee of the contract) will be required to possess the SECRET Facility Clearance itself and will not be able to rely solely on the clearance of a subcontractor; for a proposal submitted by a Joint Venture, the SECRET Facility Clearance must be granted under the name and CAGE code of the Joint Venture itself for it to be eligible for award, regardless of whether the managing partner or all members of the Joint Venture have a SECRET Facility Clearance. Possession of an INTERIM SECRET Facility Clearance at the time of RFP closing date may be sufficient to meet the requirement for some Task Orders, provided that it can be validated by the Defense Security Service (DSS); however, if access to classified COMSEC information will be necessary for the performance of a Task Order, FINAL US Government Clearance at the appropriate level will be necessary to perform upon award. Possession of a BOA will not alleviate the need for the SECRET Facility Clearance, therefore, offerors who plan on competing for the task order solicitations that require a SECRET Facility Clearance will need to obtain the SECRET Facility Clearance via sponsorship from another contractor who already possesses a SECRET Facility Clearance. Eligibility information and requirements can be found at www.dss.mil. A Defense Security Service pamphlet is also provided on the EAGLE website for additional guidance on how to obtain a clearance.</p>
<p>To be eligible for award, offerors must be registered in the System For Award Management at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/sam/.</p>

<p>Both the RRC services for in-house RRC beds and the Home Confinement services for home confinement placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work (SOW) entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, October 2016 (Corrected)" (see attached). Home Confinement services (for home confinement placements) are specifically defined in chapter 10, Programs, of the aforementioned SOW.

This will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract for services with a one-year base period, and four one-year options periods.</p>
<p>The Bureau requires 25 RRC beds and 13 spaces for home confinement and 2 beds for MINT services. The Bureau will entertain any and all offers proposing a minimum of 25 RRC beds. All proposals must provide for home confinement placements in the amount of 52% of the proposed residential beds. Offers proposing less than 25 RRC beds and/or less than the corresponding home confinement placements will not be considered.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Government to award both line items (RRC in-house beds and home confinement placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<p>Both the RRC services for in-house RRC beds and the Home Confinement services for home confinement placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work (SOW) entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, October 2016 (Corrected)" (see attached). Home Confinement services (for home confinement placements) are specifically defined in chapter 10, Programs, of the aforementioned SOW. Additional requirements for these services are referenced throughout the SOW as well. This will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract for services with a one-year base period, and four one-year options periods.</p>
<p>The Bureau requires 85 RRC beds and 42 spaces for home confinement. The Bureau will entertain any and all offers proposing a minimum of 85 RRC beds. All proposals must provide for home confinement placements in the amount of 49% of the proposed residential beds. Offers proposing less than 85 RRC beds and/or less than the corresponding home confinement placements will not be considered.</p>

The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4 Single Source, the purpose for this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to extend the current Voice Switch ByPass (VSBP) contract with Astronics DME LLC of Fort Lauderdale, FL to use the remaining contract ceiling.  This is a fixed price, indefinite quantity contract which expires in February 2017.  This announcement is not a request for proposal or market survey.  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this announcement will be solely at the interested partys expense.  
The VSBP system provides backup to various communications voice switches with emergency access and control over very high frequency (VHF) and ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio receiver/transmitters used by air traffic control personnel at Air Traffic Control Towers and Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities.  The equipment being procured remains unchanged and is supported by the FAAs Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) system.  The Astronics DME LLC VSBP system has completed the FAAs Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) and In-Service Decision (ISD) Review process.  Astronics DME LLC has the technical expertise and production capability to perform this work and meet the required deliveries within the timeframe required, concurrent with forecasted requirements for new systems and expansions of existing systems.  

The VSBP system meets the following requirements:
	Operates independently of existing and new voice switch systems (e.g. ETVS, RDVS, IVSR, NVS).
	Provides direct connectivity between the air traffic controller and existing air-to-ground radio communication equipment for primary frequency(s) assigned to that air traffic control operational position.
	Positive system action by the air traffic controller by insertion of the air traffic controllers headset plug into the VSBP jackbox.
	Provides a push-to-talk signal compatible with the push-to-talk requirements of existing primary air-to-ground radio communication equipment system (both local and remote).
	Provides a transmit and a receive audio path compatible with requirements of existing primary air-to-ground radio communication equipment system (both local and remote).
	Is capable of manual reassignment and connection of primary air-to-ground radio communication equipment system to existing air traffic control position.
	Provides a transparent interface compatibility with the existing air traffic control facility legal voice communication recorder system.

This contract extension will enable the FAA to:

1)	Continue uninterrupted deployment of VSBP systems over the next five years
2)	Continue to provide supply support to over 380 already installed systems
3)	Provide equipment for tailored expansions of presently installed VSBP systems as needed.

The FAA intends to issue a contract modification against Contract No. DTFAWA-12-C-00025.
The contracts ceiling is $8,000,000 and the remaining ceiling will support funding a 5 year extension. The extension period will consist of two (2) 2-year Option Periods and one (1) one-year Option Period.  An increase in the current Contracts ceiling of $8,000,000 is not required to meet forecasted requirements.

Questions concerning this announcement may be submitted not later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Standard time, on 19 January 2017.  Questions must be submitted electronically, to the following email address: Glenn.a.Wilson@faa.gov.

<p>Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.501 (a) (1) (iii) the justification (excluding brand name) will be made available within 14 days after contract award or in the case of unusual and compelling urgency within 30 days after contract award.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-93 dated January 13, 2017.</p>
<p><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</strong><br />The associated NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with size standard of 1,000 Employees.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong><br />The non-competitive determination is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10--Market Research, which indicates that TTPLabtech is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the Dragonfly robot required by the NINDS CBBU and only this brand and model of equipment is acceptable to ensure continuity of science. NINDS CBBU exerpiments with the NHLBI have been developed specifically using this proprietary equipment. As such, only TTPLabtech is capable of meeting the needs of this requirement as only this contractor is authorized and able to provide this particular equipment per the attached sole source letter. Use of any other brand or model of equipment would place existing and future research efforts in jeopardy and risk continuity of science; current research data is based on the Dragonfly software and equipment calibration so use of other equipment would invalidate standardization of longitudinal research study data. Loss of this data would be to the serious detriment of the NINDS mission. Accordingly, only TTPLabtech is capable of providing the required equipment.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice if it is believed that the requirement may be met competitively. .  <br /> <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

We will award Nippon Medical &amp; Chemical Instruments Co., Ltd. as sole source contractor. Nature of this contract is a grant rather than a normal contract. Initially, we tried to make a grant IAW 10.U.S.C. 2358 and 31 U.S.C. 6304. However, we found out that our contract writing system at overseas did not allow making a grant.

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is a component of the Department of the Treasury that designs, engraves, and prints Federal Reserve Notes (FRNs) and other U.S. security products. Currency manufacturing occurs at BEP's Currency Facility located in Washington, DC (DCF). BEP's primary customer is the Federal Reserve Board (FRB).
<p>The Office of Engraving requires specific graphic software to support the Bureau's security document design, digital engraving transition, and digital prepress knowledge base. The Office of Engraving currently uses Adobe Illustrator<sup>TM</sup> (AI), which is an application that creates and manipulates vector base graphics. Though AI has a number of tools available within the standard application, the Office of Engraving requires an enhanced tool set, focused around how BEP picture engravers work, to gain more efficiencies. This enhanced tool set will customize the AI application and take the form of pieces of code called "Plugins" which either add new functionality or alter existing tool behavior to better fit the requirements of the user.</p>

<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Office of Information and Technology (OIT), is seeking market research information for CBP to develop an acquisition strategy to acquire contractor services to perform the Attachment 1 Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, or Request for Quotes. Nor does it constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that CBP will conduct an acquisition for these services. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. CBP will not be responsible for any costs incurred in furnishing this information. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned.<br /><br />All information received resulting from this RFI will be used by CBP for acquisition planning and market research purposes only. Information received will be used for internal CBP use only. However, your response may be releasable to the public under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, and the DHS FOIA regulation, 6 C.F.R. Chapter 1, Part 5. If you wish CBP to consider any portion of your response as "confidential commercial information", you should clearly mark the portion as "confidential commercial information". The procedures for identifying "confidential commercial information" are set forth in the DHS FOIA regulation cited above and are available on the DHS website http://www.dhs.gov/xfoia/editorial_0579.shtm. CBP, at its discretion, may request respondents to this RFI to meet with CBP program and contracting officials and to elaborate on information in their written response. Respondents to this RFI may not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided.</p>
<p>Responding to this RFI</p>
<p>A. Responses to the RFI should include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Name and address of contractor.</p>
<p>2. Name, e-mail address, and telephone number of contractor's primary point of contact for the <br />response.</p>
<p>3. Identify if your company is on any type of Government Wide Contract (GWAC) or DHS Strategic <br />Sourcing Vehicle. If your company is a GSA schedule holder, identify the schedule and expiration <br />date.</p>
<p>4. Size of company providing the response to the RFI (large business, small business, disadvantaged <br />small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, woman-owned small business, or HUBZone <br />small business).</p>
<p>5. Provide a listing of no more than three (3) contracts or task orders that the contractor has <br />been awarded for similar Data Center Equipment Hardware and Software Maintenance Services (can be <br />performing as the prime or as a subcontractor). If the past performance was as a subcontractor to a <br />prime, indicate the percentage of subcontracted work. These services should be of similar size, <br />scope, and complexity, awarded within the last three (3 ) years and include the following information:</p>
<p>i. Contract number, FSS or BPA number, or task order number<br />ii. Agency<br />iii. Period of performance<br />iv. Description of services <br />v. Contract/Task Order/BPA total amount<br />vi. Contract type: (Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Time &amp;Materials (T&amp;M), Labor Hour (LH), Cost <br />Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF))</p>
<p>6. Are there any specific requirements identified in the PWS that could potentially be "re-visited" <br />by the Government that would allow completion of the work at a lower contract price?</p>
<p>7. Please submit a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for the tasks identified in the PWS <br />including labor categories and labor rates. If sufficient information is not provided in the PWS to <br />support a fixed price arrangement, identify what additional information would satisfy your ability to <br />fix price.</p>
<p>8. Based on the requirements in the PWS, what contract vehicle (e.g., Blanket Purchase Agreement <br />(BPA), Indefintie Delivery Indefinite Quanity (IDIQ), or a Stand Alone Contract /Task Order) would <br />you recommend to meet the requirements?</p>
<p>9. a). Are there any issues or questions you have regarding performing the scope of work as defined <br />in the draft PWS attached to this RFI?</p>
<p>b). Do you have any recommendations to improve how the tasks are defined or to help you develop <br />a more comprehensive offer should a Request for Proposal (RFP) follow?</p>
<p>B. All responses to this RFI are due not later than February 3, 2017 by 2:00pm EST. Responses received after this due date may not be reviewed by CBP.</p>
<p>C. All responses to the RFI must be submitted by e-mail only (no telephone calls or letter responses) to:</p>
<p>Donna McMullen<br />ITCD<br />U.S. Customs &amp; Border Protection<br />Email: donna.r.mcmullen@cbp.dhs.gov</p>

<RESPDATE>021617
<CONTACT>Mr. L, Email dtra.belvoir.j4-8.mbx.fedbizops@mail.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />"CLINICAL LABORATORY QUALIFICATION"
<p>Synopsis:<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This notice is for MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY, and in no way obligates the United States Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise make a contract award. This notice is open to all interested parties.</p>
<p>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency intends to execute a sole source contract to establish and support the Cooperative Biological Engagement Program's (CBEP) Clinical Laboratory "Qualification" Program in a partnership-like arrangement with a leader in the international clinical laboratory community that issues recognized international certifications that carry value, beyond the CBEP program, to CBEP's overseas clinical laboratory partners. This RFI is being issued to determine if there are other qualified sources.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>CBEP aims to restructure its training program according to a measurable, goal-oriented framework that is internationally recognizable and endorsed, and to also enable CBEP management to objectively and clearly articulate intent and achievement of CBEP international training programs' goals. To this end, CBEP seeks support from an established, leading clinical laboratory certifying organization to create a goal-oriented training validation framework that defines criteria for trainees' achievement of "CBEP qualification(s)". The provider may also support the modification of a CBEP training curriculum around the established CBEP qualification framework (if/as needed). The provider should not only convey international reputation in the area of clinical laboratory, but also demonstrate experience in performing similar activities in low-resource international settings. The certification/qualification framework should set out measurable goals that can be presented as trainees' attainment of skills and competencies according to international standards. Goals, and milestones achieved toward these goals, should be marked by internationally endorsed "CBEP qualifications" that are defined objectively and consistently. Achievement of a CBEP Qualification should carry value beyond the CBEP program and in the international biomedical community; it should represent an apparent step toward an international achievement that trainees and partner country stakeholders may aspire to.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The organization/provider should be unbiased to the greatest extent possible (ie, non-profit, not an existing CBEP training provider), and be recognized as a central and original source of the certification framework used. The goals set forth by this certification/qualification framework will also become the basis for DTRA management's metrics to evaluate clinical laboratory training progress and proficiencies achieved by training programs funded, and to support decision-making about when a given training program may be considered "complete", and/or gauge whether and when milestone goals are effectively met along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provider will perform the following functions:<br />- Establish CBEP qualification exam criteria and guidelines that are clearly within the framework of, and a step toward international certification by a leading certifying organization with an established reputation for global clinical laboratory excellence. <br />- Develop tests for qualification achievement, including written/computer-based and hands-on laboratory practical components; provider will also be asked to administer some or all of these tests under their "name brand" as appreciated in the international clinical community<br />- If/as appropriate, communicate to DTRA any additional support needs to administer tests that are not available by the provider (may include reagents, adequately established exam centers, qualified expert panels, etc.)<br />- Endorse and brand these qualification criteria as the internationally recognized and endorsed entity, marked by "CBEP qualification" granted to trainees upon successfully passing qualifying exam(s) administered by provider.<br />- Communicate and report progress of clinical laboratory training to DTRA management, according to established qualification criteria.<br />- Modify and/or make recommendations to modify a CBEP training curriculum and/or country training program design that clearly trains to the qualification criteria established.</p>

<DESC>RFI - INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT CONTRACT (IASC)
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</p>
<p>This is a Source Sought Notice.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'s mission is to support our citizens and first responders to ensure that, as a nation, we work together to build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards. FEMA receives its authority from the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), P.L. 93-288, as amended at 42 USC 5121-5207.</p>
<p>After an emergency or major disaster has impacted a community, FEMA ESF #6 services and programs are implemented to assist disaster survivors. ESF #6 (Mass Care/Emergency Assistance, Temporary and Permanent Housing and Human Services) coordinates and provides life-sustaining resources, essential services, and statutory programs to the affected population with a focus on hydration, feeding, sheltering, and temporary and permanent housing. All services and support must include equal access to the whole community, inclusive of people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs, according to the Stafford Act as amended, PKEMRA, the Rehabilitation Act, and other civil rights legislation. Family reunification and the distribution of emergency supplies may also be implemented. During mass evacuations, Mass Care services may also be required to support the displaced population.</p>
<p>This level of support is provided, in most cases, upon request of the state, when the needs of disaster survivors exceed local, state, tribal, territorial, and/or insular area government capabilities. State, tribal, and local governments have primary responsibility for the delivery of Mass Care to disaster survivors in their jurisdictions. This is accomplished primarily through state-designated government or voluntary agencies/organizations, and staffed by state and local government employees and/or voluntary organization workers. FEMA understands that no single organization can meet these requirements single-handedly. Therefore, contract services will be needed to fill potential gaps and augment state, local, tribal, territorial and NGO response capabilities in both the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS).When resources within a jurisdiction become overwhelmed, FEMA is tasked with developing and maintaining capabilities, and ensuring those capabilities are in place to support and augment existing resources. To meet these requirements, any offeror selected by FEMA must have the capacity to mobilize supplies, trained staff, and other resources quickly and integrate activities with the overall Whole Community strategy.</p>
<p>FEMA seeks to enhance its capability through the integration of private sector contract resources into an overarching strategy to bridge shortfalls between Whole Community capabilities and the projected life-sustaining needs of evacuees and disaster survivors during declared events. This includes support to individuals with disabilities and their service animals, others with access and functional needs, children in disasters, and survivors with household pets.</p>
<p>The Individual Assistance Support Contract (IASC) is intended to improve the quality and delivery of IA program services through the provision of rapidly deployable resources to bridge shortfalls between the organic capabilities of government and NGO stakeholders. FEMA is seeking support for its mission and delivery of ESF #6 Mass Care/Emergency Assistance, Temporary and Permanent Housing Services under an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Mass Care/EA planning is the provision of life sustaining services, assistance and support. FEMA provides this assistance at the request of state, tribal, territorial and local government. This contract also supports temporary and permanent housing for displaced persons. Furthermore, this contract will require the development of appropriate management, training and operational plans to meet these requirements. <br /><br />The following is a list of services required in this contract:<br />1. Steady State and Planning Support Services<br />2. Mobilization and Deployment<br />3. Congregate and Non-congregate Sheltering Services<br />4. Feeding Services <br />5. Distribution of Emergency Supplies <br />6. Evacuee Services<br />7. Reunification Services<br />8. Construction Services<br />9. Staffing Support Services</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 15.201(c) (7) AND FAR 52.215-3. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP), request for quotation, or an invitation for bid. An RFP is not being issued at this time, and this notice shall not be considered as a commitment by the Government to issue a RFP, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This is a Request for Information only.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research and create an early exchange of information with industry to promote a better understanding of possible future acquisitions, and industry capabilities. This RFI invites participation, by soliciting feedback from industry on innovated strategic approaches to the enclosed Draft Statement of Objectives (SOO). FEMA goal is to implement best practices, to improve productivity, gain efficiencies, and realize cost savings in consideration of industry recommendations.</p>
<p>The information provided may be used by FEMA in developing its acquisition strategy. Responses to this RFI should not be construed as unsolicited proposals to - or providing preference in any contracting activity with - FEMA.</p>
<p>FEMA is hereby requesting feedback from industry. Please review the Statement of Objective and provide your questions on the Question Document attached and/capability statements no later than 12:00 pm EST, Tuesday, January 31, 2017 via email to the Contracting Officer, LaShawn Smith at Lashawn.smith@fema.dhs.gov, and Isaac.Chapple@fema.dhs.gov</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network (&ldquo;NICHD Network&rdquo;) has been funded through the NICHD Coordinating Center contract since 1987.&nbsp; The NICHD Network consists of domestic and international clinical sites that enroll study subjects in trials related to preventing and treating HIV infection and its complications in neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women, as well as selected clinical trials of gender-specific manifestations of HIV infection in non-pregnant women.&nbsp; The Network enrolls into trials conducted by the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) network, the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG) funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the NICHD-funded Adolescent HIV Medicine Trials Network (ATN). The Network also has collaborated on clinical trials in the past and could collaborate in the future with the Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC) and the Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA). Domestically, the Network consists of 15 centers, located in 13 cities, in 11 states/territories (including Puerto Rico); there are 14 international clinical trials sites: 8 sites in different areas of Brazil, 2 in Argentina, 2 in Africa and 2 in Thailand.&nbsp; NICHD also supports laboratory-based pathogenesis-oriented research in the context of clinical trials.&nbsp; The Coordinating Center provides support to clinical trials site investigators with special laboratory expertise for the conduct of specialized pathogenesis-based studies in the context of PACTG protocols.&nbsp; The Coordinating Center provides special support to international sites, such as providing specimen transport through a central Coordinating Center contract with World Courier.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network (&ldquo;NICHD Network&rdquo;) has been funded through the NICHD Coordinating Center contract since 1987.&nbsp; The NICHD Network consists of domestic and international clinical sites that enroll study subjects in trials related to preventing and treating HIV infection and its complications in neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women, as well as selected clinical trials of gender-specific manifestations of HIV infection in non-pregnant women.&nbsp; The Network enrolls into trials conducted by the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) network, the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG) funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the NICHD-funded Adolescent HIV Medicine Trials Network (ATN). The Network also has collaborated on clinical trials in the past and could collaborate in the future with the Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC) and the Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA). Domestically, the Network consists of 15 centers, located in 13 cities, in 11 states/territories (including Puerto Rico); there are 14 international clinical trials sites: 8 sites in different areas of Brazil, 2 in Argentina, 2 in Africa and 2 in Thailand.&nbsp; NICHD also supports laboratory-based pathogenesis-oriented research in the context of clinical trials.&nbsp; The Coordinating Center provides support to clinical trials site investigators with special laboratory expertise for the conduct of specialized pathogenesis-based studies in the context of PACTG protocols.&nbsp; The Coordinating Center provides special support to international sites, such as providing specimen transport through a central Coordinating Center contract with World Courier.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Summary Scope of Work:</strong></p>
<p>Excessive leakage is occurring at the monolith 16/17 joint drain and the monolith 37/38 joint drain at Dworshak Dam. Excessive flows of over 1,000 gallons per minute from each of these two drains have been an ongoing problem and flows are increasing. The amount of flow and consistent increase in flow indicates that erosion of the foundation or concrete is occurring. While there is not an eminent threat, this does present a dam safety concern. Repair is necessary before the problem becomes worse. Additionally, repair will decrease long-term pumping and maintenance costs and allow for better monitoring of flows in the dam.<br />Repair work will consist of two major tasks: (1) grouting in the monolith joints and foundation rock to stop the leakage; and (2) reestablishing any foundation drains that become grouted closed. The grouting will attempt to stop the leakage by sealing within the monolith joint and intersecting rock fractures that are causing the flow. Some of the foundation drains may be grouted closed during the work requiring reestablishment of them.</p>
<p>The contractor must possess a minimum of 5 years of experience as with foundation drilling and grouting, operations, commissioning, and as a service provider.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to furnish post-award submittals for Government review and acceptance. These submittals may include your mix designs, mechanical packer assembly, project schedule, equipment list, activity hazard analysis, accident prevention plan, AT-OPSEC procedures and employee pre-screening.</p>
<p>All on-site work shall be performed in accordance with the Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual (EM 385-1-1).</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to perform the on-site work in compliance with Government Safe Clearance/Hazardous Energy Control Procedures. Prior to commencing on-site work, the contractor will be required to complete applicable safe clearance training for all personnel working in areas involved with Hazardous Energy Control.</p>
<p>The project will involve the development and management of Contractor furnished submittals for items such as product data, test reports, and contract close-out documentation as required by the technical specifications of the contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to use the Government-furnished Construction Contractor Module (referred to as QCS) of the Resident Management System (RMS) to record, maintain, and submit information throughout the contract period. QCS is a Windows-based program that can be run on a stand-alone personal computer or on a network. The Government will make the QCS software available to the Contractor after contract award.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be executing this work in close coordination with Dworshak project staff during concurrent Government operations and maintenance work within and around dam inspection galleries.</p>

<p>2. WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH?<br />Program Executive Office Fixed Wing (PEO-FW), in conjunction with technical experts from Government Labs, program offices and Special Operation Forces (SOF) users are looking to investigate and explore what is in the realm of the possible as it pertains to the topic of automated aircraft route replanning. This includes route replanning for all PEO-FW SOF aviation platforms. Solutions need to be able to address:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide the capability to plan multiple routes for crew selection based on the following:<br />o Aircraft performance characteristics (turn rate, climb rate, etc.)<br />o Aircraft present position<br />o Fuel consumption<br />o Time on target<br />o Threat exposure/defensive system warnings<br />o No-fly zones (with altitude and/or temporal constraints) avoidance<br />o Weather (with altitude and/or temporal constraints) avoidance<br />o Available on-board countermeasures<br />o Predicted hide-ability (based on terrain)<br />o Emergency Procedure Operations (i.e. engine(s) out)<br />o Wind analysis in new terrain<br />o Terrain Avoidance (TA) at low level</p>
<p>&bull; The aircraft route replanner shall provide the capability to plan routes within 2.5 seconds or less. <br />o The aircraft route replanner will automatically provide route alternatives (with warning attributes) when total threat exposure cannot be eliminated or the original time on target cannot be achieved during the replan process</p>
<p>&bull; The aircraft route replanner shall provide the capability to use the aircraft present position and heading as the starting point for the proposed route.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; The aircraft route planner shall provide the capability to interface with Link Capable aircraft to provide near-real time threat and airspace data</p>
<p>&bull; The aircraft route replanner shall provide crew selection of the following route replanning parameters:<br />o Start/end points<br />o Costing weights<br />o Set clearance plane<br />o Input parameters for MSA, ESA, and start climb and have the system generate the parameters for each leg<br />o Reject proposed inputs<br />o Pull current winds/temperatures to update 4D model<br />o Enter climb points for single engine when going through high terrain</p>
<p>&bull; The aircraft route replanner shall be capable of seamlessly operating on the aircraft and off the aircraft (i.e. from mission planning through debrief).</p>
<p>&bull; The aircraft route replanner will utilize open systems architecture, modular design and common hardware.</p>
<p>&bull; The aircraft route replanner should be able to provide multi-sensor data fusion to enhance aircrew situational awareness and accelerate decision-making. <br />o Potential to overlay multiple inputs from a single display<br />o Potential to provide route tracking and data storage</p>

 BACKGROUND
The mission of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is to efficiently and effectively provide benefits and services to Veterans of the United States. In meeting these goals, the Veterans Health Administration, Office of Finance, Managerial Cost Accounting Office (MCAO) ensures compliance with Public Laws, such as PL 101-576, that mandate the use of an activity-based cost accounting system. 
MCAO s Decision Support System (DSS) imports s and processes VA financial and clinical workload information to generate Managerial Cost Accounting (MCA) information for the VA s Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA) and OI&T, as well as, the Department of Defense (DOD) in support of the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center.  DSS information supports the mission of critical VA program offices, including VHA Allocation Resource Center and Office of Patient Care Services, to make funding and resource allocations and facilitates other critical managerial decisions.  
DSS is the VA s only system that provides patient encounter level activity-based costing.  As such, VHA workload data is available at product and patient encounter levels.  
This Healthcare Performance Benchmark project is to enable, and facilitate VHA Managerial Cost Accounting Office MCAO staff to create analogous and appropriate comparisons of VHA healthcare services with private-sector healthcare providers located in the United States.  Work will be conducted primarily by the MCAO staff, with a not-to-exceed twelve (12) individuals.  That MCAO staff will be comprised of highly experienced healthcare performance/cost data analysts and clinicians.  Contactor shall provide:
Access to Robust Private-Sector Healthcare Performance Database of inpatient and outpatient encounters that is historically linear containing at least three (3) of the most recent years.

<p>The NAICS Code for this RFI is 541712.<br /><br /><strong>2. BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>2.1 NTS-3 builds upon 40 years of Global Positioning System (GPS) developments and is expected to help shape the future of satellite navigation capabilities. NTS-1 and NTS-2 were flown in 1974 and 1977 respectively, and these experimental satellites qualified both the rubidium and cesium clocks that form the backbone of today's modern GPS architecture.<br /><br /><strong>3. DESCRIPTION OF INTEREST</strong><br /><br />3.1 The United States Air force is seeking interested parties on an integrated space-based experiment for advanced GPS technologies that are resilient in contested environments. The integrated experiment contains both a space payload and a ground control segment that together increase the resiliency of the entire GPS architecture. The Government is interested in space payload and ground control segment design and fabrication; assembly, integration and test (AI&amp;T); and follow-on support through launch and Government led on-orbit operations. Additionally, the Government is interested in an integrated space-based experiment that achieves Technology Readiness Level 6, via ground testing, no later than 2021 to support a launch in the 2022 time frame. AFRL integrated space experiments are designed for a one (1) year threshold and three (3) year objective on orbit mission life from launch and follow a proto-qualification ground test strategy for launch and space environment compatibility. On-orbit operations are normally performed by the Government.<br /><br />3.2 The ground segment is envisioned to utilize the Multi-Mission Space Operations Center (MMSOC) open architecture standard, as well as the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) for primary direct, secure communications. The Government is specifically interested in ground control segment information tailored to controlling and generating the GPS payload Signals in Space (SIS) as well as advanced capabilities outlined in the objectives below. Information pertaining to MMSOC implementation and spacecraft Tracking Telemetry &amp; Control (TT&amp;C) is not required in the response and should be included only to provide context or illustrate the complete segment. The Air Force is not interested in responses for advanced User Equipment (UE) receiver information at this time.<br /><br /><strong>3.3 Space Payload Segment:<br /></strong>Objectives<br />NTS-3 will experiment with technologies to enable the broadcast of an increased number of signals on L1.<br />NTS-3 will experiment with technologies to improve Satellite Navigation anti-jam performance by overcoming and avoiding jamming while maintaining signal accuracy.<br />NTS-3 will experiment with technologies to counter spoofing.<br />NTS-3 will explore modifications and enhancements to all layers (carrier, code and data layers and sublayers) of the Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) signal to enhance resiliency and improve PNT performance.<br />NTS-3 will investigate assured-by-design technologies to enhance GPS mission resiliency in a cyber-contested environment.<br />NTS-3 will investigate modern processes to manage cyber risks.<br />NTS-3 will experiment with technologies to maintain signal accuracy after loss of contact with the ground control segment.<br />NTS-3 will investigate methods to improve on-board GPS signal integrity detection and notification to users.<br />NTS-3 will demonstrate improved accuracy with advanced clock and ephemeris correction technologies (ground system must be capable of measuring improvements).<br />NTS-3 will demonstrate flying to the ephemeris of an unchanging navigation data message (ground system must be capable of measuring improvements).<br />NTS-3 will measure the space and spacecraft environmental effects on next generation (improved performance and/or improved manufacturability) atomic clock technologies.<br />NTS-3 will investigate antenna configurations to ensure GPS availability and signal strength for terrestrial and space users.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Ground Control Segment:<br /></strong>Objectives<br />NTS-3 requires a ground segment capable of achieving the above space payload segment objectives.<br />NTS-3 will investigate alternate methods to reconstitute the ground control segment in the event of an attack.<br />NTS-3 will experiment with automated/lights-out operations.<br />NTS-3 will demonstrate space vehicle command and control through commercial ground antennas.<br />NTS-3 will demonstrate compatibility with the Enterprise Ground System (EGS) standards and the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS).<br />NTS-3 will investigate modern processes to manage cyber risks.<br /><br /><strong>4. REQUIRED RESPONSE</strong> <br />Reflecting the objectives above, interested businesses are requested to submit a statement of interest on company letterhead to include the following information:</p>
<p>4.1 Describe existing GPS space payload and/or ground control segment capabilities or experience, as well as any partnerships contemplated or required to meet the objectives. This includes government furnished items (e.g. COMSEC or test range support).</p>
<p>4.2 Describe the capabilities and corresponding Technology Readiness Levels (TRL's) of the demonstrated technologies available.</p>
<p>4.3 Describe actual Hardware (H/W) and Software (S/W) including prototypes, engineering models, verification testing and flight heritage of the technologies.</p>
<p>4.4 Estimated time from project inception to TRL 6, including breakdown of time allowed for preliminary engineering, detail design and engineering, proto-qualification build, test, and demonstration.</p>
<p>4.5 Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for the space segment and/or ground control segment broken out by major H/W subsystem/technology or S/W application; please do not provide a full breakout cost proposal.</p>
<p>4.6 Classified responses will NOT be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The Cyber Center of Excellence (CoE) is requesting research papers that address specific areas that answer learning demands or capability gaps that inhibit operational force effectiveness or efficiency. These research papers will be used to assess emerging concepts against documented Army Signal, Cyberspace, and Electronic Warfare capability requirements, inform current capability development and doctrine writing efforts, validate concepts, and better understand DOTMLPF impacts for those concepts under evaluation.
<p>The Army Cyber CoE is looking for government solution providers, commercial vendors, and academic institutions that have interest in presenting research papers to address these signal, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum critical capability needs. The respondent papers will be down selected to find the six (6) top papers by a panel of experts in the requisite areas matching paper topics.</p>
<p>The authors of these six selected papers will be provided the opportunity to present an abstract of their paper during a focused panel discussion during TechNet Augusta, (currently scheduled for 8-10 August 2017). The Army intends to issue invitational travel<br />orders to the authors of the six papers to cover travel expenses. The intended audience and panel will consist of DoD representatives, academic and commercial community stakeholders interested in unique thought, innovative approaches, and/or novel solution approaches to some of the more critical capability gaps and learning demands facing our signal, cyber and electronic warfare community. Furthermore, the intent is to publish these winning papers within the Army Signal Magazine (http://www.afcea.org/content/#) or similar DoD publication.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify industry that the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B).
<p>The Government requirements described below were previously supported by our Global Battlestaff and Program Support (GBPS) contracts until exhausted and then by short-term contracts pending transition to our SOF-Wide Mission Support (SWMS) Group C contract. Due to an extended acquisition timeline and multiple protests, SWMS Group C is not yet available. The contracted services described below are mission critical and this support cannot lapse. As such, the Government intends to issue a purchase order to bridge this critical support for a period of up to 6 months allowing the SWMS Group C contract to be awarded. The purchase order will be issued under NAICS 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a size standard of $15M.</p>
<p>This action will provide Contracting and Procurement Analyst Support. The contract will be issued to SRA International, Inc., 4300 Fair Lakes Ct., Fairfax, VA 22033. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $515K.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all responses received within seven days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A change in the strategy detailed above based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

10. Project Information: A/E IDIQ for Legionella Suppression Design. Work shall be provided for a single 3-year period with the option to extend for two (2) additional 1-year periods.

a. Background:
Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) issued Directive 1061 on August 13, 2014. This Directive addresses the prevention of healthcare associated Legionella Disease and Scald Injury from potable water distribution systems in VHA-owned buildings in which patients, residents, or visitors stay overnight. 

In order to comply with the Legionella Directive, Edward J Hines Jr. Veterans Affairs Hospital is required to implement water treatment and controls upon the existing water distribution system. The new system will include measures to monitor temperature, PH and oxidant levels in each building s potable water distribution systems(s) and scald prevention.

The majority of the utility systems are in need of replacement. Repairs have been implemented to extend the use beyond their useful life. Similarly, spaces for care and administration struggle to meet the changing needs and requirements implemented within the VA systems. Lastly, medical advancements and shifting directives challenge the environment of care throughout the campus. Recent water testing reports have resulted in positive results for Legionella.

b. Requirements:
The awarded A/E will adhere to all codes, standards, guidelines and design requirements found in the VA s Technical Information Library (TIL), including but not limited to the Design and Construction Procedures (PG-18-3), Standard Details & CAD Standards (PG-18-4), Design Manuals (PG-18-10), Design Guides (PG-18-12) and Minimum Requirements for AE Submissions (PG-18-15).

c. Scope:
The A/E firm shall provide professional services necessary for:
 
Preparation of construction plans (drawings), cost estimates and specifications for the installation of water systems monitors for temperature, PH and Oxidant levels in the hot and cold potable water distribution systems. Continuous monitoring of incoming water quality entering building(s).
The evaluation and construction plans and specifications for three (3) options for water treatment modalities:
OPTION A: Copper Treatment
OPTION B: Chlorine Dioxide Treatment
OPTION C: A/E Recommendation

Drawings, specifications and cost estimates shall include all facets of work and trades necessary to facilitate award of a construction contract. Construction period services, to include site visits during construction, are part of the scope.

<DESC>QUOTE SUBMISSION INFORMATION: Quotes can be e-mailed or faxed to the address or number identified above. If you e-mail your quote, page 2 (or equivalent*) must be scanned so we have a signed quote. Alphonso.smith.3@us.af.mil and joe.wells.1@us.af.mil E-mail is the preferred method for offer submission. Your offer shall include but is not limited to the following:
<p>1. Complete (must be signed) Page 2-3 of RFQ (or contractor equivalent*)<br />2. FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications</p>
<p>* The offeror is not required to use Page 2 of this RFQ; however, if you chose not to use it, all of the information on Page 2 must be included in your offer.</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF OFFERS: The evaluation for this acquisition will be solely based on price. The offeror's proposed price will be evaluated for realism, completeness, and reasonableness. Unrealistically low or high-proposed prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating the offer from either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic offer.

<DESC>DLA Energy will utilize the Department of Energy (DOE) Super Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC)<br />Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) to award a Task Order (TO) for the customer's requirement. The DOE Super ESPC IDIQ contracts were awarded to sixteen Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) based on their<br />capability to meet specified ESPC terms and conditions, with a contract term up to 25 years allowed under 42<br />USC 8287. Through ESPCs, prequalified ESCOs finance, develop and implement energy conservation measures (ECMs) for federal agencies at no upfront cost to the installation. The return to an ESCO is a contractually determined share of the energy cost savings generated by the ESPC project. Prior to award of a TO, the ESCO conducts a comprehensive energy audit and identifies improvements to avoid facility energy costs and energy related operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. The ESCO guarantees annual cost savings upon implementation of the ECMs and privately finances the investment. The delivery schedule is amortized to allow the federal agency customer to pay for ESCO services and debt service from annual cost savings over the term of the contract. The DOE Super ESPC IDIQ contract will be used to award a TO to design, install, and operate an ESPC project at Kunsan Air Base (AB), South Korea. The purpose for pursing an ESPC project is to help Kunsan AB reach it mandated energy conservation goals.<br />

<DESC>Notice is hereby provided that the standing solicitation for Multiple Award Schedule 00CORP - Professional Services Schedule (PSS) has been refreshed. 

The new solicitation number FCO00CORP0000C, Refresh #26 replaces solicitation number FCO00CORP0000C, Refresh #25, posted on January 09, 2017 and incorporates additional clauses and provisions to implement the PSS Transactional Data Reporting (TDR) Pilot for the 871 SIN series. 

On June 23, 2016, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) published a General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) final rule to capture transactional data on procurements across all of its Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts and Government-wide Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, to include Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs). The TDR Rule requires vendors to electronically report the price the federal government paid for an item or service purchased through the contracts covered by TDR. To reduce the burden on industry, the Price Reduction Clause (PRC) tracking requirements and Commercial Sales Practices (CSP) disclosure requirements are eliminated for TDR Pilot participants.

For more information on the PSS TDR Pilot, please visit https://tdr.gsa.gov/ OR GSA Interact and review the solicitation attachment entitled PSS TDR Pilot.

Business Consulting & Program Support Services (previously Schedule 874 - MOBIS)

Environmental Services (previously Schedule 899)


PSS contractors can offer information technology related professional services, human resource services, energy management planning & strategies, energy auditing, resource efficiency management (REM) and energy consulting services under complementary PSS SINs when those services are ancillary to the provision of a total professional services solution. Under no circumstances can the complementary PSS SINs be used on a stand-alone basis.

The average site density of the Santa Fe National Forest is approximately 18 sites per section. Site density for the Sierra Nacimiento Restoration (SNR) - Rio Grande Water Fund (RGWF) Cultural Resource Survey Phase II project is estimated as low overall. However, it is recommended that the contractor use outside sources (such as reviews of NMCRIS data and GLO maps) to determine the most accurate site density estimate for the survey areas. The attached statement of work consists of completing the tasks, subtasks and the performance requirements identified in Section 5 of the attached Statement of Work contained within solicitation AG-8379-S-17-0001.</p>
<p>Objectives, Description, Location<br />The Santa Fe National Forest (SFNF), in conjunction with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and contributions from the Rio Grande Water Fund (RGWF), intend to conduct forest restoration and fuels reduction treatments on approximately 2,587 acres of USFS lands. The project area has been identified by the Cuba Ranger District as a high priority area for forest restoration and fuels reduction treatments. The main objective of this project is to complete archaeological surveys so that future restoration treatments can be designed and implemented to reduce the threat of high-intensity wildfire, restore forest function and structure, and make firewood and other small-diameter wood products available to local communities, tribes, and individuals.<br /><br />The project area is located in Sections 31-35 of Township 21 North, Range 2 East; Sections 1 &amp; 12 of Township 20 North, Range 1 East; and Sections 3-9 of Township 20 North, Range 2 East as shown on the Rancho del Chaparral and Seven Springs USGS 7.5 Quadrangles.<br />The project area has a diverse range of vegetation types including: ponderosa pine, mixed conifer, spruce-fir, Arizona fescue montane grasslands, wet meadows and riparian corridors. Unlike other parts of the Jemez Mountains, this area has not seen a recent catastrophic wildfire, but recent forest stand exam data from the project area indicate the forest is heavily overstocked.<br /><br />In order to comply with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, a project survey for cultural resources will be required. A total of approximately 2,587 acres will be surveyed resulting in the report production and data entry using Forest Service Natural Resource Management (NRM) database and Geographic Information System (GIS) Geodatabase. Furthermore, this survey and site documentation shall conform to the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA) Appendix J. Management recommendations shall be based upon the Agreed-Upon Standard Site Protection Measures in Appendix J Sections II &amp; III.</p>

Potential contractors must provide a written response to the evaluation criteria contained in section M in order to be considered for award.</p>
<p>The performance period will begin approximately April 04, 2017.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA</strong><br />FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (October 2014) applies to this acquisition. <br /><br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.	Factor 1: Technical Approach </span></p>
<p>The Contractor's proposal shall address each area of the statement of work requirements in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the statement of work. The proposed technical approach shall include information regarding analysis skills, collaboration capabilities, and teleconference and email communication skills.  The proposed approach shall also be evaluated for creativity and thoroughness of the planned task execution methods, ability to anticipate and address potential areas of difficulty, and ability to integrate new processes and technologies as they arise.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />2.	Factor 2: Key Personnel</span></p>
<p>The Contractor's proposal shall include a resume or curriculum vitae for proposed key personnel. This document shall be evaluated for conformance to the key personnel qualifications, as well as for the size and quality of the record of publications in academic and professional literature and contributions to the field of data analytics, statistical genetics, and neurodegenerative disease.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.	Factor 3: Past Performance</span></p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide at least three (3) past performance references with knowledge of the contractor's relevant skills and experience related to the requirements outlined in this Statement of Work. References shall include the following information:</p>
<p>a.	Name of Organization<br />b.	Description of Contractor's Responsibilities<br />c.	Contact Name, Title, and Telephone Number</p>
<p>Past Performance shall be evaluated for relevance to the current requirement in subject area, anticipated dollar value, and effort duration and complexity. Past performance shall also be evaluated for experience guiding large international collaborative efforts and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Technical proposals will be evaluated using a summary adjectival rating in accordance with the following scale:<br /><br />Excellent<br />The proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes several advantageous characteristics of substance, and very few disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the proposal provides solutions which are unquestionably feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and<br />precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Very Low</p>
<p>Good<br />The proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Low</p>
<p>Acceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect moderate risk in that they may be somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and/or demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Neutral</p>
<p>Marginal<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages present a low or questionable likelihood of resulting in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and/or do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: High</p>
<p>Unacceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has several disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are unlikely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions may also be considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision. Risk Level: Very High</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS SOLICITATION

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The government anticipates a single (all or none), firm fixed price award.  A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier s quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.

VA101V-17-Q-0048

The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-93.

The solicitation is set aside for Service-Disabled Veteran- Owned Small Business concerns only.  The applicable NAICS Code for this solicitation is 511130 and the Small Business Size limitation is $27.5 Million.  This solicitation is set-aside exclusively for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOB) concerns in accordance with Public Law 109-461, Veterans First Program. Only offers from SDVOB concerns that are registered and verified in the Center for Verification and Evaluation (CVE) Vendor Information Pages (VIP) website at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/ at the time date set for receipt of offers shall be considered for award. Offers from SDVOB concerns that are not registered shall be rejected as non-responsive and shall not be considered for award.

The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables as described in the Statement of Work below.  

Description of Requirement

This Statement of Work delineates the various tasks and activities required for a Subscription to a Web-Based Portal that contains financial and Public information for the VA Central Area Office and all Field use to improve such processes for the handling of returned mail, return payments, Vocational Rehabilitation participation and to improve investigations and reporting allegations of misuse of Beneficiary funds.  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables as described in the Statement of Work.   
Part 1. General Information

1. Background: The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Benefits Administration has a requirement for a Subscription to a Web-based portal that contains financial and Public Information, for the VA Central Area Office located at 1800 G Street NW, Washington, DC 20006.

1.2.  Scope of Work: The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverable described in the statement of work (SOW), except as otherwise specified. The purpose of the SOW is to acquire a subscription to a web-based browser in order to obtain current Veteran addresses, credit bureau, criminal history and other public information. With this access VBA employees will increase the ability to quickly and efficiently obtain an address for delivery of returned mail and prevent misuse of beneficiary funds, as recommended by the Office of Inspector General (OIG). In addition, this service will provide information that will assist with return payments and Vocational Rehabilitation participation. This information will reduce the possibility of waste, fraud, and abuse by reducing the likelihood of over- payment and strengthen the internal controls necessary to prevent theft and corruption.  Access to this information will help prevent misuse of beneficiary funds.  Criminal background information is vital to provide better oversight of fiduciaries and meet National Instant Criminal Background Check System relief requests.
1.3. Background: Due to the majority of Compensation and Pension (C&P) beneficiary s now using direct deposit for their benefits, many addresses in C&P s Master Record are no longer current. If there has been no recent reason to send  essential  mail, often the only letter the beneficiary receives is the yearly Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) letter, which is  nonessential  mail.  Guidance has been released, and information included in our procedures manual, that required Regional Offices to utilize a credit bureau reporting company as one of the options to obtain a better address and resend the letter prior to suspending benefits for returned mail. In addition, prior audit reports and investigations by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the Office of Investigation (OI) indicate that the estates of incompetent beneficiaries have historically been vulnerable to potential misuse of funds. These findings are supported by previous OIG investigations, which have resulted in an increased number of fiduciary fraud cases. The intent of the Fiduciary Program is to eradicate the misuse of funds by adequately protecting VA-derived income and estates of incompetent beneficiaries.  One component the Pension and Fiduciary Staff can use to accomplish this goal is a credible system that will eliminate the appointment of unqualified Fiduciaries based on comprehensive background checks.
1.4. Performance Period: The period of performance is April 1, 2017, to April 1, 2018 (base year) with four one-year options. Work at the government site shall not take place on Federal holiday or weekends unless directed by the Contracting Officer.
1.5. Type of Contract:  Firm-Fixed-Price

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As a member of the OTI Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) Team, the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition, stabilization, and conflict mitigation programs, to provide support and guidance for country program staff to help ensure the successful implementation of OTI program activities in the field.</p>
<p>OTI's success now and in the future depends in large part on its ability to achieve an overarching organizational goal: the effective transfer and ongoing analysis of knowledge and experience - comprised of values, management processes, lessons learned, best practices, standards, and innovations - in real time, with a variety of stakeholders. These stakeholders include: OTI staff in the field and headquarters; OTI's implementing partners around the world; USAID Missions overseas; other USAID offices and bureaus in Washington; other U.S. Government agencies and branches; other donors; other transition, stabilization and reconstruction practitioners; host government and/or other local counterparts; and the U.S. public. All of the above increases OTI's level of transparency and accountability.<br /> <br />To this end, the OTI ABC Team supports a model of organizational learning across the office that ensures:</p>
<p>1.	Increased transparency and accountability between the headquarters and field teams;<br />2.	Increased opportunities for peer-to-peer dialogue;<br />3.	Easier access to content and learning resources for a variety of stakeholders;<br />4.	More guidance available in online format;<br />5.	Provision of tools to surface and apply OTI's programming lessons to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of OTI programs.</p>
<p>The M&amp;E Specialist supports OTI's mission to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political transition and stabilization needs by building the knowledge, skills and abilities of OTI staff to continually improve country program performance. The M&amp;E Specialist does this by: designing and providing innovative solutions that are adapted to OTI's fast-paced global needs; developing and facilitating learning and training events; and providing support services ranging from procurement to linkages with private sector partners. ABC supports learning and innovation through the application of technology - including OTI's knowledge management platform, mapping, data visualization, and other analytic tools - to continually improve OTI country program analysis, management and performance. ABC will ensure the effective integration of lessons and knowledge into OTI's learning and training resources. ABC coordinates closely with other units, teams, and divisions within OTI to achieve these goals.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>Tickets shall be recorded and tracked from cradle-to-grave in the DLA ITSM trouble-ticket application.  Work will fall under two main categories:  Incidents and Service Requests (Work Orders)/Tasks.</p>
<p>1.3.8.1 Incidents.  An Incident is often referred to as a "break/fix."  As the term "break/fix" suggests, an incident is used when a user(s) requests support, delivery, information, and/or advice as a result of a failure/degradation in IT equipment/infrastructure.

<p>1.3.8.2 Service Requests (Work Orders)/Tasks.  Work orders/Tasks are generally for standard services when a user(s) requests support, delivery, information, and/or a device which are not a result of a failure/degradation in IT equipment/infrastructure.  Work order requests will describe the work to be performed/accomplished, as well as designate the date the work is to be accomplished.  If a due date is not specified in the work order request, standard Service Requests timeframes apply.</p>
<p>If the work requested by the user/Government requires support/service(s) to be performed by more than one functional area (i.e. LAN, EUS, Telecom, etc.), tasks shall be utilized within the current ticketing system.  In this situation, the work order would capture the overall work to be performed and individual tasks would be created for each functional area to perform their respective duties/work to accomplish the requested work. The level of criticality placed on a work order/task is not predictive of a specific due date.  The criticality is an evaluation of the work to be performed relating to the respective ESA and/or functional areas' missions; classification will be either "Routine," or "Priority."  The Contractor shall anticipate projects that are highly critical to the respective ESA and/or functional areas' mission(s) but may take several days/weeks to accomplish and vice versa.<br />All actions in response to work orders/tasks shall be documented within the work order/task resolution field(s).</p>

<p>Performance measures will be used to assess the Contractor's performance under this contract issued in order to determine whether the Contractor is performing at acceptable levels in order to apply disincentives to contract payments.  Payments will be comprised of the base amount plus a disincentive/incentive component.  <br />The Government will make objective and subjective assessments of the Contractor's performance to determine whether contract performance is acceptable.  The Contractor is expected to perform all functions in a professional manner and prepare accurate and timely documentation. Progress will be tracked based on the milestone event when the Contractor receives a specific tasking.  Performance may vary with the complexity of the acquisition and/or technical document.   The number of completed actions will be balanced against the quality of this output.  It is expected that the documentation and procedures will comply with all major regulatory and process requirements and agency policies and procedures. <br />1.9.2	 Performance Measurements</p>
<p>The performance measurements under this contract shall be based on timeliness and quality of the work and deliverables provided by the Contractor under the contract.  These measurements are defined as:</p>
<p>&bull;	Timeliness - The completion of tasks and/or the submission of deliverables within the schedule set forth by the government during the performance of the contract.</p>
<p>&bull;	Quality - The quality of work completed under the resulting tasks will be measured based on the Government's determination of the validity, accuracy, clarity and usefulness of a deliverable or if the work performance met the expected outcomes as was communicated to the Contractor by the government.</p>
<p>Performance measurement metrics - The vendor's performance will be monitored by the DLA J6 COR/COTRs for each TO using one or more of the following methods of surveillance:  random sampling, 100% inspection, and customer feedback.  The vendor shall perform at full performance; a 100% expected quality- and timeliness- level applies (i.e. meets or exceeds the requirements, no customer complaints).  The vendor is paid 100% of monthly invoice if they meet this requirement.  These findings will be the basis for the amount paid for the task for that month.  The tasks will be rated on the performance of the vendor on the timeliness and quality of the services provided using the adjectival ratings for each criterion as shown below.  For any rating less than "Good," the KO will review the performance documentation and make the final determination for the rating.</p>
<p>Below are the Performance Standards that will be used in evaluating performance in determining the amount of the payment owed to the vendor.  Performance standards and ratings are designed to determine if performance exceeds, meets, or does not meet a given metric and acceptable quality level.  The performance will be rated by the DLA J6 COR/COTR prior to payment.  These findings will be the basis for the amount paid for that period. Note: The application of these performance ratings or failure of the government to apply these performance ratings does not waive any of the government's rights to damages under this contract.  The following overall ratings shall be used:</p>
<p>Good - Performance meets or exceeds contract requirements in terms of timeliness and quality.  The DLA J6 COR recommends and the KO will make a determination to pay the contract 100% of the invoice amount.<br />Fair - Performance meets contract requirements with either only minor performance issues or minor timeliness issues.  The performance or timeliness issues do not adversely impact the mission of the Agency.  The DLA J6 COR recommends and the KO will make a determination to pay the vendor 90% of the invoice amount.<br />Poor - Performance narrowly meets contract requirements by at least one of the following: bordering on unacceptability in terms of or quality of performance, bordering on unacceptability in terms of timeliness, or potentially having an adverse impact on the mission of the Agency.  DLA J6 COR recommends and the KO will make a determination to pay the vendor 80% of the invoice amount.<br />Unacceptable - Performance has been at a less than acceptable level in terms of timeliness or quality.  Possible issues include, but are not limited to:  missed milestones, low quality documents requiring multiple reviews and rewrites, significant or serious complaints submitted by the customers, documents that do not comply with acquisition or policy regulations, or one or more cure notices have been issued.  Payment will be withheld pending resolution of cure notice(s).  Termination for default or cause may result.</p>
<p>The ratings, as described in the table above, will be based on the performance of the vendor on the timeliness and quality of the services provided using the rating scale for each criterion as shown below.</p>
<p>Quality<br />Good	Meets or exceeds contract requirements in terms of quality of work performed.<br />Fair	Performance meets contract requirements with only minor issues and the issues do not adversely impact the mission of the Agency.<br />Poor	Performance narrowly meets contract requirements and either borders on unacceptability in terms of quality, or adverse impact on the mission of the Agency is possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Unacceptable	Quality of performance has been at a less than acceptable level.  Possible issues include, but are not limited to:  low quality documents requiring multiple reviews and rewrites, significant or serious complaints submitted by the customers, documents that did not comply with acquisition or policy regulations or one or more cure notices have been issued by the KO.</p>
<p><br /> Timeliness<br />Good	Meets or exceeds contract requirements in terms of timeliness of delivery.<br />Fair	Minor timeliness issues that do not adversely impact the mission of the Agency.<br />Poor	Timeliness issues that are not minor or borders on unacceptability.

A request for waiver will be considered only after the Government is in receipt of the individual Contractor employee's completed forms, the background investigation has been initiated and favorable FBI fingerprint check has been conducted. The request for a waiver must be approved by the Commander/Director or Deputy Commander/Director of the site. The cognizant DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office reserves the right to determine whether a waiver request will be forwarded for processing. The individual Contractor employee for which the waiver is being requested may not be assigned to a position, that is, physically work at the Federally-controlled facility and/or be granted access to Federally-controlled information systems, until the waiver has been approved.<br />(j) The requirements of this clause apply to the prime Contractor and any subcontractors the prime Contractor may employ during the course of this contract, as well as any temporary employees that may be hired by the Contractor. The Government retains the right to request removal of Contractor personnel, regardless of prior clearance or adjudication status whose actions, while assigned to this contract, who are determined by the Contracting Officer to conflict with the interests of the Government. If such removal occurs, the Contractor shall assign qualified personnel, with the required investigation, to any vacancy.<br />(k) All Contractor personnel who are granted access to Government and/or Federally-controlled information systems shall observe all local automated information system (AIS) security policies and procedures. Violations of local AIS security policy, such as password sharing, performing personal work, file access violations, or browsing files outside the scope of the contract, will result in removal of the Contractor employee from Government property and referral to the Contractor for appropriate disciplinary action. Actions taken by the Contractor in response to a violation will be evaluated and will be reflected in the Contractor's performance assessment for use in making future source selection decisions. In addition, based on the nature and extent of any violations of AIS security policy, the Government will consider whether it needs to pursue any other actions under the contract such as a possible termination. <br />(l) The Contractor may also be required to obtain a Common Access Card (CAC) or Installation Access Badge for each Contractor employee in accordance with procedures established by DLA. When a CAC is required, the Contracting Officer will ensure that the Contractor follows the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 and any other CAC-related requirements in the contract. The Contractor shall provide, on a monthly basis, a listing of all personnel working under the contract that have CACs.<br />(m) Contractor personnel must additionally receive operations security (OPSEC) and information security (INFOSEC) awareness training. The DLA annual OPSEC refresher training and DLA annual INFOSEC training will satisfy these requirements and are available through the DLA Intelligence Office.<br />(n) When a Contractor employee who has been granted a clearance is removed from the contract, the Contractor shall provide an appropriately trained substitute who has met or will meet the investigative requirements of this clause. The substitute may not begin work on the contract without written documentation, signed by the Contracting Officer, stating that the new Contractor employee has met one of the criteria set forth in paragraphs (c), (d), or (i) of this clause, (i.e., acceptance of a previously completed security investigation, satisfactory completion of a new investigation, or a waiver allowing work to begin pending completion of an investigation). Contractor individual employees removed from this contract as a result of a violation of local AIS security policy are removed for the duration of the contract. <br />(o) The following shall be completed for every employee of the Government Contractor working on this contract upon contract expiration. Additionally, the Contractor shall notify the contracting officer immediately in writing whenever a Contractor employee working on this contract resigns, is reassigned, is terminated or no longer requires admittance to the Federally-controlled facility or access to Federally-controlled information systems. When the Contractor employee departs, the Contractor will relay departure information to the cognizant DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office and the Trusted Agent (TA) that entered the individual into the Trusted Associated Sponsorship System (TASS), so appropriate databases can be updated. The Contractor will ensure each departed employee has completed the DLA J6 Out-Processing Checklist, when applicable, for the necessary security briefing, has returned any Government-furnished equipment, returned the DoD CAC and DLA (or equivalent Installation) badge, returned any DoD or DLA vehicle decal, and requested deletion of local area network account with a prepared Department of Defense (DD) Form 2875. The Contractor will be responsible for any costs involved for failure to complete the out-processing, including recovery of Government property and investigation involved.<br />(p) These Contractor security requirements do not excuse the Contractor from meeting the delivery schedule/performance requirements set forth in the contract, or waive the delivery schedule/performance requirements in any way. The Contractor shall meet the required delivery schedule/performance requirements unless the contracting officer grants a waiver or extension. <br />(q) The Contractor shall not bill for personnel, who are not working on the contract while that Contractor employee's clearance investigation is pending. <br />SECTION 3: CLAUSES</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (May 2014) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause.<br />(a) Inspection/Acceptance. <br />(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.<br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.<br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit.

(If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert &lsquo;None'."]<br />(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.<br />(3) Ceiling price.

When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.<br />(4) Access to records.

The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.<br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount computed under paragraph (i) Payments of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours expended in furnishing work not delivered to or accepted by the Government shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this clause, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.</p>

<p>SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS / CONDITIONS / NOTICES TO OFFERORS FOR SUBMITTAL OF SOURCE SELECTION PROPOSAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>1.	Proposal Organization:</p>
<p>a.	The Government will be utilizing a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable process as a means of selecting the most qualified contractor to support the customer requirements for this solicitation.  The Non-Price Proposal shall be submitted in a written format.  The Price Proposal shall also be submitted in writing.</p>
<p>b.	Your proposal shall be prepared in two separate volumes and provided in the quantities shown below.  Non-Price Proposals shall provide information following the technical proposal factors format. Proposals that do not provide the required information in the prescribed format may be excluded from further consideration.<br /> <br />Volume		Title				    No of Copies		<br /> I		Non-Price	       	 		1						II		Price     	      			1				<br /> <br />NOTE: Each proposal shall be submitted electronically in addition to the hard copies. All electronic copies shall be submitted to Deno.Montgomery@dla.mil and John.F.Obrien@dla.mil.<br /> <br />b.	During proposal evaluation, each volume will be reviewed separately.  All cost/price information, if required, shall be in Volume II.  No reference to cost/price shall be included in the non-price proposal.  Each volume shall be separately bound to facilitate evaluation.</p>
<p>c.	Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria outlined in the "Non-Price Evaluation Factors" section of this solicitation.  Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the factors listed in the solicitation.  The rating methodology will be Acceptable/Unacceptable. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria outlined in the "Non-Price Evaluation Process" section of this solicitation.  Pricing will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>d.	In order to receive full consideration, firms are encouraged to ensure that the information provided in the Non-Price Proposal is factual and complete.  To ensure that an accurate evaluation of the proposal is made, please address the factors in the order in which they appear in the solicitation.  Each response shall be titled with the name and number of the factor being addressed.</p>
<p>e.	A proposal will be considered unacceptable for award if it contains deficiencies (or a combination of significant weaknesses that equate to one or more deficiencies) that preclude award of the contract on the present terms of the proposal.</p>
<p>f.	All plans submitted as part of the offeror's Non-Price Proposal are to be followed during contract performance. The Government reserves the right to incorporate into the resultant contract(s) those elements of an offeror's Non-Price Proposal that exceed solicitation requirements.</p>
<p>g.	Offerors may provide additional technical information that will enhance the proposal.  However, overly elaborate proposals that contain information not pertinent to this acquisition are not desired.  Elaborate artwork, expensive paper or bindings, and expensive visual or other presentation aids are neither necessary nor desired. Hasty responses or responses which merely repeat the Performance Work Statement will not be considered as being responsive to the requirements of this RFP. Failure to provide the information requested may render the proposal unacceptable and may lead to a rejection of the offer.</p>
<p><br />h.	If the Government does not conduct a reverse auction, it intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions.  Proposals shall contain the vendor's best terms.  Additionally, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request proposal revisions if it is determined to be necessary.  Proposals shall contain the Vendor's best terms within the proposed non-price and business approach, to include all evaluation factors and sub-factors.  Additionally, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request proposal revisions if it is determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>i.	The proposal must demonstrate to the Government's satisfaction that the offeror is able to provide services that will ensure the successful accomplishment of the stated objectives consistent with the stated performance and technical parameters of the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The Government will evaluate the offerors on the basis of the material presented in the written proposal. However, the Government may use information other than that provided by the offeror in its evaluation, including market research. Proposal information provided for one factor may be used to assess other factors if the Government deems it appropriate.</p>
<p>j.	The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unreasonable in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unreasonably high or low in cost (however cost realism will not be done) when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of technical competence or a failure to comprehend the complexity and performance requirements of the program.</p>
<p>k.	The Government reserves the right to verify any information presented in the Non-Price and Price Proposals.</p>
<p>l.	All contractors are encouraged to utilize the SBA PRONet and SUBNet programs to assist them in obtaining resources to meet the subcontract requirements.</p>
<p>i.	PRONet is an electronic gateway to procurement information for and about small businesses.  It is a search engine for contracting officers, a marketing tool for small business, and a link to procurement opportunities and important information. Prime contractors are strongly encouraged to search PRONet when seeking small business contractors, subcontractors, or partnership opportunities.</p>

<p>FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL</p>
<p>i.	Technical Approach</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's knowledge of the functional and technical expertise of Information Technology End User Support. The Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the top-to-bottom approach (e.g. business functionalities/capabilities) that is required for the operational ability of information systems and applications.

The Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed transition and staffing plan to ensure it has given proper thought and planning to the key elements of starting operations after transition occurs.</p>
<p><br />2.  PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The information required in this volume shall be presented in the format provided in Enclosure 1 entitled "Past Performance Template."  Information for a minimum of two (maximum of 3) projects shall be provided. The offeror shall demonstrate its experience and expertise in providing services similar to End User IT Support. The offeror shall, at a minimum, provide:</p>
<p>a)	A list of 2-3 contracts that the offeror held in the past three years, in which the services of similar scope and complexity were performed. A maximum of 3 referenced contracts with a point of contact information (i.e. phone number and e-mail address) shall be included.</p>
<p>b)	A summary description of the task requirements of each referenced contract.  Reference the similarities of these tasks to those requirements referenced in the PWS.</p>
<p>c)	The total dollar value of each contract referenced.</p>
<p>The Offeror must ensure that information presented for contact points is accurate and current (i.e., current phone numbers, titles, etc.).  The Government will not attempt to "track down" reference data in cases where inaccurate data is presented</p>
<p>i.	 Past Performance Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The Government will contact the points of contact provided by the offeror each project submitted in accordance with the Past Performance Template. Responses received from the points of contact will be used as part of this evaluation process. Evaluation will not necessarily be based only on this information.  Offerors are advised that the Government may use information gained from any source known to the Government (i.e. the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)) to evaluate past performance, provided such information is recent (within the past 3 years).</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. A past performance questionnaire will be utilized to contact references and rate proposals.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's experience and expertise in providing services similar to Information Technology End User Support, to include the overall DoD initiative to provide a common set of tools and services to support information systems throughout the DoD.  End User Support services are essential to many critical systems involving complex and unique setups that require detailed planning and involvement from supported systems. Priority is to ensure continued stable, accurate and reliable service to all current customers.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to this evaluation: 1) the determination of relevance of other contracts performed to the requirements of the solicitation and 2) a determination of how well the offeror performed on these contracts.  These two aspects, when combined, will result in the offeror's performance confidence assessment rating.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR VOLUME II - PRICE FACTORS:</p>
<p><br />PRICING</p>
<p>The price proposals will be evaluated for total price proposed from each offeror. The Pricing Team plans to determine pricing fair and reasonable based on competition in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(i). In addition to competition, in order to ensure a fair and reasonable price, the Pricing Team may use other available price analysis techniques in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b)(2), such as:</p>
<p>-	Comparison of proposed prices to historical prices paid<br />-	Comparison of proposed prices with Independent Government Cost Estimates<br />-	Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained from market research for the same or similar items</p>
<p>The offerors' proposed labor mix and level of effort will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract to the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Offer.</p>

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.

It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to applicable regulations and guidelines.

<DESC><strong>This solicitation is hereby extended to 11:59PM eastern time on January 26, 2017 to provide offerors additional time to submit proposals. The Government intends to post responses to questions received on/or about January 17, 2017. The Government intends to issue an amendment to the solicitation on/or about Jan 17, 2017, which may&nbsp;revise the instructions to offerors and evaluation criteria.</strong><br /><br />1. This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as RFQ NNK17599306Q for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for appraisal services to support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-94. This requirement is a total small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 531320, Offices of Real Estate Appraisers, with a size standard of $7.5 million.
<p>The Contractor shall appraise properties described in individual call orders (e.g. .parcels of vacant land, buildable land, easements, facilities, etc.). The Contractor shall make a detailed field inspection and identification of the various items of the property and shall make such investigations and studies as are appropriate and necessary to enable the Contractor to derive sound conclusions and to prepare the appraisal reports to be furnished under this contract. Upon completion of the inspections, investigations, and studies, the Contractor shall prepare, furnish, and deliver to the Government an appraisal reports in four copies covering said property.</p>
<p>The report shall, in form and substance, conform to the requirements for a complete, self-contained appraisal report as set forth by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP); shall present adequate factual data to support each rate, percentage, or amount used in sufficient detail to permit an intelligent review of the appraisal report; shall relate conclusions to those facts; and shall, among other things, include the items set forth in Special Requirements and individual task orders. A professional, independent appraiser will review prior to acceptance.</p>
<p>2. The period of performance shall consist of a 2-year base, 2-year option 1, and 1-year option 2. NASA estimates that ten (10) call orders will be issued each year. Appraisals under this BPA will vary in price and complexity, although the attached Statement of Work (SOW) (Attachment 1) is representative of potential appraisals to be completed under this BPA. For evaluation purposes, Offerors shall provide a firm fixed price for the appraisal as stated in Attachment 1. NASA will utilize the proposed price and government estimated quantity of call orders per year to establish the maximum value of the BPA. Future call orders under the BPA will be issued based on quotes received in response to the specific appraisal requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, Offerors shall provide a descriptive narrative and/or evidence of:</p>
<p>- A minimum of 10 years of experience as certified property appraiser in State of Florida, to include proper accreditations such as general state certification, knowledge of residential and industrial property appraising practices.<br />- Experience demonstrating the appraisal of large, complex, and government owned properties, such as airports, seaports, industrial parks, etc. Experience demonstrating the appraisal of NASA property and Air Force property, KSC and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) specifically. Demonstrate knowledge and experience in market trends for Central Florida (Brevard, Seminole, Orange, Osceola and Volusia Counties).</p>
<p>3. Evaluation Factors and Basis for Award Determination</p>
<p>a. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government using a lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluation process. After receipt of proposals, the Government will first evaluate the lowest price proposal. If the lowest price proposal is determined to be technically acceptable and otherwise properly awardable, no further evaluations will be conducted, and award will be made. If, however, the lowest price proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable and/or otherwise not properly awardable, evaluations of the next lowest proposal will be evaluated as stated above.</p>
<p>b. The Offerors descriptive narrative will be evaluated to determine technical acceptability. Failure to address and provide evidence of the above elements of technical acceptability may result in the Government determining the proposal as non-responsive. Offerors that meet the following minimum qualifications will be determined technically acceptable:</p>
<p>- The Offeror shall have 10 years of experience as certified property appraiser in State of Florida, maintain proper accreditations such as general state certification, knowledge of residential and industrial property appraising practices.<br />- The Offeror shall demonstrate experience appraising large, complex, and government owned properties, such as airports, seaports, industrial parks, etc. Experience appraising NASA property and Air Force property, KSC and CCAFS specifically. Knowledge and experience in market trends for Central Florida (Brevard, Seminole, Orange, Osceola and Volusia Counties).</p>
<p><br />c. NASA will evaluate the Offerors price quote for the attached SOW to determine the lowest priced Offeror. The quote shall be inclusive of all associated cost elements, to include travel, materials, and other direct cost (ODC). NASA will use the price quote for this sample task to determine the Offeror's total evaluated price. The sample task is provided for price evaluation purposes and issuance of the first call order. NASA will obligate funding for this sample task after award of the BPA.</p>
<p>4. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a BPA without discussions with offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions or seek clarifications if the Contracting Officer (CO) determines they are necessary. In the event issues pertaining to a proposed task cannot be resolved to the CO's satisfaction, the Government reserves the right to withdraw and cancel the proposed BPA. In such an event, offerors will be notified in writing.</p>
<p>5. Applicable Provisions and Clauses are in Attachment 3.</p>
<p>6. Questions should be addressed to daniel.j.heggen@nasa.gov. Telephone questions will not be accepted. Please provide any questions, in writing, no later than January 9, 2017 at 11:00 AM (ET).

<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Battlefield Airmen Branch (BA) is soliciting information to identify sources to provide Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD), production, and sustainment capabilities for Dismounted VDL systems. The Dismounted VDL program was approved to enhance dismounted system capability and to address loss of spectrum, due to spectrum auction. Bandwidths 1695-1710 and 1755-1780MHz were auctioned in L-Band, and bandwidths 2025-2110MHz were expanded in the lower portion of S-Band.</p>
<p>VDL capability improves Intelligence, Surveillance, &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR) essential to close air support, Command &amp; Control (C2), air superiority, target identification, and situational awareness (SA). The Dismounted VDL system's overall concept is to receive, transmit, and display secure and unsecure FMV and annotated images to and from C2 nodes (Dismounted, Mounted, Airborne) via a small, lightweight, ruggedized, and reliable receiver or transceiver. The system will be operator-carried for long durations on limited battery power in a full spectrum of environmental and combat conditions.</p>
<p>Minimum Dismounted VDL Requirements</p>
<p>This system is required to possess Type 1 encryption capability through the use of NSA cryptocore modernization (CCM) and Government approved AES encryption. The Government desires this system to be depot-level repairable. The system must be interoperable with 466ER, Tactical, VNW, FM analog, DDL, STD-CDL and BE-CDL waveforms. The system must support UHF, L-Band, S-Band, C-Band, and KU-Band and support new S-Band frequencies of 2025 to 2110 MHz. The system must be water-resistant and ruggedized. The government anticipates allocating 10 to 15 million dollars to this effort or efforts.</p>
<p>The government is interested in evolutionary increases in capability, as well as reductions in Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP). This may culminate in multiple development efforts and contracts; both for an advanced capability device, as well as for a very low SWaP, receive-only device.</p>
<p>1. In addition to meeting the above requirements, provide a technology development roadmap for Dismounted VDL, for receive-only and transceiver systems, for the next 5 years. <br />2. The system requirements for the transceiver may require networking capability in either a mesh or hub-spoke structure.<br />3. Identify other peripherals envisioned to be necessary to utilize your system?<br />4. Identify GPS capability you can provide within the stated timeline?<br />5. Describe the user interface of any proposed system, including the Web-based graphical user interface, if applicable.<br />6. What improvements in SWaP can you achieve in this timeline, and how?</p>
<p>Sustainment</p>
<p>1. Describe your training concept.<br />2. What is the maintenance concept to include software updates?<br />3. What built-in test/diagnostic capabilities do you envision? <br />4. Describe your approach for repair and diagnostic capabilities of the system.</p>
<p>System Quality</p>
<p>1. What mean time between failure (MTBF) and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) have you achieved in previous similar products?</p>
<p>Capabilities Package<br />The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. The package shall include the following information and address the questions below:</p>
<p>Company/Institute Name: <br />Address: <br />Point of Contact (to include phone number and email address) : <br />CAGE Code: <br />Web Page URL: <br />Size of business pursuant to NAICS Code Insert 6 digit code and title here, size standard Insert size standard here. Based on the above NAICS Code, state whether your company is:</p>
<p>Small Business (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />Women-Owned Small Business (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />Economically Disadvantaged Women-<br />Owned Small Business (Yes/No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />HUBZone Certified (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />Veteran Owned Small Business (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />Service Disabled Veteran Owned<br />Small Business (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />8(a) Certified (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />SBA Certification Date: ____________ SBA Graduation Date: ______________</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement, if applicable to the company's capabilities, should be included in the company's NAICS code listing in SAM.</p>
<p>Is your company domestically or foreign owned (if foreign, please indicate the country of ownership).</p>
<p>Respondents should also state whether they are interested in being a prime contractor for this requirement or a subcontractor.</p>
<p><br />Responses, communications and additional considerations:</p>
<p>One (1) paper copies should be submitted to the program office as outlined below. Respondents shall limit submissions to 20 pages or less and should include technical and descriptive text to provide sufficient detail on production and sustainment capabilities. The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. <br />Respondents who submit proprietary data shall clearly mark the data with appropriate markings on the cover sheet and on each applicable page. Any proprietary data submitted may be handled by contract support services personnel who have signed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA). Any material that is not marked proprietary will be considered publicly-releasable. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. A determination not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government. E-mail copies of the paper submittal will be accepted. Responses shall be received by 4:00pm (est), on 12 October 2015. Paper/e-mail submittals should be sent to the below contacts within AFLCMC/WISK.

<p>The NAICS Code for this RFI is 541712.<br /><br /><strong>2. BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>2.1 NTS-3 builds upon 40 years of Global Positioning System (GPS) developments and is expected to help shape the future of satellite navigation capabilities. NTS-1 and NTS-2 were flown in 1974 and 1977 respectively, and these experimental satellites qualified both the rubidium and cesium clocks that form the backbone of today's modern GPS architecture.<br /><br /><strong>3. DESCRIPTION OF INTEREST</strong><br /><br />3.1 The United States Air force is seeking interested parties on an integrated space-based experiment for advanced GPS technologies that are resilient in contested environments. The integrated experiment contains both a space payload and a ground control segment that together increase the resiliency of the entire GPS architecture. The Government is interested in space payload and ground control segment design and fabrication; assembly, integration and test (AI&amp;T); and follow-on support through launch and Government led on-orbit operations. Additionally, the Government is interested in an integrated space-based experiment that achieves Technology Readiness Level 6, via ground testing, no later than 2021 to support a launch in the 2022 time frame. AFRL integrated space experiments are designed for a one (1) year threshold and three (3) year objective on orbit mission life from launch and follow a proto-qualification ground test strategy for launch and space environment compatibility. On-orbit operations are normally performed by the Government.<br /><br />3.2 The ground segment is envisioned to utilize the Multi-Mission Space Operations Center (MMSOC) open architecture standard, as well as the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) for primary direct, secure communications. The Government is specifically interested in ground control segment information tailored to controlling and generating the GPS payload Signals in Space (SIS) as well as advanced capabilities outlined in the objectives below. Information pertaining to MMSOC implementation and spacecraft Tracking Telemetry &amp; Control (TT&amp;C) is not required in the response and should be included only to provide context or illustrate the complete segment. The Air Force is not interested in responses for advanced User Equipment (UE) receiver information at this time.<br /><br /><strong>3.3 Space Payload Segment:<br /></strong>Objectives<br />NTS-3 will experiment with technologies to enable the broadcast of an increased number of signals on L1.<br />NTS-3 will experiment with technologies to improve Satellite Navigation anti-jam performance by overcoming and avoiding jamming while maintaining signal accuracy.<br />NTS-3 will experiment with technologies to counter spoofing.<br />NTS-3 will explore modifications and enhancements to all layers (carrier, code and data layers and sublayers) of the Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) signal to enhance resiliency and improve PNT performance.<br />NTS-3 will investigate assured-by-design technologies to enhance GPS mission resiliency in a cyber-contested environment.<br />NTS-3 will investigate modern processes to manage cyber risks.<br />NTS-3 will experiment with technologies to maintain signal accuracy after loss of contact with the ground control segment.<br />NTS-3 will investigate methods to improve on-board GPS signal integrity detection and notification to users.<br />NTS-3 will demonstrate improved accuracy with advanced clock and ephemeris correction technologies (ground system must be capable of measuring improvements).<br />NTS-3 will demonstrate flying to the ephemeris of an unchanging navigation data message (ground system must be capable of measuring improvements).<br />NTS-3 will measure the space and spacecraft environmental effects on next generation (improved performance and/or improved manufacturability) atomic clock technologies.<br />NTS-3 will investigate antenna configurations to ensure GPS availability and signal strength for terrestrial and space users.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Ground Control Segment:<br /></strong>Objectives<br />NTS-3 requires a ground segment capable of achieving the above space payload segment objectives.<br />NTS-3 will investigate alternate methods to reconstitute the ground control segment in the event of an attack.<br />NTS-3 will experiment with automated/lights-out operations.<br />NTS-3 will demonstrate space vehicle command and control through commercial ground antennas.<br />NTS-3 will demonstrate compatibility with the Enterprise Ground System (EGS) standards and the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS).<br />NTS-3 will investigate modern processes to manage cyber risks.<br /><br /><strong>4.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the due date, provide changes to Sections C,J and respond to offeror's questions. 

Refer to the Summary of Changes and the revised Sections for details.

The FAA will provide another amendment to answer ALL remaining questions received.

---------------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Facility Security Risk Management Program (FSRM) office has a requirement for security officer services throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Guan and Puerto Rico under the National Security Officer Program (NSOP).  These services are being procured in order to provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, facilities, and United States Government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage and terrorism.

This Screening Information Request/Request For Offer (SIR)/(RFO) is for Security Officer (SO) Services within Eastern Service Area (ESA).  A complete listing of included facilities can be found in Section B of the SIR.  

1.	INTRODUCTION/DESCRIPTION
The Contractor must furnish all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, transportation, training, and management necessary to provide SO services in accordance with the stated requirements. The Contractor must implement all necessary scheduling and personnel and equipment control procedures to ensure timely accomplishment of all SO service requirements.

2.  CONTRACT TYPE AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE 
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with three Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLINs) and one Cost Reimbursable (CR) CLIN and a period of performance of one base year and four one year options with security officer services anticipated to begin on September 30, 2017.  It is the FAAs intention that any new awardee will have an initial three month transition period prior to the security officer services start date.  The FAA will award one contract resulting from this individual Service Area SIR.

3.  NATURE OF COMPETITION
This acquisition will involve the use of streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 561612 - Security Guards and Patrol Services. The small business size standard for this code is $20.5 million.  
Tiered Evaluation: In order to provide opportunities for small businesses and to ensure that FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:

I.	SEDB/8(a) Businesses
II.	Small Businesses
III.	Other Than Small Businesses

(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.

(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.

With the exception of joint ventures, all business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers. Adequate competition exists when two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, submit priced offers that satisfy the Governments expressed requirement. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition.

Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area award but have the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on other Service Area awards without restriction. The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer. Under the first two tiers, Small Business offerors are reminded that in accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting, at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor. AMS clauses may be viewed in full text at http://conwrite.faa.gov.   Under the third tier, in accordance with Section I AMS Clause 3.6.1-4 Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan (August 2012) (c) the offeror, upon request by the Contracting Officer, shall submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan, where applicable, that separately addresses subcontracting with small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. 

Alternate proposals will not be evaluated. In the event a proposal is rejected a notice will be sent to the Offeror stating the reason(s) that the proposal will not be given further consideration.

All responses to this SIR must follow all submission instructions found in Section L of the SIR.

The FAA will not pay any costs incurred in the preparation or submission of any response to this solicitation.

It is the FAAs intention that any new awardee will have an initial three month transition period prior to the security officer services start date.  The FAA will award one contract resulting from this individual Service Area SIR.

3.  NATURE OF COMPETITION
This acquisition will involve the use of streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 561612 - Security Guards and Patrol Services. The small business size standard for this code is $20.5 million.  

Tiered Evaluation: In order to provide opportunities for small businesses and to ensure that FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:

I.	SEDB/8(a) Businesses
II.	Small Businesses
III.	Other Than Small Businesses

(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.

(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.

With the exception of joint ventures, all business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers. Adequate competition exists when two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, submit priced offers that satisfy the Governments expressed requirement. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition.

Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area award but have the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on other Service Area awards without restriction. The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer. Under the first two tiers, Small Business offerors are reminded that in accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting, at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor. AMS clause 3.6.1-7 may be viewed in full text at http://conwrite.faa.gov.   Under the third tier, in accordance with Section I AMS Clause 3.6.1-4 Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan (August 2012) (c) the offeror, upon request by the Contracting Officer, shall submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan, where applicable, that separately addresses subcontracting with small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. 

Alternate proposals will not be evaluated. In the event a proposal is rejected a notice will be sent to the Offeror stating the reason(s) that the proposal will not be given further consideration.

All responses to this SIR must follow all submission instructions found in Section L of the SIR.

The FAA will not pay any costs incurred in the preparation or submission of any response to this solicitation.

<DESC><br />***UPDATE** *January 13, 2017 - THe RFQ has been posted to GSA eBuy under the Solicitation#RFQ1163741***<br /><br />In efforts of increasing transparency and industry engagement, The United States Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Internal Revenue Services on behalf of the Treasury Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) is publishing this pre-solicitation announcement for the agency's requirement for an Enterprise wide Integrated Talent Management (ITM) solution. The IRS seeks to procure and implement a single solution enterprise-wide, cloud-based Integrated Talent Management (ITM) solution capable of addressing a full range of talent management-related activities to include, learning management, competency management, performance management, compensation management, succession planning and workforce planning / analytics software modules. Treasury plans to implement the solution across all Treasury Bureaus, encompassing roughly 100,000 employees and roughly 25,000 contract support staff. As a sanctioned government shared service provider, Treasury may seek to apply these solutions to other Cabinet Department and Agencies as well. The solution will be a part of the OCIO's Enterprise Business Solutions (EBS) shared services portfolio.
<p>Treasury is also seeking data integration, date migration, implementation support, training, help desk and recurring operations and maintenance support for the Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. Additional functionality, project support and configuration services will also be included.</p>
<p>Anticipated deliverables include software, technical documentation and technical reports. A single award Blanket Purchase Agreement is contemplated. Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and/or Labor Hour (LH) Orders may be issued under this agreement. The total ordering period for this contract will be sixty (60) months and the maximum contemplated ordering amount is anticipated to be about $18,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 511210 and the size standard for small business is $38.5M.<br /><br />The Government's intended acquisition strategy is to use an agile Two -Phased Evaluation approach commonly used in the private sector, under the federal regulations of FAR 8.405. All offeror's must have a valid General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Schedule 70; SIN 132-33, SIN 132-34; SIN&nbsp;132-51&nbsp;contract vehicle (or applicable agency/teaming arrangement) as of the date quotes are submitted to the Government and prior to award. <br /><br />1. This solicitation will have two phases in order to select the most capable Prime Contractor, based on established evaluation criteria of which will vary by phases. The purpose of the two-phase approach is to streamline the process for offerors and minimize traditional burdens placed on them associated with lengthy paper-based proposal submissions.</p>
<p>2. Offerors will have Two (2) weeks to submit their proposal for Phase One of the source selection process. All submissions will then be evaluated. The Government will initially screen each offer in accordance with the discriminating criteria in the RFQ. If an offeror is not able to meet all of the discriminating criteria, the offer will not be evaluated any further and will be eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p>3. In Phase One, the Government will then evaluate the remaining offerors 10-page concept paper submissions for technical approach, past experience, past performance and conduct a price analysis of the remaining offerors proposals. The Government will eliminate from further consideration any offerors that submitted technically unacceptable offers. The Government will then reduce the number of remaining offerors to what is considered to be an appropriate number by only inviting the most competitive offerors to Phase Two.</p>
<p>4. Offerors invited to Phase Two will be randomly assigned a date to conduct an oral presentation/demonstration in Washington, D.C. of the functional product based upon the sample scenarios. Those offerors will have about two (2) weeks to provide a functional product, testing sandbox website for product testing and a PWS. All product design concepts shall become the property of the Government.</p>
<p>5. The Technical Evaluation Panel will then evaluate the Stage Two submissions inclusive of pricing based on the established criteria and make a final award for the overall solicitation.</p>
<p>As of January 13, 2017, the entire solicitation has been issued on the GSA eBuy website <a href="https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/advantage/ebuy/start_page.do">https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/advantage/ebuy/start_page.do</a> under the Solicitation# RFQ1163741. Interested parties should visit the GSA eBuy website&nbsp;to obtain a copy of the solicitation. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />All responsible sources may submit a proposal in response to the RFQ which shall be considered. This notice is not an Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or an invitation for bid. <br /><br />Any contractual questions or questions concerning this Pre-solicitation Notice may be directed to the Contracting Officer, Justin C. DeWitt at, Justin.C.DeWitt@irs.gov.</p>

<DESC><p>1.) SYNOPSIS: This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. The proposed services, which will be obtained by negotiated Firm Fixed Price Contracts, are for a variety of Architect/Engineer services primarily for Army Reserve projects nationwide (including Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa). Projects outside the primary mission area may be added at the Government's discretion upon agreement of the A/E firm.</p>
<p>Projects will be awarded by individual task orders. The maximum cumulative contract value for the total contract is $8,000,000. This is a five year contract, with no option years. The estimated construction cost per project is between approximately $3,000,000 and $50,000,000.</p>
<p>Up to five firms will be selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second, and so on. Award of all contracts will be made within nine (9) months after award of the first contract provided there is sufficient workload. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tiebreaker between Offerors considered as technically equal. Once selected, the following factors will be used in deciding which selected Offeror will be utilized for task orders: past performance, quality of deliverables, capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, and uniquely specialized experience. Estimated start date is April 2017.</p>
<p>As a contract specifically procured by the Louisville District for the U.S. Army Reserve, the selected firms and relevant sub-consultants will be required to attend one two-day partnering workshop within 12 months of the award of the IDIQ contract. This workshop will require the attendance of representative from project management, architecture, engineering and interior design disciplines to define the Government's expectations of the Offeror, create a positive working atmosphere, encourage open communication, and to identify common goals. Cost for these sessions will be borne by the selected Offeror.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.604 and the supplements thereto, and upon final acceptance or termination, all task orders above $35,000 will receive a performance evaluation. A performance evaluation may be prepared for lesser task orders and interim performance evaluations may be prepared at any time. Performance evaluations will be maintained for use in future source selections for Architect-Engineer Services.</p>
<p>2.) PROJECT INFORMATION: The selected offeror will be solely responsible for the designs that they produce, and will become the designer of record or Design-Build RFP preparer for each individual project on their contract. Projects may consist of military projects for the U.S. Army Reserve and other military customers of USACE Louisville District. Project task orders under this indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract may include some or all of the following types of building structures: training centers (which include administration, education, assembly, storage, special training and other support spaces); vehicle maintenance shops (which include work bays, administration, special training, storage and support spaces); stand-alone buildings (which include administration facilities, unheated storage, and direct support/general support warehouses); and other structures unique to Army Reserve facilities and military installations.</p>
<p>A/E services may consist of the following activities: preparation of construction solicitations for design-bid-build (complete design) projects and design build RFP's (request for proposal); concept level designs and engineering feasibility studies; military master planning; site investigation/assessment of existing conditions; value engineering services; engineering services during construction (shop drawing review, site inspection, etc); design of demolition or deconstruction; hazardous materials survey, analysis, and abatement methodology; LEED Certification, sustainable design; construction cost estimates and schedules; technical studies/analysis in support of design for new construction and renovation; and comprehensive planning that is related to future construction requirements on military installations.</p>
<p>Additional A/E support services may include: civil site design; geotechnical studies; design for the renovation of existing facilities; interior design services; environmental compliance; National Environmental Policy Act documentation; controlled waste and flammable storage design; asbestos, lead and PCB surveys and/or abatement; and utility investigations. Other A/E services beyond traditional design may include: site selection; American Land Title Association surveys; deed and title services; DD form 1391 development; facility assessments; updating the Army Reserve Design Criteria; development of standard designs and value engineering workshops. Construction cost estimating will be accomplished for all design projects using the current generation and version of Micro-Computer Aided Cost Estimating System (MII) software (software and database is available from the Government for a nominal fee).</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, designs shall be performed using BIM technology, which utilizes computer aided design (CAD) technology with information loaded within three dimensional models. The A/E firm is responsible for the training and associated training costs for both primary and back-up BIM team members. Disciplines required for BIM are architecture, interior design, structural, mechanical, electrical, and cost estimating. BIM products will be produced in the current version of either the AECOSIM or Revit as specified in each task order.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS CHANGED AS FOLLOWS:
 This procurement is restricted to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms.    This requirement is being procured in accordance with VAAR 836.606-73 as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Although this solicitation is not limited to firms located within a 350 mile radius of the Dwight D. Eisenhower VA Medical Center, Leavenworth, Kansas, the evaluation factor for Location of Design Firm will consider the firm s location and identified subcontractors so that those firms within the radius of 350 miles will be considered more favorably.  Firms with contractor and subcontractor employees identified in the SF 330 that will come from beyond that radius will result in the lower evaluated score for that factor.  Also, in no case will travel costs for the awardee and their subcontractors be paid for any travel outside the 350-mile radius.  It is strongly recommended that a presence within the 350 mile radius be maintained as the most feasible way to efficiently accomplish the work within the time and dollars allotted.
All respondents to the solicitation are required to submit an email to the POC at arnold.payne@va.gov, acknowledging this change, accepting it, and identifying which, if any employees will be located outside that radius in order to be considered for the award.  This response is required by January 31, 2017 at 2:00 PM CST.  No additional responses to the solicitation will be accepted if not already received.

Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

Provide the team members, subcontractors, and/or vendors you plan to propose and the percentage of work each is to perform. 
Indicate whether at least 50% of the amount paid by the Government to the Prime Contractor will be paid to SDVOSBs as defined by VAAR 852.219-10 (JUL 2016) (DEVIATION).  PLEASE NOTE:  This should be considered in light of SBA guidance contained in the recently updated 13 CFR 125.6 and VAAR Clauses/Provisions 852.219-10 (JUL 2016) (Deviation) and 852.219-11 (JUL 2016) (Deviation).
