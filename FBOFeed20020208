<DESC>NA III. Time, Personnel, and Other Features of the Research. Normally, research programs can range from 1 to 3 years.  Proposals may include an option for further research that will be exercised by ARI if early results are promising. Short-term, small-scale efforts in high-risk/high-gain areas are also welcome. Fina lly, investigators are encouraged to conduct their basic research in realistic contexts, where appropriate. Both single-investigator and collaborative research efforts are acceptable, as are multidisciplinary approaches to a central problem. Collaborative efforts may involve researchers at a single institution or in cooperating institutions. Offerors with questions about the appropriateness of their planned research may send e-mail or call (less preferred method) the relevant program manager. However, use of e-mail is optional and not a secure method of communication. The government is not res ponsible for technical difficulties or disclosures resulting from e-mail communications. IV. Application Procedures. Proposals should include an abstract and be sufficiently detailed to be responsive to the criteria, described below, for evaluation. Please include an e-mail address and telephone number where technical questions can be addressed. The formal proposal must include institutional endorsement, signature of the proposed principal investigator, time frames for all phases of the project, and detailed accounts of proposed work and budget. The background and technical sections of the formal proposal must be no great er than 25 pages in length, single-spaced. Additional materials may include budget, vitae, references, and institutional information. Five copies must be submitted.  Scientific peers will review the proposals according to the following dimensions in order of importance:  (1) Importance of the research to ARI's mission and Army concerns. (2) Technical merit, appropriateness, and feasibility of the proposed approach. (3)  Scientific significance of the issue and originality. (4) The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator and key personnel, and institutional resources and facilities. Each dimensions will be given a letter grade b etween A and F.  Those proposals with very low importance to ARI and the Army will be unable to recover even with high grades on other dimensions.  Technical merit is significantly more important than dimensions 3 or 4.  Scientific significance is somewhat  more important than qualifications.  Moreover, successful proposals must have proposed costs that are both affordable and realistic for the proposed effort. The evaluation of proposed cost is subordinate to the technical evaluation.  Also, past performanc e, prior research, and research and development contracts to include timely completion and cost effectiveness will be considered. A research proposal should contain the following sections: Abstract, Background, Technical Approach, References, Resumes of proposed researchers, and Budget. Abstract. The abstract should be one page or less. It should describe the problem underlying the research, the hypothesis being tested, explain the objective of the proposal, and provide a condensed, but meaningful description of the technical approach.  I t is very important that in the abstract and in the body of the proposal, the author makes quite clear how this basic research, if successful, could lead to applied research in areas dealt with by ARI.   Background. The background should include a description of the problem, as the proposal author understands it. It is helpful if the author shows an understanding of the Army and ARI contexts that apply to the proposed research. The description of the probl em should be tied to an account of significant previous and current research that is applicable. Clearly, there will not be enough space to write a critical, annotated bibliography, but the author should demonstrate meaningful knowledge of th e background of the research that is being proposed. Technical Approach. This is a critical part of the proposal and it should be responsive to the listed criteria. It should include a description of the hypothesis upon which the research is to be based, the goal of that research, and a detailed account of h ow the research is to be done. This account should be much like the methods section of a research paper. It should include a description of the data to be collected, the methods for collecting the data, the number and source of subjects and how they will b e acquired, and the proposed research design and likely analysis methods. It is possible that an intermediate or final product of research might include training packages, simulation models, or other software-based devices. In this case, the author should show how such a product relates to the hypothesis being tested and should provide sufficient detail to permit understanding and evaluation.  The technical approach should include a statement that includes the major tasks to be performed and products to be produced.  In the case of a one-year proposal, the statement should be divided by quarters of the year.  In the case of multi-year proposals, it should be divided by year.  References. This should be a list of all the references called out in the body of the proposal. It should not include publications that are not referred to in the body. It should be in American Psychological Association format. Resumes. Resumes or vitae should be included for all proposed researchers with special emphasis on the Principal Investigator(s). It is particularly important that the resumes include those publications that bear on the research being proposed.  Budget. This should be a typical budget section as is required by other federal agencies. However, it should also include a description of total dollars required overall, per government fiscal year (the government fiscal years run from October 1 through th e following September 30), and the number of person hours/months per government fiscal year broken out by personnel type (senior scientist, graduate student, research associate, clerk, etc.). Proposers who are not in the Washington, DC area should budget at least one trip per year to ARI in Alexandria, VA to present the progress of their research.

<SUBJECT>B--BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR RESEARCH IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE,                                PART 1
<SOLNBR>DASW01-02-K
<RESPDATE>050102
<ARCHDATE>05312002
<CONTACT>Carolyn Baltimore, 703-614-6823
<DESC>NA I. The Research and Advanced Concepts Office (RACO) of the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) solicits new proposals for its fiscal year 2002 contract program of fundamental research in behavioral science. This Broad Agency Announcement is issued per FAR 35.016. The purpose of the research is to add new, fundamental knowledge to behavioral science sub-disciplines and discover generalizable principles. Novel and state-of-the-art approaches to difficult problems are especially welcome, as are integrated programmatic  efforts to develop and test theory. A portion of available funding may be made available for meritorious proposals from minority institutions and historically Black colleges and universities, and these entities are encouraged to participate. Investigations that focus on purely physiological mechanisms or psychopathology cannot be considered by this agency; however, neuroscience approaches to memory, cognition, and personality are not excluded. Similarly, no consideration can be given to purely  applied research projects (e.g., human factors studies or applied training programs).  However, support for basic science does depend on the judgment that its research findings will have the potential to stimulate new, applied behavioral technologies with  potential for improving the effectiveness of Army personnel and their units.  The decision to fund a new basic research program consists of two stages.  In the first stage, each proposal is peer reviewed for responsiveness and technical merit by at least two behavioral scientists.  Those proposals that are judge responsive and receive high technical ratings go to the second stage.  In that stage, ARI research unit chiefs are asked whether the research generated by a given proposal, if successful, would be transitioned to their applied research programs. Proposals that are highly rated and are identified as useful for one or more ARI applied research programs will be given priority for funding.  Proposals that are responsive and receive high technical rating s may also be funded but will generally be given a lower priority. II. Scientific Problems for Basic Research.  To meet the transformation objectives of the U.S. Army over the next two decades, the Army must improve its ability to:  (1) Select, train, and/or develop leaders and soldiers that are flexible and adaptable in novel missions and operational situations.  ( 2) Select, train, and/or develop leaders and soldiers to function effectively in digital, information rich, and semi-autonomous environments. (3) Select, train, and/or develop teams that can function effectively when quickly formed and/or operating in di stributed, high stress environments.  (4) Accelerate leader development of those skills that usually develop over time only through direct experience.  (5) Select, train, and/or develop leader and soldier interpersonal/intercultural skills/attributes that make leaders and soldiers effective in joint-service and multi-national operations.  These needed improvements form the broad perspective of ARIs research objectives.  In keeping with this broad perspective, the areas listed below are of special interest to ARI.  It is particularly important that proposed basic research describe clearly how it can lead to applied research that would be meaningful to the Army.  Some of the specific areas we are interested are: A.	Basic ResearchTraining and Learning. 1.	Training in Complex Situations, including factors that enhance transfer of training of the sort of complex tasks performed by Army personnel; the amount of training and feedback required to established sustainable improvements in complex task performanc e; the most effective mixes and sequences of training modes (classroom, live exercises, and simulations) in which complex tasks should be taught; reducing the effects of information overload through training; determining how individuals assign meaning and relevance to la rge amounts of ambiguous data being rapidly received, and determine how to improve this ability through training; improving adaptability through training. 2.	Interpersonal and Team Training, including the incorporation of mentoring and team learning obtained from institutional small group instruction into web-based or distance learning instruction; investigating the most effective method of developing interp ersonal skills such as communication, negotiation, mediation, emotional intelligence; determining how necessary assessment and feedback in training interpersonal skills is; best approaches to mentoring/coaching and how can one teach unit commanders such ap proaches. 3.	Training and Technology, including assessing and addressing unique training requirements in digital systems, semi-automated systems, and robotic systems; assessing the effectiveness of significant component training technologies such as virtual whiteboa rds, desktop videoconferencing, and multi-user simulation environments in distributed training; determining the best practices for utilizing the internet as (1) a channel to provide just-in-time booster training for commanders, (2) an engaging leader self- development tool, and (3) a feedback mechanism for institutions to maintain relevant leadership doctrine. B. Basic ResearchLeadership  1.	Methods for accelerating leader development to include assessment and training methods and devices. 2.	Methods for assessing and developing/training flexibility and adaptability when faced with novel situations. 3.	Self-development, including identifying the types of learning or knowledge that are best handled through self-development; the specific training needs the Army has that are best handled through self-development; the strategies or interventions can the A rmy use to support these and other individual self-development efforts; best approach (es) for self-development (e.g., reflection, web-based training, self-awareness toolkits) including the question of whether it is possible and practical for leaders to se lf-develop the interpersonal skills through distance learning; determining whether self-development has to occur in isolation or also as a social process  as part of a team. 4.	Generational Differences in Leaders. Recent research has explored generational differences along various dimensions, e.g., values, communication, self-directed activities, organizational commitment, technology, and interpersonal relations.  More specifi cally, military studies have addressed the issue of junior officer attrition and have identified and discussed the disparity between senior and junior officers in terms of generational differences. We are interested in a more valid understanding of how the se generations differ and how these specific differences impact processes and outcomes important to the Objective Force (e.g., team-building, self-development, leader teams). 5.	Leadership Selection, including determining the interpersonal skills that are essential for Objective Force leaders and how one selects for them; the limits of self-management skill and self-directed learning for Objective Force leaders, how they relate  to Objective Force skill requirements, how one differentiates them from traditional constructs and what new assessment measures can measure them; the predictors for strong self-awareness and successful self-development, how best to evaluate the impact of self-awareness and self-development efforts for Objective Force leadership. 6.	Stratified Systems Theory, including a better understanding of the relationship between the SST view of leadership (a stage theory that assumes a limited, sequential development pattern) and other assumptions about the practical limits to individual gro wth. SST is consistent with an accepted notion of adult learning. However, most research that has addressed adult learning has focused on young college students who are, at best, immature adults. Additional research is needed to expl ore the applicability of these principles to mature adults in their 30s and 40s. 7.	C. Basic Research  Human Resource Practices 1.	General Selection, including identifying the aptitude and skill requirements that are specific to the Objective Force soldier; assessing how persistence and dependability develop and contribute to effective performance and job tenure, how they relate to  job factors, and how individual differences in such processes can be measured; the extent to which practical intelligence is a function of an aptitude that cuts across domains and how to develop a method for measuring this aptitude; how to anticipate chan ge and develop performance measures for Objective Force soldiers for tasks that are not currently known.  2.	Recruitment and Attrition, including the factors that affect enlistment decision making and the factors influencing it including ethnicity; retention decision making and the factors influencing it leading to a longitudinal model of occupational choice.  This research should include the changing nature of the Army.  Motivation should be included as one of the mediators considered. D. Basic Research Social Structures The Army does not exist in a vacuum. It is a component of the overall societal system and is affected by changes in that system. We wish to support research leading to a more valid understanding of: 1.	Military Environment, including studying how major societal conditions and trends, changing Army missions, and Army culture influence recruitment, personnel retention, morale, cohesion, discipline, and military performance; how to achieve organizational  change without severe adverse personnel effects as applied to the process of the Army transformation. This research should result in models that consider the role of personal involvement by members at all organizational levels in successfully implementing change.   E. Basic Research Cognition Cognitive Functioning, including a better understanding of the growth of expertise in performance of complex tasks; the individual processes that characterize more effective team performance; Collective skill development; Barriers to team formation and fac tors that contribute to a sense of trust, explore principles of developing shared mental models including the effects of such models on understanding the commanders intent and team performance; the effects of a technologically rich, digital environment on  a leaders ability to make decisions, convey intent, adapt quickly, build teams, and resist stress.           PART 2 of the Broad Agency Announcement For Research In Behavioral Science will continue under separate FEDBIZOPS Announcement

The types of programs supported are: Counter-drug Reconnaissance and Aerial Interdiction (CD-RAID) program detachment OH-58  upgrade; AH-64 Microclimate Cooling Subsystems (MCSS); UH60 Military District of Washington (MDW) VIP Aircraft; OH-58 Common Transponder (CXP) Integration and Installation; C-12 Cockpit Modification; CH-47D Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADE C) Kits; Air Warrior Support. The primary focus of this contractual action would be performance of follow-on actions to previous engineering developmental efforts that will provide a rapid response for critical system requirements capability, principally i n support of legacy and low-density systems which have little, if any, organic or commercial support.  The place of performance would be at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.

<DESC>NA The original synopsis is amended to remove the listed items and should read as follows:  The Army Program Executive Office (PEO) for Aviation previously received an unsolicited proposal that offered to establish the capability of an Aviation Logistics Supp ort Facility (LSF). The unsolicited proposal resulted in the execution of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. This contract is a zero dollar contract with supplies and services and supplemental funding added via Task Orders. At this  time, interested sources are being sought to determine if there are contractors, other than the incumbent, who can fulfill future requirements for those that can not be fulfilled by the Aviation Public or Private Sector. The primary focus of this contract ual action would be performance of follow-on actions to previous engineering developmental efforts that will provide a rapid response for critical system requirements capability, principally in support of legacy and low-density systems which have little, i f any, organic or commercial support.  Additionally, this capability is intended to maintain the Governments ability to accomplish its mission with diminished manpower/financial without relinquishing management control of Mission Area programs, capabilit ies, competencies as well as the continuation/expansion of previously performed developmental efforts.  The requirement is for a full spectrum of Aviation Mission Area support.  At this time, it is anticipated that there will not be a solicitation issued a s a result of this inquiry.  Place of Performance would be at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Should a requirement materialize, you will be provided a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement to develop and implement an Employee Opinion Survey (EOS) to evaluate overall organizational effectiveness at its Headquarters (West Bethesda, MD) and its principal in-service engineering site (Naval Ship Engineering Station, Philadelphia, PA).   The Carderock Division is the largest and most comprehensive establishment of its kind in the free world.  For more than a century, Carderock has been at the forefront of technologies vital to the success of the Navy and is uniquely chartered By Congress to support America's maritime industry. The EOS will focus on critical organizational concerns dealing with customers and employee loyalty and satisfaction - Equitable Employment Systems, Employee Satisfaction, Employee Commitment, Superior Customer Value, Customer Satisfaction and Customer Loyalty. The co ncept of "customer" will include both external and internal customers.  Collection of comparative data in the years following the initial 2002 EOS (baseline) will provide an opportunity to measure the effectiveness of improvement initiatives undertaken in response to the 2002 survey.  This follow-on EOS effort is not currently funded. The EOS is planned in two phases.  Phase I (FY 2002) will include: (1) EOS design; (2) Survey administration/implementation; (3) Management report; (4) Communication to employees and labor unions and (5) Analysis and reporting.   Phase II (FY 2003), if implemented, will include EOS organizational socialization via Steering Groups and Focus Groups to identify opportunities for process improvement. The contractor will perform the following tasks:  Develop a web-based survey instrument that addresses the following notional EOS themes subjec t to change based upon input provided by the contractor: - Work Organization			- Pay, Benefits &                                           Recognition - Operating Efficiency			- Working Conditions -  Management				- Job Security - Supervision				- Personnel Policies                                           & Procedures - Working Relationships			- Job Satisfaction - Diversity		                - Organizational			                                - Communication				  Identification                                                                                                                 - Competitive                                           Position  - Training & Development		- Customer Focus - Performance Evaluation	        - Quality - Career Advancement			- Organizational                                                                                     Change  Develop an EOS implementation schedule and process methodology.  Conduct management, employee and labor union informational briefings to engender support and enhance the understanding of the 2002 EOS process.  Conduct a review of EOS categories (e.g., Work Organization, Working Conditions, etc.) and two open-ended questions in conjunction with a review conducted by the Carderock Division.  Review Carderock Division proposed changes, deletions, and additions to the EOS items.  Address survey design issues (e.g., the cover, introductory contents, and coding).  Design a 2002 EOS and provide survey instrument to the Carderock Division for review and approval.  Establish the data report formats.  Develop specifications and comment-grouping instructions for inclusion in survey report books and electronic copy media.  Perform survey data processing and analysis (includ es random sampling and method to ensure acceptable employee response rates).     Prepare and edit reports. Reports will include U.S. normative data comparisons relative to (a) Research & Development (R&D) national companies and  (b) Government Research & Technology (R&T) companies.  This data must include comparable R&D/R&T organizations that provide engineering and scientific knowledge and technical expertise on a reimbursable cost basis.  Provide comparative data to Carderock Division management, employees and labor unions in paper and electronic formats  Contract options, if implemented, will require the contractor to provide consultation meetings, quartile analysis, and an Interactive Survey Report (computer) Program and user's manual.  Contractor must be able to meet the following minimum requirements: (1) Have extensive EOS experience in the design and implem entation of surveys for large national and multi-national organizations that perform R&D/R&T work on a reimbursable cost basis; (2) Be able to address all stages of survey design, execution and organizational response and have extensive client support capabilities; (3) Have access to a global database of R&D/R&T best practices; and (4) Use normative data that is updated annually, is based on a broad spectrum of employee types, can link employee survey work with other corporate information needs, and provides the ability to benchmark Carderock Division results against other similar high performing R&D/R&T national and government organizations. NORMATIVE DATA: A mandatory component of the survey process is the ability of the contractor to compare NSWCCD results with those of high-performing national companies, R&D/R&T activities, and U.S. Government technical agencies.  Sur vey data will also be used to assess the effectiveness of management actions taken to improve the organization in response to employee concerns and interests identified during such Carderock Division specific interventions as the " Commanders Forum" and intra-Directorate employee surveys.  The data are an essential element in that process and will provide the basis for balanced scorecard performance measures.  The EOS process and its normative data will provide the information and insight needed to ensure that the Division invests its employee-focus improvement resources in the right places.  Data comparison will remain an important and critical feature of any follow-on surveys, if implemented.

<CONTACT>Courtney Jones, 503-808-4630
<DESC>NA The Portland District of the US Army Corps of Engineers is seeking small businesses that have the technical capabilities and interest to conduct biological and physical characterization studies at two disposal sites at the mouth of the Columbia River. BACK GROUND.  Portland District is working with the Environmental Protection Agency in their process of designating two ocean disposal sites off the mouth of the Columbia River.  Although these sites can be used for other purposes they will be used primarily by  the Corps for disposal of material dredged from the entrance channel to the Columbia River.  One of the sites, the deep water site, is new and was selected after a several year process with federal and states agencies as well as interested private groups.   The site was selected using existing information and was located in an area that the group concluded would be least impacting to the resources and fisheries in the area and have the capacity for the 50 year planning life of the disposal action.  The seco nd site is an expansion of a historic sit (Site E) at the tip of the Columbia River north jetty.  It is doubled in size to the west and is now referred to as the shallow water site.  It is a highly erosive area that is generally believed to be unproductive  except for Dungeness crabs in the summer. TYPES OF WORK REQUIRED. Studies will involve the sites from both a physical and biological standpoint. The study at the deep water site will involve physical sampling of the sediments as well as sampling benthic i nvertebrates, macro-invertebrates and demersal fish populations. The shallow water site will be limited to sampling for Dungeness crabs. The data gathered will be used to establish baseline conditions as required by the site designation process. Sampling m ethodology as well as location and distribution of stations will be the responsibility of the contractor to design and recommend in a proposal. The sampling plan should be statistically credible as well as comparable with previous studies done in the area.  Methodologies for the deep water site should also be compatible with the Revised Procedural Guide for Designation Surveys of Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Sites Tech Report D-90-8, Waterways Experiment Station, Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg, MS. The tec h report is available on line at https://www.wes.army.mil/el/dots/pdfs/trd90-8/cover.pdf.  The contractor can propose other methodologies but sufficient justification must be provided to insure comparability with historic data. Data will be analyzed using recognized statistical methodologies to adequately describe the populations in the site. REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The RFP will be a two-phase Best Value procurement issued on or about 25 February 2002.  The award is expected in the late spring to allow for s ampling to begin in June of this year.  Two seasons are anticipated, one in early summer and one in the late fall.  The data analysis and report preparation shall be completed by January 2003. Phase I of the proposal is a Qualifications Proposal that will be evaluated on the following factors: 1)Specialized Experience 2)Professional Qualifications 3)Past performance.  Two or three firms will be selected to provide Phase II of the proposal which is a technical approach based on 1)Sampling plan design (innova tive methods sought) 2)Analysis methodology 3)Phase I result. The proposed contract is 100% set-aside for small business concerns, the size standard for which is: a concern, including all affiliates, with $6 Million average annual receipts over the past th ree years.  REGISTRATION. Interested responsible firms are invited to request a copy of the subject Request for Proposal, issued in CD Rom, at no charge, by registering on our website at https://www.nwp.army.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute of health, National Cancer Institute(NCI), Dermatology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, has an urgent need to apply the nuclease P1-enhanced 32P-postlabeling chromatography assay of Dr. Kurt Randerath for the detection of I-compounds in cultured cells from patients with various neurodegenerations.  The required services can only be obtained from Covance Laboratories Inc., under the directoin of Dr. Raghu G. Nath, 9200 Leesburg Pike, Vienna, VA 22182.  This requirement is being procured under the statutory authority contained in U.S. C. 253(c)(1), and in accordnace with the FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The Dermatology Branch wishes to conduct 32P-postlabeling chromatography assays for I-compounds in DNA samples.  It is the only method known to Center for Cancer Research (DB) that can detect the I-compounds believed to cause the neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease.  These studies will lead to diagnostic test for sporadic Alzheimer disease and to antioxidants that can prevent the neurodegeneration.  The Center for Cancer Resarch (DB) wishes to establish the presence of one or more of these unrepaired lesions in these diseases.  Dr. Kurt Randerath's postlabeling assay will assist in determining whether any oxidative lesion is repaired abnormally in Alzheimer disease cells.  This is the only assay known to the Cancer Research Center that can provide the answers that DB seeks, since it detects structurally unknown oxidative lesions, any of which may be the offending damage in Alzheimer disease.  Furthermore, it can detect as few as 1-5 lesions per cell and is therefore, the most sensitive assay for lesion detection. Dr. Raghu G. Nath undertook his post-doctoral fellowship under Dr. Randerath and has published several peer-reviewed papers.  Dr. Nath heads the DNA Interactions Unit at Covance Laboratories Inc., Vienna, VA, his lab has the required equipment, chemicals and expertise to conduct these postlabeling experiments. Dr. Nath's expertise is necessary in order for DB to build upon the data already obtained, so as to avoid incorrect interpretation of the experiments being planned.  It is expected that some 120 to 180 DNA samples be assayed under these conditions.  Therefore, the Center for Cancer Research, NCI, DB believes that Covance Lab. Inc., Dr. Raghu G. Nath is the only known source that is uniquely situated and experienced to carry out the requirements.  This notice of intent is nt a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any intrested party believes it can provide the above services, including data and demonstrated expertise, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI research to determine if the party can fully meet this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT (local Washington, DC time on February 15, 2002.  If there are any questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent at (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  NAICS Code 541380. Business size standard $5M. NOTE: Due the the temporary relocation of the NCI/RCB/PSAS from 6120 Executive Blvd., Rm. 634, Rockville, MD 20892, we ask that any and all capability statements be sent to NCI/RCB/PSAS, 6116 Executive Blvd., Room 205, Rockville, MD 20892 until further notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>Submission Proposal Place:  Captain W.T.C. Wong Chung Toi, Director General, Mauritius Ports Authority, P.O. Box 379, Ports Administration Building, Mer Rouge, Port Louis, Mauritius, Phone: (230) 206-5400, Fax: (230) 240-0856.  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to undertake this Technical Assistance to develop an implementation plan for information technology (IT) modernization and integration on behalf of the Mauritius Ports Authority ( MPA).

The MPA, which is responsible for all ports in Mauritius including the primary facilities at Port Louis, has undertaken a major initiative to apply the technological opportunities resulting from the imminent completion of the South Africa Far East (SAFE) undersea fiber optic cable to improve internal and external port procedures and operations.  A recent MPA internal audit of existing IT systems indicated that organizational inefficiencies exist due to an absence of an electronic communication network.  Reports and data were being transferred between the traffic department and cargo-handling corporation in paper formats, and management did not have access to on-line information.  Additionally, MPA?s database management system has proved unstable and provides limited rollback features.  Given available technologies and systems, the MPA should be able to rely more on office automation to facilitate transactions, freeing personnel to focus more on serving customers and competitively expanding the port?s volume and business. Ideally, requirements for records storage, paper-based documentation and forms will be largely replaced by electronic messaging, digitization of records and maximum implementation of electronic data interchange and paperless transactions.

Last year, MPA contracted with a Mauritian firm to prepare a preliminary IT strategy.  Subsequently MPA requested TDA assistance with the objective of developing and implementing a plan for the modernization and integration of its IT infrastructure.    

The selected U.S. consultant would perform the following tasks relative to the IT Implementation Plan:
1.	Prepare detailed specifications;
2.	Identify and evaluate the needs for training of the MPA staff and recommend an appropriate training program;
3.	Assist the MPA with the tendering process by preparing the Request for Information (RFI) and Request for Proposal (RFP);
4.	Assist with the tender evaluation and selection of the most appropriate solution/providers for the MPA.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $220,727 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 3:00 p.m., March 29, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>Submission Proposal Place:  Mrs. Laurencia Njagi, Company Secretary, The Kenya Power and Lighting Company, Stima Plaza, Kolobot Road, Parklands, Nairobi, Kenya, Phone: (254-2) 243-366, Fax: (254-2) 337-351.  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to determine the technical, economic and financial viability for these four transmission projects:
1.	Kamburu ? Meru 132 kV Transmission Line Project
2.	Olkaria ? Lessos 220 kV Transmission Line Project
3.	Naivasha and Lanet Substation Rehabilitation
4.	Lessos ? Kisumu 132 kV Transmission Line Project

Currently, Kenya suffers from an unreliable and unstable power grid infrastructure unable to keep pace with a demand for electricity growing at 4.9% annually. Power outages and brownouts are a common occurrence. The four projects included in this feasibility study have been assigned an extremely high priority by KPLC and the Ministry of Energy. With Kenya?s gradual integration into an interconnected East Africa Power Pool, developmental priority has shifted from power generation projects to a renewed concentration on strengthening the overall stability and reliability of the country?s internal transmission system network. 

KPLC?s most recent least-cost expansion plan was developed in early 2001. This revised earlier forecasts (1999) and has placed greater emphasis on the transmission subsector, increasing voltages as well as the total distances of required transmission upgrades.

The primary tasks for the proposed feasibility study include the following:
1)	Review previous least cost expansion plans and system studies.
2)	Update load demand forecasts and substation demands.
3)	Carry out system load studies.
4)	Review transmission voltage decision.
5)	Determine possible routes and carry out soil investigatons.
6)	Optimize basic design parameters.
7)	Draft technical specifications and performance requirements.
8)	Determine budgetary cost estimates and operation and management costs.
9)	Determine optimum implementation program.
10)	Undertake project-specific environmental assessments.
11)	Assess technical risks and unknowns.
12)	Provide financial advisory services to KPLC.




13)	Prepare draft feasibility report and environmental assessments.
14)	Finalize feasibility study report and environmental assessments.
15)	Conduct Business Briefing on Procurement Opportunities at TDA?s Virginia Headquarters

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $498,804 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N.

<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>Submission Proposal Place:  Ing. Jesse Chac?n, Director General, 	CONATEL, Avenida Veracruz con Calle Cal?, Edif. CONATEL,  Las Mercedes, Caracas, Venezuela  1060, Phone: (58-212) 993-6113 / 9090318 / 9090336   Fax: (58-212) 993-0019 / 9935389.  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance package for the Venezuelan telecommunications regulatory commission (CONATEL), to assist with the development of an interconnection cost model.  

In FY 1999, TDA funded a yearlong technical advisor to work within CONATEL offices on various priority issues they had presented to TDA.  After a competitive selection process, Strategic Policy Research (SPR) (Maryland) was chosen to carry out the technical assistance assignment, which took place during 2000-2001.  At the conclusion of the yearlong assignment, final reports were produced on key topics including: corporate strategies, regulatory models, interconnection, global trends, universal service, liberalization, number portability and emergencies and disasters.  CONATEL has expressed to TDA their extreme gratitude and satisfaction with the work carried out by Strategic Policy Research.  Given their positive experience, CONATEL presented a request to TDA to fund a new technical advisor to provide them with guidance on important telecommunications policy areas that were outside the scope of the first technical advisor work plan ? primarily to develop a long-term incremental cost model in order to calculate appropriate interconnection charges.  

The scope of work for this project would include the following tasks: 

?	Construction of a bottom-up model for long-term incremental costs for the calculation of interconnection charges.
?	Modeling of the principal components for the telephone system, including actual and future demand.
?	Application of ?routing factors? to determine the usage percentages for the system.
?	Review the network architecture of each operator in the Venezuelan market.
?	Network Sizing.
?	Collection of data on prices for interconnection equipment, including operating costs and any other costs inherently related to the interconnection.
?	Determination of unit costs for each component of the system and the derivation of the interconnection cost for each type of system.
?	Development of a computerized database which would automate the interconnection process.
?	Preparation of a report that would allow the determination of the reasonable earning margin taking into account various economic factors.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $189,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).  The Grantee shall undertake its best efforts to provide reasonable support for the Contractor, such as local transportation, office space, and secretarial support.  Specifically, the Grantee will provide a telecommunications research associate/administrative assistant (full time), office space, a telephone, a desk computer (including internet and fax connections and service fees), a cellular telephone (including basic service), car with driver (Monday through Friday, standard business hours) and car without driver (Saturday and Sunday).  All of the items listed here will be provided in the city of Caracas.  

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM local Caracas time, March 13, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

This standing solicitation allows vendors to submit offers at anytime.  There shall be no closing date for receipt of offers under this solicitation.  This Solicitation is being refreshed to include new and updated clauses pertaining to the Multiple Schedule Program.  The Solicitation can be downloaded  from the Internet at http://www.eps.gov.  The new term ?Evergreen  Contracting? option periods has been added to this Solicitation.  Evergreen contracts provides new policies and procedures to expand the multiyear contracts for all Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) Federal Supply Schedules to one 5 year basic contract period and three separate 5 year option periods. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option to extend the contract for an additional three five (5) years, by providing a written notice to the contractor at least 150 days in advance prior to the expiration of the contract period.  When the Government exercises its option to extend the term of this contract, option prices must be determined fair and reasonable at the time the option is exercised.  The Contracting Officer will obtain a contractor statement that the basis of award customer/Most Favored Customer (MFC) has remained the same and that pricing information provided to negotiate the contract, as updated through any modifications, has not changed unless an adjustment is made in accordance with another contract clause (e.g., Economic Price Adjustment Clause or Price Reduction Clause).  Current contractors are not required to submit an offer under this solicitation issuance.  Contracts awarded under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award and will last for a five (5) year period, unless extended under the Evergreen option period, canceled or terminated.

All vendors and/current contractors should be aware that the Evergreen Contracting option period can not be exercised if your items offered are not on the GSA Advantage Electronic Pricelist.   This solicitation has been prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, which implement Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 (Public Law 103-355), the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106), and the final rule, published as General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) Change 76, regarding commercial item acquisitions under the Multiple Award Schedule Program.  The contract format and data requirements in this solicitation differ from previous solicitations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to carefully review the entire solicitation package before submission to ensure compliance with commercial item provisions. Contractors are now required to accept the Government purchase card for payments equal to or less than the micro-purchase threshold for oral and written delivery orders.  Contractors are encouraged to accept the Government purchase card for payment for orders above the micro-purchase threshold.  See GSAR Clause 552.232.77, entitled ?Purchase by Credit Card?. This solicitation contains the new clause ?Contractor?s Report of Sales? (552.238-74), which requires the submission of sales on electronic GSA Form 72A via the Internet and ?Industrial Funding Fee? (IFF) (552.238-76) which requires a 1% payment due on a calendar quarter schedule.  Offerors must include the IFF in their prices.  The fee is included in the award price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities.  GSA has established a contract sales criterion for all Multiple Award Schedules.  Clause I-FSS-639, entitled ?Contract Sales Criteria?, states that a contract will not be awarded if the anticipated sales are not expected to exceed $25,000.  Contracts will also be canceled unless reported sales for each 12-month period from date of award are $25,000 or above.  This Federal Supply Schedule will no longer have a prescribed beginning and ending date.  The schedule period will be continuous, and will contain contracts with contract periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusion of any options) from the DOA.  Unless otherwise noted in the solicitation, new offers may be forwarded at any time.  All requests for a diskette or hard copy of the solicitation should be faxed to (703) 305-5537, attention: Linda N. Poole.

These isotopes will be used for production in support of medical and scientific research.  The Department's objective of this effort is to poll the research community in order to generate a list of research isotopes that DOE will consider for production for FY 2003 and beyond.  A peer-review process that examines the merits of the isotope-based research as described in the Expressions of Interest in response to this Notice of Program Interest (NOPI) will be used to help determine which isotopes will be placed on the Nuclear Energy Protocol for Research Isotopes (NEPRI) list and therefore be eligble for production. Dates:  Opening date: February 18, 2002, and Closing date:  March 29, 2002. Addresses:  Complete details, instructions on how to apply, and opening and closing dates will be provided via a formal solicitation document which will be disseminated electronically as solicitation number DE-RI01-02NE00000 through the Department's Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) home page located at https://doe-iips.pr.doe.gov.

The contract type will be an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), with delivery orders awarded for each site.  The quantity of blocks and site-specific configurations for the blocks will be cited on the individual delivery orders for MMBs at each site.  The MMB delivery schedule requires delivery of all blocks (estimated 1,500) to the six (6) CONUS locations by May 2002.  The contractor must have the capability to produce and deliver this volume of blocks (FOB Destination).  The solicitation will be made available, on or about February 25, 2002 on the Hanscom Electronic Request For Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB) website listed below.

<DESC>NA The Army Program Executive Office (PEO) for Aviation previously received an unsolicited proposal that offered to establish the capability of an Aviation Logistics Support Facility (LSF). The unsolicited proposal resulted in the execution of an Indefinite D elivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. This contract is a zero dollar contract with supplies and services and supplemental funding added via Task Orders. At this time, interested sources are being sought to determine if there are contractors, other t han the incumbent, who can fulfill future requirements for those that can not be fulfilled by the Aviation Public or Private Sector. The primary focus of this contractual action would be performance of follow-on actions to previous engineering developmenta l efforts that will provide a rapid response for critical system requirements capability, principally in support of legacy and low-density systems which have little, if any, organic or commercial support.  Additionally, this capability is intended to maint ain the Governments ability to accomplish its mission with diminished manpower/financial without relinquishing management control of Mission Area programs, capabilities, competencies as well as the continuation/expansion of previously performed developme ntal efforts.  The requirement is for a full spectrum of Aviation Mission Area support.  At this time, it is anticipated that there will not be a solicitation issued as a result of this inquiry.  Place of Performance would be at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Should a requirement materialize, you will be provided a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>s needs, an evaluation process may not be implemented.  If the review process clearly identifies one assessment as superior to meet DoDEA's needs, an evaluation process may be conducted using the selected assessment to identify areas where written or training guidance are needed.  If 2-3 assessments are identified as potentially acceptible to meet the needs of the Agency, each of those assessments may be evaluated to gauge student and educator satisfaction with the instruments.  The evaluation process is anticipated to begin in spring 2002 and includes approximately 90 students.  Following the evaluation process, a determination will be made as to which instrument, if any, meets the needs of DoDEA.  At the conclusion of the evaluation process, an awardee(s) may be granted to fully implement the assessments for all students (approximately 7,000) taking the US History course. Implementation may begin in school year 2002-2003.  A contract may be awarded to include a base year and three options.  The assessment measures what students know and are able to do based on the performance standards. The rating of the proposals in the technical evaluation will be the most important factor in the evaluation.  The Government intends to award a contract, based on the awardee(s) of the evaluation process and reserves the right to award multiple awards based on the evaluation process.  This procurement will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 12, Subpart 12.6, using simplified acquisition procedures and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27.  DoDEA is a federal government agency, tax exempt, an education activity and qualifies for academic/educational pricing.  Federal Supply Code (FSC) is B542, Educational Studies & Analysis.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511130, Book Publishers, with a Size Standard of 500 employees. Note that this notice is for market research purposes only, however, the information gathered from this notice will be used to determine which preference program will be used to process the acquisition (e.g., 8(a) set-aside under the Small Business Administration's program, total small business set-aside, full and open competition).  DoDEA anticipates issuance and release of a solicitation on or about January 7, 2002, which will be available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is mandatory (www.ccr2000.com).

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development/Regional Center for Southern Africa (RCSA) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Transtel Corporation, Forum 3, Braampark, 33 Hoofd Street, Braamfontein 2001, South Africa to complete the remaining installation of the communications and computer equipment and integration of the system software to USAID?s RSIS Project in Southern Africa. Transtel is the only known firm with the unique capability to complete the RSIS project, due to their extensive experience with the project and their unique knowledge of the telecommunication network,  software and Southern Africa Railways system.

The RSIS activity involves the design, development and installation of a real-time, inter-linked and integrated information system on transportation operations and financial transactions. It has been under implementation since March 1998.  Most of the equipment is delivered, installed and commissioned.  Transtel is currently providing the maintenance service for installed equipment.  Transtel has also delivered most of the training of the railways personnel.

The RSIS project was implemented originally with Transtel as the key subcontractor because of its previous work with the existing domestic railway tracking systems.   Since March 1999, Transtel has supplied, installed and commissioned satellite telecommunication equipment, radio equipment, power generators and training railway personnel in the operation and maintenance of the relevant equipment.  The RSIS installation requires the use of VSATs and microwave radio technology as the basis for the communications infrastructure to support RSIS.  This effort, which has already substantially been completed by Transtel, forms the backbone of the RSIS project.
  
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) railways have agreed to have Transtel, under separate SADC contracts, manage the RSIS WAN (Wide Area Network) from its Johannesburg hub facility, monitoring the system operation and providing maintenance services as a long-term sustainability solution.  Transtel has leased capacity on the PanAmSat satellite that covers 90 percent of Africa and the whole of southern Africa and is the current leading supplier and the provider of satellite communication and equipment maintenance service to the SADC railways.  The utilization of Transtel as a prime contractor will thus enhance the common desire among the railways for a unique and credible working relationship with Transtel that will support the sustainability of the RSIS as a regional tracking system.

Transtel was instrumental in coordinating equipment and software system interface with the railways and the subcontractors.  Transtel is organizationally linked to Spoornet, the developer and provider of a significant portion of the RSIS software.  This places them in a unique position to complete the software integration throughout the entire RSIS, enhancing efficiency and reducing project risks. 

The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the system integration that will satisfy the agency requirements and therefore intends to  solicit and negotiate a sole source contract with Transtel under the Authority of FAR 6.302-1.
 
Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact. All responses to this notice will be considered in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(d)(2).  Any possible determination by the Government to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  Information must be submitted no later than 16:00 Botswana time on February 21, 2002.  NAICS:  488210 - Support Activities for Rail Transportation.  Competition Level:  Other Than Full and Open

<SUBJECT>D -- NOTICE OF INTENT - SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT - SERVICE IN THE AREA OF EDIT METHODOLOGY AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS THAT INTERFACE WITH COMPLEX EDITS
<DESC>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302, the U.S. Census Bureau intends to contract on a sole source basis for services to provide expert advice and assistance in the area of edit methodology and processing systems that interface with the complex edits.  The highly specialized nature of this work requires exceptional expertise in the design and testing of edits particular to the specific requirements of the Census Bureau. In order to complete this project in the timeframe required, the contractor will need to have a thorough understanding of each of the major components and subsystems that interface with the edit. The edit is parameter driven and interfaces directly with another database that contains each of the edit factors for all countries and harmonized codes. A complete understanding of the relationship between the edit and the parameter files is essential to the success of the conversion. Additionally, explicit knowledge of the structure and programming logic used to develop the parameters database will be necessary to properly integrate an edit written in a different computer language. Extensive experience writing customized software to edit and analyze import and export transaction level data using both Cobol and SAS will be necessary to ensure that a learning curve of the subject matter doesn't impede or impair our ability to meet the tight schedule reflected in the contract.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Census Bureau's needs.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the U.S. Census Bureau, Acquisition Division, 4700 Silver Hill Road, Room #1557 (Mail Stop 1700), ATTN:  William Russell, Suitland, Maryland 20746.  This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government.  If no affirmative written response is received within 10 days from the publication of this synopsis, a contract may be issued to the proposed contractor without further notice.
