<DESC>Y--Request for Proposals 101814R004 Bolca Chica Lowlands Restoration Project - Pre-Solicitation Meeting being held on Thursday, FEB 5, 2004 11:00 to 12:00 at the Huntington Beach CIty Council Chambers in Huntington Beach, CA.   This  construction project is estimated over $50 million dollars.  Full Bid/Performance/Payment Bonds are required.  This is a best value procurement, evaluation criteria will at a minimum consist of experience and past performance, price will be a secondary consideration.   The solicitation, plans, and specifications, will only be available electronically at www.nbc.gov web site.    Please review the 65% plans and specifications prior to the Feb 5th meeting so we can have a valuable discussion period.   This is a Federal Project and Davis Bacon Wage Rates will apply. Project Description: The Bolsa Chica Lowlands Restoration Project is located in Orange County, California adjacent to the City of Huntington Beach. The purpose of the project is to restore portions of the wetland ecosystem of the Bolsa Chica lowlands. The project area covers about 1,247 acres and will restore tidal influence from the Pacific Ocean to about half of this area to reinvigorate the wetland ecosystem. To achieve the biological benefits of tidal restoration, a direct connection to the Pacific Ocean must be reestablished through the creation of a new tidal inlet that will cut through Bolsa Chica State Park and cross the Pacific Coast Highway. Construction is anticipated to start in October, 2004 and to occur in four primary phases over three years in order to avoid or minimize impacts to fish and wildlife resources, coastal traffic, and beach recreation. The Pacific Coast Highway and adjacent Oil field facilities will remain in operation during the entire construction period.  Project Features: Full Tidal Basin: A 366 acre tidal basin will be constructed that will receive full tidal action from the new ocean inlet. Approximately 2,700,000 cy of material will be removed from 175 acres within the basin to support depths varying between 6.0-6.8 feet below mean sea level (MSL). Excavated material will be dredged and dry excavated for project construction features. Material will be used to pre-fill an ebb bar (1,300,000 cy of  > 80% sand), build levees for the full tidal basin (456,000 cy), three nesting areas (366,000 cy), beach nourishment fills (190,000 cy), an inter-tidal shelf for cordgrass (98,300 cy) and as much as 253,000 cy of material may be hauled off site. Muted Tidal Basin: A 200 acre muted tidal basin will be created through  three box culvert and weir connections between the full tidal basin and the proposed muted tidal basin. The boxed culverts will include water control structures to regulate the tidal influence.  Additional site modifications include site improvements for tidal channels and overflow structures. Pocket Muted Tidal Basin: The pocket muted tidal basin is an isolated pocket of land on the north side of the East Garden Grove Wintersburg Flood Control Channel that forms the northern boundary of the project. In order to gain access to a suitable tidal water source, hydraulic connections must be made to the Outer Bolsa Bay adjacent to the tide gates of the adjacent flood control channel. Nesting Habitat Islands: Three nesting areas will be created on twenty acres within the site for federally-listed endangered species. Nesting areas will be constructed using 366,000 cy of material excavated from the full tidal basin at elevations from existing ground to 4-10 feet.  Ocean Inlet: An ocean inlet will be constructed to the full tidal basin that will be 360 feet in width between the levy crests and encompass an area of approximately 3.7 acres when completed. As the inlet is excavated, approximately 190,000 cy of sand will be placed for on the adjacent state beach for beach nourishment purposes.  Entrance Jetty: To stabilize the inlet, two jetties will be constructed to prevent the entrance channel from closing. Each jetty will be approximately 450 feet in length from Pacific Coast Highway to the jetty tips. Each jetty will be about 100 feet at their base. The area of beach that will be excavated to construct the jetties and the inlet totals is about five acres. The amount of rock in the inlet jetty and under the bridge is about 72,000 tons.  Shoreline and Bridge Revetments: Approximately 750 feet of shoreline revetment will be constructed on each side of the jetties on the west side of the PCH bridge. Following construction, they will be buried under beach sand. The total amount of rock in these is 31,000 tons. In addition, a revetment would be placed east of the bridge for erosion protection in the flood shoal management area of the full tidal basin. The total amount of rock in these is about 138,000 tons. Ebb Shoal: To stabilize the down-coast region near Huntington Cliffs from the loss of the existing beach, assure sand movement along the beach and maintain beach stability, an ebb shoal will be constructed just outside the inlet mouth. The equilibrium volume of the ebb shoal will be approximately 620,000 cy of sandy material. To provide additional safety, it is proposed to place as much as 1,300,000 cy of sandy material (> 80% sand) in the proposed ebb shoal location over approximately 45 acres of soft bottom substrate. Pacific Coast Highway Bridge and Retaining Walls: A bridge will be placed along the existing alignment with Bosla Chica State Beach immediately to the west of the road right-of-way and Bolsa Chica Wetlands immediately to the east. The bridge will accommodate four traffic lanes and a separate safety vehicle/bike path for the local beach traffic along Bolsa Chica State Beach. Roadway drainage improvements will be constructed in the inlet/PCH bridge vicinity. Retaining walls are utilized to minimize land requirements along the west side of the bridge. The recommended bridge structure is a ten span cast-in-place deck slab structure 420 feet long supported on driven pre-stressed concrete piles, about 18-24 inch in diameter, with a desired capacity of 70 tons each. Stage construction will include maintaining four lanes of traffic during construction. Oil Service Bridge: In order to maintain existing oil field operations on a parcel isolated by the new ocean inlet, a two lane oil service bridge will be constructed parallel to the PCH bridge. The bridge structure will include a ten span cast in place deck slab structure 420 feet long supported on driven concrete piles with the same standards as the PCH bridge. The two lane structure will also include a three meter wide utility platform that will accommodate production lines for oil field operations including oil, gas and water lines in casings. Groundwater Barrier Approximately 10,000 feet of groundwater barrier will be constructed to prevent groundwater and salinity intrusion under the adjacent neighborhoods. The salinity intrusion barrier will be up to 30 feet deep.  A French Drain to control shallow groundwater levels will be up to 10 feet deep and will include several pump stations that will discharge into the muted tidal basin. Issues that will affect work schedule: 1.  Notice to proceed will be issued to the awarded contractor on or before September 1, 2004. 2.  No clearing or grading work can begin in the Full or Muted Tidal Basins until after October 1, 2004. 3.  The PCH Bridge should start at the beginning of the project and be completed as soon as practical. 4.  The Oil Service Bridge construction should not be started until the PCH detour has been removed from the Whipstock area. 5.  Excavation of the Full Tidal Basin (FTB) can be undertaken in the dry using conventional dewatering methods. 6.  Excluded and contaminated materials will be completely excavated from the FTB prior to the start of the remainder of the excavation. 7.  Sand will be pumped offshore from a stationary dredge located near the oil service bridge. 8.  All pumping of sand to the offshore ebb bar will take place between October 1 and March 1. 9.  The Nesting Sites and South Levee must be completed prior to March 1, 2005. 10. Jetty and revetment stone will be brought to the site by truck. 11. The east parking lot at the State Beach will be closed during the construction of the PCH Bridge and stockpiling of rock for the jetties and shore revetments. 12. The expansion of the RV parking area at the State Beach will not be part of this contract.  13.  Modifications of the EGGW Channel or levees, other than minor strengthening in the area of the FTB will not be part of this contract. 14. The gas line will be abandoned prior to October 1, 2004. 15. Oil facilities in the FTB and those in conflict with the levee alignment will be removed prior to October 1, 2004.  Key Early Schedule Dates: 1.  September 1, 2004	Notice to Proceed 2.  October 1, 2004	Earliest start of construction operations in the FTB 3.  August 15, 2004	Early opening of PCH 4.  June 5, 2006		Inlet sand plug removal

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reports that there were approximately 6 million children under the age of 18 living with at least one parent who was dependent on alcohol or drugs in 2001. In addition, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism estimates that one in four children live in families with  with alcohol abuse. Children in these families often live in environments that are stressful, high risk, chaotic, and frightening.  Frequently, they are neglected or abused and face economic hardship and social isolation as well.  They often have difficulty mastering social and emotional tasks needed for healthy development and are more vulnerable to costly mental health and medical problems.  
With the assistance of the nation’s leading experts in program development, assessment, and strategies for helping this population, the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACoA) developed the Children’s Program Kit for SAMHSA in two phases under purchase orders 99M00472001D and 01M00885901D.  NACoA is the only national organization that knows the material that needs to be covered, understands how to implement the program, and has the ability to provide the expert training for the Children’s Program Kit.  NACoA’s trainers have years of teaching treatment centers and others to:

o	Understand the enormous negative impact that alcoholism and drug addiction have on the family, especially the children;
o	Teach the children to draw on their own inner resiliency to not only survive, but also to thrive;
o	Teach the children to understand alcohol and drug addiction, how it impacts them, and how they can find help for themselves;

<SUBJECT>S -- Utility Privatization of Electric, Natural Gas, Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Systems at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma
<SOLNBR>SP0600-03-R-0130
<RESPDATE>080803
<CONTACT>Robert Jones, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-767-9407, Fax 703-767-8757, Email rejones@desc.dla.mil - Richard  Mann, Contracting Officer, Phone 703 767-9403, Fax 703 767-2382, Email Richard.Mann@dla.mil
<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the electrical, natural gas, water and wastewater infrastructure systems at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s). The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP. The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: Installation: Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. System Descriptions: Electric, Natural Gas, Water and Wastewater. The electrical distribution system at Vance AFB is through a single 69-kilovolt kV transmission line into a substation located on the north end of the installation, west of Hairston Gate.  The 69 kV transmission line feeds a 69/12.47kV, 7500 KVA transformer.  The 12.47 kV distribution level voltage is fed underground to an electrical switching station, which is adjacent to the OG&E substation but is owned by the Air Force.  The electrical distribution system consists of five 12470/7200 volt three-phase feeders.  The distribution system consists of approximately 78,000 linear feet of underground service and an estimated 25,500 linear feet of overhead service. Vance Air Force Base currently receives a hydropower allocation from the Southwest Power Administration (SWPA). The estimated savings benefit for Vance is approximately $350,000 per year in electric commodity cost. A successful privatization effort would force SWPA to revoke the allocation and distribute it elsewhere. Revocation of the allocation and the resulting economic effect will be included in the government’s privatization calculations. The RFP will convey this information. The natural gas distribution system  is supplied to the base by Oklahoma Natural Gas Company via a single four-inch 200 psi supply line which is master-metered at the base perimeter. The distribution system consists of approximately 13 miles of underground main which is normally maintained at 16 psi; the main lines are all wrapped and coated steel pipe with cathodic protection. The water distribution system utilizes water supplied by the City of Enid via a single 10-inch main at approximately 60 psi. The base supply main carries water to a 300,000 gallon ground storage tank; water is pumped from there into a 500,000 gallon, 110 foot elevated storage tank. Water is distributed from that point through approximately 20 miles of mains, 90% of which are constructed of steel. The wastewater system consists of approximately 13.5 miles of sewer mains and one primary lift station and force main; five small lift stations and force mains are used to connect individual facilities into the main system. Wastewater is discharged into the City of Enid’s sanitary sewer system for treatment. See Note 26. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. Interested sources shall contact Bobby Jones at 703-767-2397 to be added to our bidder mailing list. A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL. The solicitation will be available sometime after August 8, 2003 LINKURL: http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/DCMPage.asp?pageid=246 LINKDESC: http://www.desc.dla.mil EMAILADD: Robert.E.Jones@dla.mil

<SUBJECT>R -- Treasury 4th Annual Texas Vendor Outreach Session
<DESC>Attention Texas and surrounding state small business concerns:  The U.S. Department of the Treasury, in partnership with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the Internal Revenue Service, is pleased to offer again its acclaimed Vendor Outreach Session program to small business vendors of all types interested in doing business with Treasury's local offices in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area.  Due to the resounding success of previous events and based on participant feedback, we have made plans for another session.  The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is again serving as the lead Treasury bureau for this effort.  The Vendor Outreach Session will be held on Thursday, January 29, 2004 at the Renaissance North Dallas Hotel, 4099 Valley View Lane, LBJ Freeway at Midway Road, Dallas, TX, and will feature a pre-arranged 15 minute appointment format with Treasury procurement and program staff.  Agenda includes: 7:30 - 8:00 a.m. - Registration and Continental Breakfast, 8:00 - 8:15 a.m. - Welcoming Remarks, 8:15 - 9:00 a.m. - Introduction to Doing Business with Treasury, 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 noon - One-on-One Counseling Appointments.  There is no cost to attend; however, vendors must pre-register for appointments.  For additional information and to send an e:mail registration to pre-register, go to the Treasury website at http://www.treas.gov/sba/texasvos.html. The website includes the agenda, a list of products and services that our Treasury counselors are seeking, tips to make attendance a success, and automated appointment scheduling procedures.  Again, although there is no cost to attend, appointments must be made in advance in order to participate.  There will be no walk-in appointments available.  Requests for appointments will be accepted until close of business, Friday, January 23, 2004 or until the counseling sessions are totally booked.
