<DESC>***THIS NOTICE IS BEING POSTED AS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION 5.203(2)***

The General Services Administration (GSA) has a requirement for a full range of multi-channel contact center services.  This requirement represents a re-solicitation of the multi-channel contact center services originally solicited under GSA Request for Proposal GSV07PD0003.

Request for Proposal GSV07PD0003 has been cancelled.  The reason that solicitation was cancelled is because the Government has determined that the minimum experience requirements, cited in Section L.7.2.1.3.1, are overly restrictive.  Cancellation of the original solicitation and re-issuance of the new solicitation is taken to comply with the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.206(e).

Although this is a re-issuance of a previous requirement, all potential offerors, including offerors who submitted a proposal under the original solicitation, are expected to carefully review the complete set of General Instructions for Preparation of a Proposal, Section L.7 of the revised solicitation, because changes, other than changes to the minimum experience requirements, have been made.

Offerors, who provided a timely and otherwise responsive offer to the original solicitation, and chose not to make any changes to their proposal in response to the revised solicitation, are not required to submit a new proposal.  They do, however, need to submit a letter on company letterhead, signed by an individual who was authorized to submit the proposal in response to the original solicitation, stipulating that the entire proposal submitted in response to the original solicitation, represents their entire proposal in response to the revised solicitation, and the this proposal remains in full force and effect.

All offerors who submitted a proposal in response to the original solicitation, who?s proposal is not in accordance with General Instructions for Preparation of Proposal of the revised solicitation, or offerors that chose to made changes to their proposal submitted in response to the original solicitation must, as must all new offerors, submit a proposal in full accordance with instructions in remainder of Section L.7 of the revised solicitation.  

Offerors who provided a proposal under the original solicitation and who are providing a new proposal under the revised solicitation are requested to identify all changes with a vertical line in the right hand margin of the page.

Offerors, who provided a timely and otherwise responsive offer to the original solicitation, and chose not to make any changes to their proposal in response to solicitation GSV07PD0007, are not required to submit a new proposal.  They do, however, need to submit a letter on company letterhead, signed by an individual who was authorized to submit the proposal in response to the original solicitation, stipulating that the entire proposal submitted in response to solicitation GSV07PD0003 represents their entire proposal in response to solicitation GSV07PD0007 and that the proposal remains in full force and effect.

All offerors who submitted a proposal in response to solicitation GSV07PD0003, whose proposal is not in accordance with General Instructions for Preparation of Proposal of that solicitation, or offerors that chose to made changes to their proposal submitted in response to solicitation GSV07PD0003 must, as must all new offerors, submit a proposal in full accordance with instructions in remainder of Section L.7 of solicitation GSV07PD0007.

Offerors who provided a proposal under the original solicitation and who are providing a new proposal under the revised solicitation are requested to identify all changes with a vertical line in the right hand margin of the page.

<SOLNBR>LA-UR-07-6181
<RESPDATE>100107
<ARCHDATE>10022007
<CONTACT>Michael Erickson, Licensing Executive, Phone 505-667-8087, Fax 505-665-6127, Email michaele@lanl.gov - Michael Erickson, Licensing Executive, Phone 505-667-8087, Fax 505-665-6127, Email michaele@lanl.gov
<DESC>Intermediate Band Solar Cell Technology
Call for Commercialization Plans


Los Alamos National Laboratory Technology:

Solar cell efficiency limitations for commercially available silicon solar cells remain at approximately 14-16%. Unfortunately, the highest efficiency cells aren?t always the most economical and thus have not yet realized significant market penetration. A variety of methods have been developed in an effort to improve technological efficiency in the solar cell industry, but certain physical, chemical, and economic constraints prevent successful commercialization.  

Recent research at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) introduced a method of potentially increasing solar cell efficiency using Intermediate Band Solar Technology.  This method uses interface mixing procedures and nano-sized optoelectric structures believed to increase solar cell efficiency much further above and beyond current capabilities.  

The Problem:  Optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, radiation detectors, and light emitting diodes generally depend on bulk effects of semiconducting materials, in which only a single band-gap is accessible under these conditions, which constrains the upper limit of efficiency to less than 41%. In the present state of the art, photons with energy below the band-gap are not absorbed in a material. Conversely, photons above the band-gap are absorbed, but the excess energy of the photon above the band-gap is lost to heat.  This leads to sub-optimal single band-gap efficiency.

A Possible Solution:  Proprietary interface mixing procedures developed at LANL introduce a second band inside the band-gap described above. Photons with energy below the band-gap, which would normally not be absorbed, will then excite electrons from the valence band into the intermediate band or from the intermediate band into the conduction band, thus producing electricity from sub-band-gap radiation. This may lead to much greater energy production than what is currently possible.

LANL researchers believe that further development of these basic techniques will generate new technologies that will greatly improve band-gap efficiencies to perhaps beyond 60%. Consequently, overall solar cell efficiency is expected to increase as a result of these advancements.

Development Stage:  

Resources are required to perform proof-of-concept work.

Applications:
?	Photovoltaic cells
?	Radiation detectors
?	Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)

Benefits:
?	Increased energy output per solar cell (improved efficiency)
?	Potential decrease in solar cell footprint per given quantity of light
?	Reduced unit cost

Call for Commercialization Plans:

LANL is requesting Letters of Interest from parties who would like to receive additional information regarding this commercialization opportunity. Letters of Interest must be received at LANL by COB October 1, 2007.  This is not a call for proposals and no funding is available from Los Alamos National Laboratory related to this notice.

Once the NDA has been executed, LANL will send a Commercialization Plan template to each qualified respondent that previously submitted a Letter of Interest. The package will include details regarding the following time line: 1) submission date for Commercialization Plans; 2) target date for selection of the most qualified licensee(s); and 3) the negotiation and license execution process. Commercialization plans will be held as company proprietary information and no information from one applicant will be shared with any other.

Commercialization Process:

?	Submit Letter of Interest by October 1, 2007 to the contact listed above.

?	LANL will send a bilateral Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Please sign and return to LANL by COB October 8, 2007.

?	Submit commercialization plan to LANL by COB November 2, 2007.

?	Commercialization plans will be reviewed by the LANL selection committee.

?	Selected licensee(s) will be notified by November 14, 2007 and provided with a license term sheet to initiate negotiations.  

?	It is anticipated that any ensuing license agreement(s) will be executed with the selected respondent(s) on or before January 31, 2008.






Please note the following information in evaluating this commercialization opportunity:

There is a possibility that the inventing scientist at LANL may elect to form a start-up company and compete for a license to this technology. To avoid any possible conflict of interest in the event that this situation materializes, the Laboratory will not share any information from any applicant with the LANL scientist, nor will they be involved in the selection of the final licensee(s).

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NOI7155 issued as a Notice of Intent.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-17.     This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business concern.     The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561990, which has a size standard of 6.5.     The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to award sole source procurement to Department of Microbiology and Instituto de Ciencias Neurologicas, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima Peru.     This protocol is designed to research the effects of possible treatment of neurocysticercosis.     The objective is to determine if an enhanced treatment regimen of corticosteroids is more effective in controlling seizures in patients with intraparenchymal cysticercosis who receive antiparasitic treatment.     The goal of this is to 1) compare the cumulative frequency of seizures (partial and generalized) on study days 90 and 360 in patients treated with these regimens, 2) compare the proportion of patients free of viable cysts on study day 180 and 360 in patients treated with these regimens, 3) compare the proportion of persistent viable cysts on study day 180 and 360 in patients treated with these regimens, and 4) compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.     The work is to be performed in Peru to understand the pathophysiology of disease in neurocysticercosis.     This is work for a clinical trial study that is an open-label randomized study designed to compare the effectiveness of a short compared to a longer course of corticosteroids employed to suppress antihelminthic treatment induced seizures in neurocysticercosis. Eligible adults with one or more viable intraparenchymal cysts and a history of seizures within the past 6 months are randomized to one of two groups. The first group (Arm 1) is randomized to receive a 14-day course of albendazole and 6 mg dexamethasone for ten days, the same regimen of corticosteroids employed in the above mentioned published trial. The second group (Arm 2) is randomized to receive the same course of albendazole (15 mg/kg albendazole in two divided doses, max 1200 mg day) but enhanced dexamethasone dosing consisting of 4 weeks of 8 mg/day dexamethasone followed by a two week taper. At study day 42, 3 months and 1 year the number of generalized and partial seizures, the proportion of patients with seizures and side effects will be compared between the two arms.     The period of performance will be from the date of award to July 27, 2008.     The proposed contract is for services and related supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and procure with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.

CLDP is supporting the U.S. Government?s Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) by providing technical assistance to a group of countries in the Middle East to improve their legislative and regulatory frameworks, and ultimately, to facilitate the region?s preparedness for the Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA).  As trade and commerce increases in the Middle East and the countries in this region expand their presence in the global market, it is important that their business and legal professionals have knowledge and understanding of complex commercial law.

The present Scope of Work describes the work to be performed by a Contractor in support of CLDP?s activities under the program.

2.3	Coordinate in the US and abroad with CLDP legal staff and legal advisors regarding the implementation of judicial and commercial law programs, including assisting in the implementation of CLDP programs for judges, lawyers, law professors, and other jurists.
2.4	Draft progress reports and provide updates/information per CLDP/Washington office requests.
2.5 The Contractor must be willing travel to any of, but not limited to, the following countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.  Dates for such travel will be jointly agreed upon by CLDP and the Contractor.

In case of events beyond the control of the parties, CLDP and the Contractor will agree upon a new schedule and period of performance.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

____________________________________________________________

The Federal Acquisition Service of the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement a Local Services Acquisition (LSA) for Telecommunications Services.  The Government will award a series of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with a base period of three years and four (4) twelve month option periods.  Firm Fixed Price task orders will be issued under the resultant IDIQ contract.  The Government plans to award multiple LSA contracts in the states of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware.  These contracts will be for the use of all Federal agencies, authorized Federal contractors, agency-sponsored universities and laboratories and, as authorized by law or regulation, state, local, and tribal Governments, and other organizations.  The Government has defined three service groups: Voice Services (VS), Data Transmission Services (DTS) and Internet Access Services (IAS), along with the labor and material necessary to connect these services to customer premises equipment (CPE).  Offerors must propose mandatory voice services to be eligible for an award.

The Government desires to make multiple awards for LSA services but reserves the right to limit the number of awards.  Contracts will be awarded to Offerors whose proposals are most advantageous to the Government.  The actual number of contracts awarded will be determined by the Government and based on technical acceptability and price evaluation of mandatory LSA services.  The following Technical factors will be considered: Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Management Approach.  The Technical Factors of Technical Approach and Past Performance will be approximately equal in weight and each will be greater in weight than the Management Approach factor.  The combined weight of all technical evaluation factors will be approximately equal to the Price Factor of Total Evaluated Discounted Cost.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used as set forth in FAR Part 15.  Offerors are advised that an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; and to award contracts to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total evaluated discounted cost.  Therefore, proposals should be initially submitted on the most favorable terms.

The Request for Proposal (RFP), consisting of the solicitation and all attachments will be issued and posted electronically on the www.fedbizoppps.gov website.  Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Kristin L. Markiewicz, GSA Contract Specialist, at Kristin.Markiewicz@gsa.gov.  This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAICS Code 517110.  The solicitation should be available on or about 07/23/2007.  Potential offerors should be advised that the date of a pre-proposal conference will be announced at the same time as the issuance of the RFP and is estimated to be conducted approximately two weeks after the official RFP is posted.

Agency ? NAVAIRSYSCOM, CODE 2.5.1.3.3.3, BLDG 441, 21983 Bundy Road, Unit 7, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127

POC:	Angela Munro, Contract Specialist, e-mail: angela.munro@navy.mil 
	
This notice constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) as contemplated by FAR 10.002(b)(2)(iii).  
  

AIRCRAFT SURVIVABILITY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT,     
TEST & EVALUATION (RDT&E) PROJECTS

I.  	INTRODUCTION:

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program Office (JASPO) is seeking to learn about industry?s Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) ideas for aircraft survivability. It is hoped some of these ideas may be of interest to the JASP community and result in future JASP project proposals.  This RFI is being issued now to allow time to learn about and discuss your ideas and locate potential contracting avenues prior to our deadline for FY09 project proposals in December 2007. 

II.	BACKGROUND:

Originally chartered as the Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Aircraft Survivability (JTCG/AS), the JASP has been actively pursuing technologies to support aircraft survivability and coordinate aircraft related survivability issues between the Services for over 30 years. The JASP is a government funded program reporting to the Office of Secretary of Defense/Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (OSD/DOT&E) and chartered by the Services aviation systems commands.  The day-to-day operation of the JASP is under the direction of the Joint Aircraft Survivability Program Office (JASPO).  JASP is a tri-Service program whose mission is to achieve increased affordability, readiness, and effectiveness of aircraft through the joint coordination and development of survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability reduction) technologies and assessment methodologies. 

Annually, JASP issues a call for project ideas (proposals) and funds approximately $3M in new start projects and $6M in continuing projects.  JASP projects typically last 1-3 years and receive between $100-200K per year with a potential maximum funding level of $500K per year.  A key tenant of the JASP program is the leveraging of JASP funding with funding from other organizations. 
 
JASP issues its call for project proposals via e-mail to DoD agencies.   JASP does not directly fund contractor efforts but provides funding to DoD agencies for project management and contracting, thus the requirement for DoD sponsorship.  Contractors may elect to and are encouraged to directly contact appropriate DoD agencies for sponsorship at any time, in addition to any consideration due to this announcement.


III. 	SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST:

The JASP RDT&E effort is organized into three subgroups: Susceptibility Reduction, Vulnerability Reduction and Survivability Assessment (Modeling & Simulation). The JASP is interested in RDT&E initiatives that will enhance the combat survivability of both manned and unmanned aircraft.  Its principal focus is Science and Technology (S&T) for advanced technology/component development and demonstration RDT&E (6.3) as well as improving the JASP?s modeling and simulation tool set.  Areas of particular interest are listed below by subgroup category:
Susceptibility Reduction

Advanced development proof-of-design concepts are sought that will offer clear, quantifiable benefits in reducing the probability of military aircraft being hit by enemy fire.  Such concepts should lead to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5 or 6 and may range from ideas for improving operational suitability of existing susceptibility reduction systems (cost and weight reduction, increased reliability) to ideas for entirely new capabilities.  Proposals from across the spectrum of susceptibility reduction technologies are invited (e.g., IR, visual, acoustic signature reduction) but the JASP has particular interest in the following:

?	Technologies or concepts that, if developed successfully, would significantly benefit operational units in the near-term by solving an existing problem (e. g., IR decoy flares that reduce an aircraft?s visual signature without impairing countermeasures effectiveness).
?	Technologies or concepts that will defeat current and future generation IR threats such as MANPADs, imaging IR seekers, and infrared search and track systems.  Such technologies or concepts include low cost approaches to IR missile countermeasures and warning or entirely new concepts.
?	Technologies or concepts that will counter advanced coherent, parameter-agile radar threats employed against both manned and unmanned military aircraft.  Threats could include advanced radars and passive radars.  Technologies could include electronic attack and electronic protection techniques.
?	Technologies that improve blue force survivability through increased Situational Awareness (SA).  Although the benefits of enhanced SA are difficult to quantify, technologies that improve SA have the potential to increase the effectiveness of existing Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), as well as improve or modify Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) (e.g., Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) for gunfire).

Vulnerability Reduction

Emphasis should be on technologies/techniques that increase an aircraft?s capability to withstand the man-made hostile environment (holistic approach to threat tolerance or aircraft hardening).  A balance between technologies/techniques that are breakthrough in nature (with potentially high risk, high payoff gains) and technologies/techniques that are mature enough to transition into near-term, fieldable systems is desired.  Areas include, but are not limited to: 

?	Opaque and transparent ballistic protection systems
?	Crew and passenger protection (non-armor)
?	Fuel containment protection for tanks and lines
?	Fire suppression/extinguishing systems (passive and active)
?	Damage tolerant & repairable subsystems
?	Advanced materials development
Survivability Assessment

Improve the capability and credibility of government-owned survivability Models and Simulations (M&S), focusing on M&S residing in the Survivability/Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC).  Other M&S providing capabilities beyond those of the SURVIAC are also of interest, and will be considered on a case by case basis.

?	CAPABILITY:
o	Robust signature, countermeasure and environment modeling
o	Vulnerability phenomena of conventional, unconventional and asymmetric threats
o	Authoritative blue system performance data (including vulnerability)
o	Integration of authenticated threat models from the Intelligence Centers
o	Transition legacy M&S to Threat Modeling and Analysis Program (TMAP) M&S

?	CREDIBILITY:
o	Compare SURVIAC models results against open-air range data, or other authoritative data to confirm/increase credibility
o	Sensitivity studies to better understand assumptions and limitations of survivability models, and provide input to investment strategies

IV.   	SUBMISSION OF PROJECT IDEAS:
This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) but rather a Request for Information (RFI) on your current survivability RDT&E and other ideas that may be of interest to the JASP.  This will be the only JASP request for survivability RDT&E ideas prior to the project proposals call to DoD agencies in September 2007. 
NAVAIRSYSCOM will acknowledge receipt of your response and forward to the appropriate JASPO subgroup Technical Point of Contact (TPOC).  The JASPO will review submitted responses for compatibility with the JASP mission and at their discretion, contact the submitter for further information.  When an idea is deemed of sufficient interest to the Government, the submitter (or their selected representatives) may be invited to submit a FY09 project proposal for possible JASP funding.  

You are required to follow the instructions provided in this notice for the submittal.  Packages will be forwarded by the Contracts Office to the appropriate POCs for Susceptibility Reduction, Vulerability Reduction and Survivability Assessments. 

SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS:

All proprietary portions of the project idea package shall be clearly identified and will be treated in the strictest confidence. Submissions are limited to US participation and must be unclassified.  

Submissions are not to exceed twelve (12) pages using a contractor selected format and must clearly state the subgroup intended (as identified above) so it may be forwarded to the appropriate TPOC.  Submissions shall be sent electronically (MS Word, PDF or MS PowerPoint format) to angela.munro@navy.mil .  Confirmation of receipt is recommended for electronic submission.    If the Government intends to pursue a specific submission, the vendor will be notified in writing of this intent.  IF THE PACKAGE IS GREATER THAN 15MB, A ZIP FORMAT IS REQUIRED.  

The Government is not liable for any costs associated with submissions or any subsequent requests for project proposals or briefings.

<SUBJECT>59 -- SCBA O2 Fire Training Video
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-464-07MR-1149
<RESPDATE>080207
<CONTACT>ALEISHA  MOORE, PURCHASING AGENT, Phone 304-256-3215, Fax 304-256-3350, Email MOORE.ALEISHA@DOL.GOV
<DESC>MSHA IS SEEKING SOURCES FOR THE FOLLOWING:
Background:

While filling an SCBA oxygen tank for mine rescue training, a large, extremely hot fire erupted at an oxygen pump severely burning the Benchman.  The root cause of the fire was inadequate training of mine personnel in the setup, maintenance, and operation of the SCBA filling system.  Provisions of the new Miner Act that require more mine rescue teams and additional mine rescue training will increase the use of SCBA?s and the likelihood of another oxygen fire and injury.  To stay ahead of this risk, a training video will be developed to cover oxygen fire hazards and the precautions needed to help ensure the safe refilling of SCBA?s using oxygen booster pumps.


Final Product:

A training video, in DVD format, shall be prepared.  The video shall deal with the fire hazards of filling SCBA?s using an oxygen booster pump.  The video shall cover the entire SCBA filling process, including but not limited to, installation/construction of the refilling facility, receipt of oxygen supply bottles, maintenance of equipment, and training of personnel.  The video will be prepared for an audience of mining personnel that have received some prior training in the filling of SCBA?s. 

Deliverables:

The contractor will prepare a draft script and suggest various video footage/graphics required.  The contractor will coordinate with MSHA in determining the overall presentation concepts.  The contractor should rely on MSHA for administrative functions in order to control contract costs.  

MSHA will coordinate input and review of the script by MSHA and industry personnel (mine operators, mine rescue team benchmen, booster pump manufacturers, O2 suppliers, and others as necessary).   

Upon approval of the script by MSHA the contractor will assist MSHA in defining the video storyboard.  The contractor will help define the shots required and shoot and edit the video as required.  The contractor will also provide video graphics as necessary.  Filming of the process and especially actual oxygen fires at the contractor?s test facility will be conducted as necessary.  The contractor will provide necessary test facility personnel. 

The contractor will coordinate with MSHA and oxygen booster pump manufacturers (Haskel, Drager, Masterline, etc.) to include in the video as many different pumps and their manufacturer?s recommended safety procedures as practicable.  The contractor will also coordinate with MSHA and oxygen suppliers to include their safety recommendations.   

As necessary, copy-right permission for the video must be granted to MSHA at no additional charge.

Video production and distribution will be MSHA?s responsibility.

The contractor will assist MSHA in preparation of a hard copy format of the training.  This document will include the final script, revised as necessary for hard copy presentation, and additional information not included in the video.  This additional information may include full copies of oxygen booster pump manufacturer?s safety literature, oxygen supplier recommended safety practices, industry best practices, applicable industry safety standards, more detailed safety information, and, as necessary, documentation of references for statements in the video. 


Travel:

No travel expenses by vendor personnel are included in this purchase order.  MSHA or industry personnel may arrange mutually agreeable visits to the vendor?s facilities as necessary.


Service Rates:

The vendor will bill MSHA on an actual cost basis but shall not exceed the maximum amount specified in the purchase order.  The vendor should exercise prudent judgment in the choice of personnel working on the project.  Lower service rates should be charged where practicable to still achieve a quality product.


Safety and Health:

MSHA is dedicated to safety and health.  

It is of utmost importance that the training video depict safety and health procedures based on sound engineering, best industry practices, and OSHA and MSHA regulations and recommendations.  Where appropriate, concepts from ANSI Z10, Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems, should be incorporated into the training.  

The contractor is encouraged to suggest new or innovative safety and health concepts.  These must be clearly identified as such and accepted by MSHA prior to inclusion into the script.

All filming, especially of any staged fires, conducted at the contractor?s facility must be thoroughly planned.  The contractor must perform a risk assessment to identify hazards and necessary precautions.  All work must meet OSHA regulations.  Additional precautions may be necessary.

POC IS ALEISHA MOORE AT MOORE.ALEISHA@DOL.GOV OR FAX TO 304-256-3350. NO PHONE CALLS ACCEPTED. QUESTIONS ARE DUE BY 7/27/2007.

The following questions were posted:

What is your time frame in regard to both the awarding of bid and for the production itself?
The time frame for the awarding of the bid will depend on how many quotes are received and the evaluation process. This may take at least a week. We anticipate the production will take about 8 weeks

Can you please tell me if you are looking for a contractor who will do all the things needed for completing a video, including the actual video taping and editing, music, etc. or just a contractor who will help produce it without supplying production services? MSHA is seeking a vendor with expertise in oxygen safety to assist in producing the script.  MSHA personnel will perform most of the video production.
 
What do you mean when you indicate that travel is not included?  Does this mean that only local vendors may bid?  To reduce costs, MSHA does not anticipate any travel by the vendor.  MSHA will coordinate with the vendor the shooting of scenes away from the vendor?s facilities.  MSHA and other parties may arrange mutually agreeable visits to the vendor?s facilities. 

Where do we need to be registered in order to bid on this project? You do not have to be registered in order to provide a quote. In order for MSHA to process a purchase order you would have to be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.
 
 What is the process for bidding? To bid, please submit a quote via e-mail or fax to the fax number provided and after the closing date, the quotes will be evaluated.
 
1. What is the estimated running time (in minutes) of the proposed training video? 2. Will Government-provided subject matter expert(s) (SME[s]) oversee the writing of the video script and be present during the video production? 3. Will the Government provide non-speaking on-camera personnel (i.e. a Benchman, miners, et cetera) to appear in the video? 4. Will the Government supply the Contractor with specialized "props" to be used during the production (i.e. SCBAs, oxygen booster pumps, personal safety equipment, uniforms, et cetera)? If the Government indeed intends to supply these props, will the Contractor be permitted to use them during an actual oxygen fire?  
5. Will the Government require the Contractor to conduct on-camera interviews for the video? If so, how many interviews / statements will be required, who will appear in these interviews, and where and when will these interviews /statements occur? 6. Will the Government require the Contractor to record video in places where Benchmen, miners, and other people as required can be found working? If the Contractor is required to shoot in these places, will suitable electrical power (Alternating Current [AC]) be available for video lights and other equipment? The length of the video will be established based on the final script.  We do not anticipate the video will exceed 45 minutes.

MSHA personnel will oversee the writing of the script and be present during production.

MSHA will have personnel available to appear in the video but will also require vendor trained facility personnel to perform demonstrations as necessary.

MSHA has an oxygen pump and facilities at the National Mine Academy in Beaver, WV that can be used in the video.  However, the vendor is to supply all items for personnel.

Any interviews and the location of the interviews will be determined during preparation of the script.  No information on interviews is known at this time.

MSHA anticipates that most of the video production will be performed by MSHA personnel.  The locations will be determined during development of the script.

Length of video?

What administrative functions will MSHA provide?

How many different pumps and their manufacturer's recommended safety procedures will be shot?

Has the government requested a similar type of video?
 
Is the government?s decision on the contractor only based on cost?
 
How many days of shooting does the government anticipate for this job?
 
Will all the shooting be in 1 location?
 
If not please state where the locations are?
 
In the services sought it says the contractor will provide necessary test facility personnel. Please clarify.

The length of the video will be established based on the final script.  We do not anticipate the video will exceed 45 minutes.
 
MSHA will provide administrative functions such as typing, proof reading, printing, setting up meetings, and collecting and distributing documents.  MSHA also anticipates that MSHA personnel will shoot most of the video.
 
The number of different pump manufacturer?s pumps that will be included will be determined in the final script.  We anticipate three will be included.
 
We are aware of a similar video on oxygen regulator fires by the FDA.  See:   http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ocer/dcm/html/gallery.html 
 
The choice of vendor will primarily be based on the vendor?s knowledge of oxygen safety.
 
The number of days of shooting will be determined during development of the script and during actual production.  No estimate is available.  MSHA anticipates that MSHA personnel will shoot most of the video.
 
The shooting will likely take place at the vendor?s facility, MSHA?s National Mine Academy in Beaver, WV, and at a mine site to be determined.  Additional locations may be added.
 
MSHA anticipates that the successful vendor will be able to provide a facility and trained personnel to demonstrate best safety practices when using oxygen and stage fires, as necessary.
 
Does the MINE SAFETY & HEALTH ADMINISTRATION NATIONAL MINE SAFETY & HEALTH ACADEMY have a preferred vendor who has or has access to a ?test facility? where ?actual oxygen fires? could be conducted as necessary?? MSHA's intention is that prospective vendors have specialized knowledge of oxygen safety.  The vendor must be able to provide a facility with trained personnel for best practice demonstrations and the staging of fires, as necessary

Does this have to be shot at a specific location?
Do you have locations lined up (mines or manufactures) to shoot at?
I noticed that there is no money for travel costs.  Is this correct?
If there is no money for travel costs does it make sense for a company in California to bid on this project?
Do you have a budget range for the final product?  This is very helpful as it gives a sense of what you are looking for in terms of creative and quality.  This is something other government clients have done in the past.
How long to you think the final product will be?
Also ? do you have a treatment or detailed synopsis of the final product?  It is very difficult to create a budget without this as the creative drives the costs.  Is it a 5 day shoots or a 10 day shoots ? are there 10 extras or 50 extras, etc.
Do you want us to send in DVD samples of work
 Specific shooting locations will be determined during preparation of the script.  However, MSHA anticipates that a significant portion of the shooting will take place at MSHA?s National Mine Academy in Beaver, WV with additional shots at the vendor?s facility and at mining operations.
 
Several pump manufacturers have been contacted and they have expressed an interest in supplying pumps for shooting but MSHA has not discussed any shooting at their locations.  One mine in Alabama may participate.
 
To control costs, MSHA does not anticipate any travel by the vendor.  MSHA, and others as agreed to, will travel to the vendor?s facilities.  MSHA anticipates that MSHA personnel will coordinate shooting at other locations with the vendor.
 
MSHA is primarily seeking vendors with expertise in oxygen safety.  MSHA personnel will perform most of the video production work and associated travel.  Location of the vendor?s facilities should not negatively impact the contract.
 
We can not provide vendors with the budgetrange
 
The length of the video will be determined during preparation of the script.  MSHA anticipates the video will not exceed 45 minutes.
 
No detailed description of the video has been prepared.  A general outline follows.  The final product will be determined during preparation of the script.  
 
?                    The O2 booster pumps are very common.  This video may have a wide audience.
?                    People are not aware of the intensity and violence of an O2 fire.  Footage of an O2 fire video may be a good opening scene.
?                    The video should cover step-by-step instructions for the SCBA bottle refilling process.  Receipt of the O2 supply cylinder, cracking the valves, inspection of the system, connections, filters, and other system components should be covered.  
?                    The FDA has a oxygen regulator fire video available that may give us some ideas.   http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ocer/dcm/html/gallery.html# 
?                    Three ignitions mechanisms should be covered- particle impact, adiabatic compression, and contamination.
?                    There are lots of good practices that can be presented.
?                    We can use a format where a narrator or trainer is discussing the hazards with mine personnel.
?                    We?ll need shots of all of the components.
?                    We?ll need fire and aftermath footage.
?                    We should reference CGA, NFPA, OSHA, and MSHA (hazard communication) regs.
?                    Footage of a recreation a fire would help show the nature of the fire.
?                    MSHA mine rescue personnel will be asked to provide input for the video.
?                    The need to maintain O2 pumps per their operator?s manuals over the life of the equipment needs to emphasized. 
?                    The O2 pump involved in the fire was in use for a long time without incident and O2 fires have a very low probability.  We don?t want the video to exaggerate the hazard or scare people who need to work with oxygen.  We want mine personnel to know the hazards but also understand that the hazards can be managed.
 
Sample work is not required for consideration but will be accepted. 

The place of performance is in Triadelphia, WV not Beaver, WV

Response date has been extended to August 9, 2007. Please forward all questions by August 6, 2007.

Solicitation is set aside for small business only.

(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

The operating system will be located at the West Roxbury and Jamaica Plain, MA facilities.  *3.  Description of the supplies or services required to meet the  	agency's needs (including the estimated value). 	ABACUS Priority ONE System.  Complete Inventory Management  	System for Supply, Processing and Distribution to track all  	Instrumentation.  This system 	will identify every piece of  	Instrumentation by stock number and cross reference stock  	Number with other vendors, identify the nomenclature between  	The Operating Room and Supply 	Processing and Distribution, track and monitor the flow of instrumentation between Supplies, Processing and Distribution and the Operating Room. 	Vendor will provide a complete inventory of all instrumentation held in Supply Processing and 	Distribution, photos of each instrument, Interface with the Operating Room scheduling package to ensure that schedule changes within the Operating Room are sent to Supply 	Processing and  	Distribution and priorities identified. The Estimated value is $335,000. The following items are included in the system: ABACUS PriorityONET  (Includes Hardware, Support and Software License for the following locations) Decontam Station  Prep & Pack Station Sterilizer Station  Case Cart Station  ABACUS O.R. Scheduling InterfaceT  Server  O.R. ReportingT Station  Includes Hardware and Software License Annual maintenance fees will apply in year two Inventory AuditT Includes Hardware and Software License Annual maintenance fees will apply in year two Inventory Labeling ABACUS PriorityONET Annual Workstation Maintenance Fee, Year 2 and ongoing (Annual Maintenance fees are included in the Software License for the first year.) 4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other     than full and open competition. 	FAR 6.302-1 (C) Application for Brand Name Descriptions. USC 	 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source, *5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications  	or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the  	Authority cited.  Unique aspects of the Abacus System are a total in-house inventory management system that provides a total turnkey operation for the Operating Room and Supply, Processing & Distribution areas from implementation of the goods, inventorying of all instrumentation, providing count sheets, pick lists, and the complete uploading of all information and will maintain database for the Boston Healthcare System.  One of the crucial needs of the government was to be able to buy this piece of equipment, in which the other vendors weren't able to offer that. The other companies offered to lease the equipment to the government without the option to buy. Proposed vendor will provide a complete list of the instrumentation inventory, were the other vendors did not provide this.  The other vendors offered manual input of the inventory and the updating of the system to be performed by the VA, whereas, the proposed vendor would be performing that service.   A critical component to the system regarding the interface with the Operating Room package providing a re-prioritization of scheduled cases for the Supply, Processing & Distribution Staff allows increased flow and optimization of cases through the Operating Room and Supply, Processing & Distribution.  Automated System enhances communication between departments, increasing utilization of required instrumentation and improving productivity and turn around time for the sterilization of instrumentation.  This critical component allows staff at a minutes notice to identify any changes to ensure that the appropriate cases are ready and any emergent or additional cases are factored into the schedule and therefore revises the priorities of Supply, Processing & Distribution.  Vendor is also providing a total inventory count of all instrumentation and labeling to be completed by the vendor.  Vendor will provide 7 days per week 24 hours per day 365 days a year total client and IT support. At no time are any of the processes, instrumentation, kits, staff, or decontamination and sterilization processes outsourced with this system.  Based on the information in this section, Applied Logic, Inc., is the only source that can meet the Government's needs for this functionality. *6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are  	Solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Federal Business Opportunity notice was or will be published. The following announcement was posted to the Federal Business Opportunities system on 7/29/07: The VA Boston Healthcare System intends to negotiate and procure on a sole source basis an ABACUS Priority One System from Applied Logic Inc. located in ST. Louis, MO.  This procurement of the equipment includes decontamination station, prep and pack station, sterilizer station, case cart station, abacus Operating Room scheduling interface and server.  This procurement is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other vendor or product will satisfy agency requirements.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted.  However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within seven (7) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  This information can be faxed to Carol AhNee at 857-364-6521.  Responses will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   	The following vendors were contacted, however were unable to provide these services. 	1.  Rosebud Solutions, LLC           350 S. Main Street Suite 220           Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104 	2.

An announcement was placed in the FedBizOpps on 7/29/07 and there hasn't been any firms that have responded to the Advertisement as of 8/7/07. Operating Room/Supply, Processing and Distribution/Infection Control have met with two other vendors to discuss and review their inventory systems and the impact on SPD staff.  Rosebud Solutions requires much more manual input from SPD to include a complete physical inventory of all instrumentation and are responsible for updating system.  Cardinal requires the system to be leased with a contract to buy all instrumentation from V. Mueller and identifies a specific purchase threshold we must meet on a yearly basis.  BHS would not be able to purchase all instrumentation from this company due to the specialties and instrumentation currently in kits.   *9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and Open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions,  statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition has not been developed or are not available.

<DESC>AMENDED SYNOPSIS Runway w/Shelters, Transient AC Apron and Medium AC Apron, Al Asad DESCRIPTION:  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineer (COE) Transatlantic Programs Center intends to solicit names of construction firms or joint ventures experienced in working in the Middle East region who are interested in submitting a firm-fixed price offer fo r this project.  To be considered a construction firm, the firm must perform construction as a significant portion of its business.  The estimated cost of construction is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. PROJECT SCOPE:  The work will consist of design and construction of a new,  a) Runway w/ Shelters, b) Transient Aircraft Apron,  and c) Medium Aircraft Apron at Al Asad, Iraq.  The project is located on Al Asad Airfield in the Central Region of Iraq. CONTRACT PROCEDURES:  Both a price and a technical proposal will be required.  The evaluation criteria will consist of pricing and non-pricing (technical) consideration.  Pricing and technical considerations will have approximate equal weight with one anot her in the evaluation and selection processes. Price will be evaluated on the basis of the completeness, reasonableness and cost risks of the prices proposed.  Completeness of proposed prices will be evaluated by the Government based upon a comparison of the process proposed as compared against the req uirements of the solicitation, scope of work and those costs included in the Independent Government Estimate (IGE).  The reasonableness of prices proposed will be evaluated on the basis of comparison of those prices with the prices proposed by the offerors  and as contained within the IGE.  Conclusions concerning likely future cost risk will be based upon the results of the Governments review and analysis of all aspects of the price proposals. Non pricing factors include offerors past performance, experience, and management and technical capabilities.  Management and Technical capabilities will consist of at least four sub factors:  Management and Staff Organization, Subcontracting, Security Co nsiderations, and Execution Plan. Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to prime contractors responding to this notice.  Tentative date of issuance of RFP is 20 September 2007.  Tentative date for receipt of proposals is 19 October 2007.  Tentative contract award date is 15 November 20 07.  Contract award will be made on a firm-fixed price basis.  The anticipated contract duration period is 480 days. POINT OF CONTACT:  Tariq J. Choudry, 540-665-4988, Tariq.j.choudry@tac01.usace.army.mil.

<ARCHDATE>09162008
<CONTACT>Joe Pratt Contract Specialist 2083785139     jpratt@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>A) The Pacific Northwest Regional Office of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation intends to award one or more general purpose indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for engineering and other professional services in the states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington in support of the PN Region's programs. These contract(s) will require civil, electrical, hydraulic, and mechanical engineering expertise plus expertise in architecture, the environmental, natural, physical and social sciences, planning, economics, and cost estimating.  B) We also intend to award one or more ID/IQ contracts specifically for anadromous fish habitat improvement projects in the States of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.  The anadromous fish habitat improvement contract(s) will require expertise in hydraulic engineering and modeling, process geomorphology, stream restoration, sediment transport analysis, and project planning permitting. The principal NAISC code for all of these requirements is 541330.  The purpose of the general purpose contract(s) will be to provide assistance on PN Region projects, which will require multi- disciplinary activities involving a variety of professional specialists in engineering and planning as well as support functions in areas such as economics, environmental, natural, physical, and social sciences.  The projects for which these services are required will primarily be located within Reclamation's Pacific Northwest Region; however, they could also include Reclamation's other Regional Offices and Denver Offices, as well as programs for which Reclamation is performing technical support services, e.g. Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS), Bonneville Power Administration (BPA),  and other Dept. of Interior Agencies. Instances of work outside the PN Region will be rare and the primary geographic area for these services is anticipated to be the states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.  The purpose of the anadromous fish habitat improvement contract(s) will be to support the PN Region of Reclamation's efforts in improving fish habitat in the Interior Columbia River basins. All proposed IDIQ contract(s) will be for a period of one year from the date of contract award with four 1-year option periods. Only firms with Registered Professional Engineers licensed in the states of interest where work will be conducted will be considered.  The cumulative amount of all Task Orders placed against the general purpose contract(s) is not expected to exceed $5 million and the cumulative amount for Task Orders under the anadromous fish habitat contract(s) is not expected to exceed $2 million. We currently have two ID/IQ contracts in place that cover all of our current programs (including anadromous fish habitat improvement) and the total dollar value of the Task Orders awarded under those contracts is less than $5 million. Under those contracts approximately 30% of the Task Orders were related to Reclamation's efforts for the Federal Columbia River Power System Salmon Recovery programs (anadromous fish habitat improvement) and the remaining 70% were Task Orders for activities supporting Reclamation's Operation and Maintenance of our dams and power plant facilities or for environmental services (Environmental Assessments, Biological Assessments, Environmental Impact Statements) or for special planning or engineering studies.  It is Reclamation=s intent to award multiple ID/IQ contracts but we reserve the right to award a single general purpose and/or a single anadromous fish habitat improvement contract if it's determined to be in the Government's best interest to do so.  The estimated date of award is February 2008. The A&E selection criteria are listed below. [Note: A) for the purposes of awarding the general purpose contract(s) Criterion 1 through 4 will be evaluated in the following specific fields: architecture and civil, hydraulic, structural, electrical, mechanical, geo-technical, geomorphologic, and environmental engineering and related services such as environmental, natural, and physical sciences and; B) for the purpose of awarding the anadromous fish habitat improvement contract(s) Criterion 1 through 4 will be evaluated in the following specific fields: hydraulic engineering and modeling, process geomorphology, stream restoration design, sediment transport analysis, and fish habitat improvement project planning/permitting] (1) Professional staff qualifications including education, work experience, and registration status of personnel and an adequate number of professional staff in the specific fields as stated above; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the planning and design of projects related to the specific fields of engineering and of similar magnitude and nature as required under this acquisition, [with preference given for an emphasis in water resources development projects and construction and maintenance of water resource and electric power production infrastructure for the general purpose contract(s) and with preference given to those with specific experience related to improving fish passage as well as stream and habitat restoration for the award of the anadromous fish habitat contract(s)]; (3) Demonstrated corporate capability which reflects the capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, including adequate physical and technical resources considering numerous task orders may be executed simultaneously throughout any of the states in the Pacific Northwest; (4) Evidence of project management philosophy and operating procedures which resulted in an efficient, and appropriate technical approach to tasks to be performed, with regard to project team structuring, subcontractor usage, etc.; also indicate how you plan to provide services in a cost-effective manner (5) Demonstrated contract management capability which reflects good past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; and (6) Firms located in the general geographical area of Reclamation's Pacific Northwest Region (with preference given to firms having an office within the local commuting area of Boise, Idaho for the general purpose contract(s)).  Firms qualified and interested in providing professional services of the types listed above are hereby invited to submit: Standard Form 330 (SF 330), "Architect-Engineer Qualifications," Part I and SF 330 Part II. An Adobe Acrobat version of the SF 330 form is available at www.gsa.gov.  Firms may propose for one or both types of contract(s): general purpose A&E or anadromous fish habitat improvement A&E but the firm (or team) must be able to cover all areas of the PN Region for the type of work they are interested in performing (general purpose A&E or fish habitat A&E). When preparing your submission, BE SURE TO CONSIDER ALL EVALUATION CRITERIA. Additional sheets may be used to address all evaluation criteria relative to the required services.  Following the initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, discussions will occur with firms considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the services for each of the three states.  Negotiations will occur beginning with the most preferred firm(s) in the final selection.  If a mutually agreeable contract can be reached, then award will be made.  If not, then negotiations with that firm will be terminated and the next most preferred firm would be contacted for negotiation.  Please submit SIX copies of the above information to: U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, 1150 N. Curtis Road, Boise ID 83706-1234, ATTN: PN-3715, Contracting Officer; include Solicitation No. 08SP101677 on the outside of the package.  Please do not submit any work samples at this time.  Reclamation reserves the right to request work samples during the evaluation process. To be considered, all material must be received by 4 PM local time in Boise ID on November 14, 2007.  Reclamation plans on hosting a pre-proposal conference the week of October 1, 2007, at the PN Regional Office.  Specifics about the date, time, and locations for the pre-proposal conference will be made available after September 24 on our website at http://www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts/index.html. Potential offerors are encouraged to register at that website to be included on the official bidders list.  When registering for the bidders list offerors may specify whether they are a prime contractor or are interested in potential subcontracting or teaming arrangements.  The small business size standard for this acquisition is $4.5 million in gross annual receipts averaged over the previous three 1-year accounting periods.  This requirement is NOT a set-aside. See Numbered Note 24.

The contractor shall provide personnel, supervision and services necessary to maintain Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) F-15SG and United States Air Force (USAF) F-15C/D and F-15E aircraft based with the 366th Maintenance Group (366 MXG), located at Mountain Home AFB (MHAFB) except  for those government furnished property and services.  The contractor shall provide coordination, maintenance, servicing, ground handling, inspection, and repair of all assigned MHAFB aircraft, aircraft components, engines and associated mission support equipment.  Additionally, the contractor shall provide flying and maintenance scheduling, database management and analysis, centralized control (a maintenance operations center), maintenance training functions and specialized support functions in accordance with the PWS.  The 366th Maintenance Group is responsible for maintenance of all 70+ assigned F-15C/D, F-15E and two trainer aircraft, associated aircraft systems, support equipment and munitions.  The RSAF build-up will add an additional 10 F-15SG aircraft with a possible surge to 20 aircraft for short periods of time to the MXG total.  The F-15SG is a similar version to the USAF F-15Es; two major differences include a different avionics package and GE 110-129C Engines.

<SUBJECT>59 -- SCBA O2 Fire Training Video
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-464-07MR-1149
<RESPDATE>080207
<CONTACT>ALEISHA  MOORE, PURCHASING AGENT, Phone 304-256-3215, Fax 304-256-3350, Email MOORE.ALEISHA@DOL.GOV
<DESC>MSHA IS SEEKING SOURCES FOR THE FOLLOWING:
Background:

While filling an SCBA oxygen tank for mine rescue training, a large, extremely hot fire erupted at an oxygen pump severely burning the Benchman.  The root cause of the fire was inadequate training of mine personnel in the setup, maintenance, and operation of the SCBA filling system.  Provisions of the new Miner Act that require more mine rescue teams and additional mine rescue training will increase the use of SCBA?s and the likelihood of another oxygen fire and injury.  To stay ahead of this risk, a training video will be developed to cover oxygen fire hazards and the precautions needed to help ensure the safe refilling of SCBA?s using oxygen booster pumps.


Final Product:

A training video, in DVD format, shall be prepared.  The video shall deal with the fire hazards of filling SCBA?s using an oxygen booster pump.  The video shall cover the entire SCBA filling process, including but not limited to, installation/construction of the refilling facility, receipt of oxygen supply bottles, maintenance of equipment, and training of personnel.  The video will be prepared for an audience of mining personnel that have received some prior training in the filling of SCBA?s. 

Deliverables:

The contractor will prepare a draft script and suggest various video footage/graphics required.  The contractor will coordinate with MSHA in determining the overall presentation concepts.  The contractor should rely on MSHA for administrative functions in order to control contract costs.  

MSHA will coordinate input and review of the script by MSHA and industry personnel (mine operators, mine rescue team benchmen, booster pump manufacturers, O2 suppliers, and others as necessary).   

Upon approval of the script by MSHA the contractor will assist MSHA in defining the video storyboard.  The contractor will help define the shots required and shoot and edit the video as required.  The contractor will also provide video graphics as necessary.  Filming of the process and especially actual oxygen fires at the contractor?s test facility will be conducted as necessary.  The contractor will provide necessary test facility personnel. 

The contractor will coordinate with MSHA and oxygen booster pump manufacturers (Haskel, Drager, Masterline, etc.) to include in the video as many different pumps and their manufacturer?s recommended safety procedures as practicable.  The contractor will also coordinate with MSHA and oxygen suppliers to include their safety recommendations.   

As necessary, copy-right permission for the video must be granted to MSHA at no additional charge.

Video production and distribution will be MSHA?s responsibility.

The contractor will assist MSHA in preparation of a hard copy format of the training.  This document will include the final script, revised as necessary for hard copy presentation, and additional information not included in the video.  This additional information may include full copies of oxygen booster pump manufacturer?s safety literature, oxygen supplier recommended safety practices, industry best practices, applicable industry safety standards, more detailed safety information, and, as necessary, documentation of references for statements in the video. 


Travel:

No travel expenses by vendor personnel are included in this purchase order.  MSHA or industry personnel may arrange mutually agreeable visits to the vendor?s facilities as necessary.


Service Rates:

The vendor will bill MSHA on an actual cost basis but shall not exceed the maximum amount specified in the purchase order.  The vendor should exercise prudent judgment in the choice of personnel working on the project.  Lower service rates should be charged where practicable to still achieve a quality product.


Safety and Health:

MSHA is dedicated to safety and health.  

It is of utmost importance that the training video depict safety and health procedures based on sound engineering, best industry practices, and OSHA and MSHA regulations and recommendations.  Where appropriate, concepts from ANSI Z10, Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems, should be incorporated into the training.  

The contractor is encouraged to suggest new or innovative safety and health concepts.  These must be clearly identified as such and accepted by MSHA prior to inclusion into the script.

All filming, especially of any staged fires, conducted at the contractor?s facility must be thoroughly planned.  The contractor must perform a risk assessment to identify hazards and necessary precautions.  All work must meet OSHA regulations.  Additional precautions may be necessary.  

POC IS ALEISHA MOORE AT MOORE.ALEISHA@DOL.GOV OR FAX TO 304-256-3350. NO PHONE CALLS ACCEPTED. QUESTIONS ARE DUE BY 7/27/2007.

<DESC>This request is an announcement for information/market research for planning purposes.  The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, invitation for bid nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.

The 526 ICBMSW/PKA, Hill AFB, Utah, is seeking potential sources to provide, deliver, install, test, and demonstrate an ion mill at Axsys Technologies, Cullman, AL. The ion mill performs an etching process by accelerating ions from a gas into a collimated beam and directing it to towards a work piece.  The accelerated ions impact the work piece and material is subsequently removed at a controlled rate on a molecular level generating an exposed pattern. 
This Defense application uses an ion mill to support the Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer (16-PIGA) and GI-T1-B Gyroscope manufacturing process for etching the precision grooves in the 16-PIGA Al2O3 wheel?s shaft and thrust plates as well as the GI-T1-B thrust pads.  The current etching process is performed by a Veeco model 301 Ion Mill.  Milling consists of etching grooves that are 35-50 millionths of an inch deep with extremely tight tolerances.  The machining is so precise that there is zero room for error. This etching process is critical to the production and repair of the 16-PIGA float build in support to the Minuteman Weapon System.  The parts are made of I-400 Beryllium, a hazardous material with stringent safety requirements.  Close coordination with Axsys is essential to ensure that all facility requirements are met.  Requirements will include procuring an ion mill, developing a process to ion mill grooves on the 16-PIGA shaft, thrust plates and the GI-T1-B thrust pads and re-qualifying the 16-PIGA float and GI-T1-B wheels.  Contract work must demonstrate the ion mill system robustness, repeatability and transition into production.  Proper integration of these parts into the next higher assembly is critical to the performance of these inertial instruments.

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPORSALS (RFP).  Firms responding to this announcement should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business.  Potential offerors should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) that addresses the offerors ability to provide the above requested unit. The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.

SOCs may be submitted by facsimile at 801-775-2116; e-mail: dustin.huler@hill.af.mil; or mailed to 6014 Dogwood Ave, Bldg 1258, rm 26 Hill AFB Ut 84056-5816, Attention: Dustin Huler.  Responses must be received not later than close of business (COB) 4:00pm  1 Oct, 2007.  Identify your response with the corresponding Program Title: Sources Sought: Ion Mill.

<SUBJECT>D -- ***ATTENTION CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE*** TO IT PROPOSALS DUE DATE AND IT SELECTION DATE: Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) 2008
<DESC>1. This announcement is for the Coalition Warrior     Interoperability Demonstration 2008 (CWID 2008) scheduled for 27 May through 20 Jun 08. Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services and Department of Defense (DoD) Agencies (C/S/As), government agencies outside the DoD, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and national participants outside the United States (U.S.) must submit Interoperability Trial (IT) proposals for CWID by 05 Oct 07 (***Please note date change/extension.) Industry partners must work through a C/S/A or government agency sponsor from outside the DoD to submit ITs. Complete details on CWID, to include references and submission instructions for ITs, are found at http://www.cwid.js.mil.
2. CWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event enabling the COCOMs, U.S. military services, U.S. national civil authorities and the multinational coalition community to discover and investigate command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions which focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing Coalition, COCOM, Service, Agency (C/C/S/A) interoperability and information sharing while exploring new partnerships. U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), on behalf of the Chairman, is responsible for the oversight of the CWID program. CWID focuses on net-centric solutions to identified C4ISR gaps that the traditional DoD acquisition process is not addressing. Gaps are identified in the CWID objectives and reflect immediate and near term (less than 24 months) capability needs. CWID analyzes the technical functionality, security features, and military utility of submitted IT proposals within the construct of the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System. C/S/As are highly encouraged to conduct further investigation into the tactics, techniques, and procedures using CWID as a vehicle. CWID is also an appropriate venue for spiral development, risk reduction, or validation of fielded/near-fielded commercial and/or DoD systems when appropriate to reduce fielding costs or transition timelines.
3. U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) is the host COCOM for CWID 2008 and develops the simulated operational scenario. The scenario focuses on exercising military coalition task force (CTF) responsibilities in conjunction with U.S. Northern Command?s (USNORTHCOM) Homeland Security/Homeland Defense (HS/HD) initiatives, and increasing/enhancing involvement,integration, and interoperability with allies in USEUCOM?s area of responsibility (AOR). Coalition participation remains the cornerstone of CWID and the anticipated international participants include: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO. In addition, COCOMs may invite nations, with prior Joint Staff approval, from within their respective AOR to participate as multinational task force members. USNORTHCOM will continue its CWID transformational efforts by investigating HS/HD applicable systems integration and interoperability solutions. USNORTHCOM?s coalition partners include US and Canadian military, government and civil agencies (e.g., Department of Homeland Security, Canada Command, Public Safety Emergency Preparedness Canada).
4. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for the validation of C4ISR solutions. Depending on the demonstrated capabilities and based on the criteria set forth in the CWID Additional Information document (published on the CWID website), each IT will be categorized into one of three tiers at IT selection and may receive one or more of the following assessments: Warfighter/Operator, Technical/Interoperability, and/or Information Assurance assessment. ITs must have a sponsor and must address one or more of the objectives. Tier I trials are ready-to-field, mature technology solutions or components of current Programs of Record (POR) or operational systems. ITs related to current operational Command and Control (C2) systems may include test cases as defined in Interoperability Operational Test Requirements and Information Exchange Requirements. Tier II trials are technology solutions that possess sufficient maturity to participate, but may require additional development before fielding. Tier III trials are site demonstrations that support a CWID objective, but do not warrant a formal CWID assessment. The CWID Senior Management Group (SMG) categorizes the ITs at selection and the CWID Joint Management Office (JMO) Assessment Working Group (AWG) and Systems Engineering and Integration Working Group (SEIWG) coordinate and conduct the assessments. Results from the assessments are documented in the CWID Final Report. 
5. To be selected, each proposed IT must address one or more of the CWID objectives and sub-objectives listed in paragraph 7 and commit to provide all funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, and documentation necessary to participate at one or more execution locations. The CWID SMG will select IT proposals on how well the IT?s proposal satisfies one or more of the objectives and sub-objectives and the need to share and exchange critical, time-sensitive information between military organizations, international coalitions and civilian agencies. The selection criteria are specified in the CWID Additional Information document. ITs must be submitted with a DoD or government sponsor in the format outlined on the CWID web site.     
6. ITs are hosted on the Combined Federated Battle Lab Network (CFBLNET), a worldwide secure network, enabling classified, releasable data to be exchanged among the CFBLNET participants. The CWID JMO coordinates, engineers, and supervises the network and the information domains for the worldwide venue. The CWID hardware and software demonstrations support the overall Network Centric Warfare construct. During the CWID execution phase, IT activities will be conducted over the CFBLNET, which supports military and coalition operations while providing the infrastructure to facilitate the military?s role in providing Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA). 
7. The 2008 Objectives, developed by USJFCOM, are supported by sub-objectives that reference clearly defined U.S. COCOM and coalition capability gaps and service inputs. The objectives are linked to the USJFCOM and COCOM Integrated Priority Lists, the USJFCOM Transformation Roadmap, USJFCOM C2 Capability Portfolio Management (C2 CPM) initiative and other coalition and Joint Staff source documentation. The objectives reflect the following recurring themes:
	a.       Discovering and investigating emerging and relevant coalition information sharing technologies,
	b.       Focus on demonstrating solutions for COCOM theater capability gaps and challenges, and
	c.       Enhance multi-service, multinational, and inter-agency cooperation and communication.
	
These process improvements facilitate post-CWID execution efforts to develop strategies aimed at responsibly bringing technology solutions to the DoD Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) community for consideration.     
	Scope: All multinational (to include DoD and non-DoD entities) information sharing solutions should be built on a foundation that is net-centric, secure, scalable, and bandwidth sensitive.
		
	Objective 1
	Improve Coalition and Joint C4ISR Architecture. This objective will enhance leadership?s capability to command, control and coordinate across joint & coalition forces, government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and first responders. Technologies will:
	a.       Demonstrate cohesive C2 linkages between military, government agencies and coalition partners. 
	b.       Demonstrate enhanced interoperability for NATO Response Force C2. 
	c.       Demonstrate open & secure mobile C2 capabilities between communities of interest (COIs).
	d.       Demonstrate communication tools that streamline decision-making and integrate with existing systems or that present entirely new solutions.
	e.       Demonstrate communication tools that share Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Explosive (CBRNE) contingency information with first responders & emergency services.
	f.       Demonstrate improved general Identification and Blue Force tracking capabilities,
	g.       Demonstrate counter insurgency Indications and Warning tools.
	h.       Demonstrate targeting tools for non-lethal weapons and corresponding Margin of Error,     
	i.       Demonstrate systems to rapidly extend communications in support of Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations.
	j.       Demonstrate tools to support neutralization of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).
	k.       Demonstrate expanded integration of open-source tools to open standards Service Oriented Architectures.
	l.       Demonstrate tools to support the entire deployment process from requirements identification through force closure, including redeployment and rotational operations.
	Explanation: Improved C4ISR Architecture will aid coalition, military and civilian authorities to harness the power of their respective information environments to execute collaboratively operations even in a bandwidth-constrained environment. Operations require an information environment that is not only scaleable, but one that spans multiple COIs and a variety of legacy C2 equipment. These COIs may be populated and maintained by military or civil agencies or a combination of both and it is likely they will be bandwidth-constrained. The information exchange between these COIs must be accomplished in such a way that it inspires confidence at each activity that the information is being disseminated securely, and will only be available to the agreed upon and authorized participants.     Solutions to achieve this data dissemination, across and within COIs, should consider the use of existing, approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.         
	
	Objective 2
	Improve Information Sharing across the full Range of Civil and Military Operations. Provide the capability to share information across multiple networks of potentially different security classifications and caveats. Emphasis should be on passing information to both U.S. controlled, coalition networks such as U.S. Central Command?s Combined enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) and coalition/alliance controlled networks such as NATO?s Initial Data Transfer System, NATO Mission Wide Area Network, or releasable to Republic of Korea. Data sharing encompasses the need for cross-domain solutions (CDS) and the assurance that information passed through CDS can be utilized by systems within all security enclaves. The criteria used to determine whether data can be shared should also focus on existing doctrine and/or policy-based information management and implement robust information assurance capabilities to protect data. Military and coalition operations require CDS devices to permit collaboration with first responders, NGOs, state and local governments as well as information sharing. Technologies will:
	a.       Demonstrate multi-level security & multi-domain applications that promote information sharing with planned and unanticipated mission partners.
	b.       Demonstrate effective network defense applications to protect shared data.
	c.       Demonstrate tools that improve utility, accuracy and timeliness of real time translation for collaboration in specific areas of responsibility. 
	d.       Demonstrate complementary planning tools that support military, local law enforcement, first responders, governmental, non-governmental and coalition planning activities.
	e.       Demonstrate tools to improve Request for Forces process.
	f.       Demonstrate tools to improve deployment and visibility of coalition and/or interagency/Private Voluntary Organization (PVO)/NGO forces.
	g.       Demonstrate use of free-ware and share-ware open standards capabilities to fully connect civilian and military planners.
	Explanation: Coalition operations require an information environment that spans multiple COIs. These COIs may be mobile, fixed or remotely located where the combination of military and/or civil agencies is likely to be affected by limited bandwidth. Within any COI, mission success relates to the commander?s C2 ability to communicate directly with individual users or first responders who may be detached from fixed information domains. Decision makers and/or first responders require interoperable, reliable, clear and/or secure wireless capabilities to receive and transmit critical voice, data, and video information to support the Network Centric warfare construct. Solutions to achieve improved C2 between diverse COIs should consider the use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use. A major challenge to achieving a single integrated cross domain solution is the development of a method, strategy, and universal standard for electronically marking or labeling classification and release caveats of documents and information streams.     Since recent directives require DoD systems to use eXtensible Markup Language (XML) for data exchange, there is a need for XML-based technology that can provide a robust and secure method for marking classification and release caveats of documents and information streams.
	
	Objective 3
	Enhance Cross Domain and Multiple Security Level Information Exchange Tools. Provide CDS and multi-lingual translation solutions that improve the commander's ability to share intelligence information products (documents, images, databases, etc.) with coalition partners, including joint and coalition forces, government agencies, NGOs and first responders. Technologies will:
	a.       Demonstrate data fusion tools that support cross domain information sharing and consolidates multiple sources of information into a single reference source.
	b.       Demonstrate situational awareness tools that disseminate and display time critical information for tactical forces and first responders to include defense against IEDs.
	c.       Demonstrate visualization and integration tools that can simultaneously manage multiple Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance inputs.
	d.       Demonstrate capabilities to enhance Maritime Domain Awareness between Federal, State and local agencies.
	Explanation: Cross domain and multiple security level information exchange represent more than providing a common operational picture at the strategic or major echelon level of command.Exchange tools must be secure, scaleable in scope and functional within the theater bandwidth available at all levels of warfare. Trial proposals should be capable of using existing interface standards and protocols that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data. Solutions must support each nation?s disclosure and release policies as well as provide a secure means of consistently communicating accurate information in a multi-lingual military and/or local authority context. Possible information to exchange includes: directive commentary, visualization of the battlespace, friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, three dimensional imagery, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) map data, equipment status, scaleable intelligence estimates, personnel movements and other intelligence related products. A key subset to creating and sustaining a coalition information sharing environment is that users must be able to consistently and securely access, extract and utilize common information derived from dissimilar databases across multiple domains. Tools to translate documents, displays, and written/audio-exchanges between planners and end-users, is a necessity for successful operations at the military, agency, and other government organization levels.     
	
	Objective 4
	Enhance Integrated Logistics Planning and Coordination Tools. Demonstrate the ability to access, consolidate and display logistical information to include movement, location and status of joint forces, military services, interagency, coalition, NGO, first responders as well as equipment and supplies in near real time across organizational boundaries.     Technologies will:
	a.       Demonstrate secure abilities to assess & display information regarding the movement, location, & status of Coalition equipment & personnel.
	b.       Demonstrate logistics data access, fusion, & integration among COIs.
	c.       Demonstrate Logistic data sharing for medical and health protection services.       
	d.       Demonstrate capability to exchange logistic data between government agencies, NGOs and military systems.
	Explanation: Within the information environment of coalition, military and non-military operations, the commander must have responsive and effective logistics. Logistical data is contained within diverse logistics information systems maintained by the military and civilian agencies across the coalition. Access to that data implies combining total asset visibility and information during the transit of friendly forces into a single information presentation available across multiple information COIs. Solutions should address the locating and fusion of logistics information feeds as part of the commander?s general situation awareness. Solutions to achieve CWID objectives should consider the use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations or propose new approaches that are progressing toward operational security certification.
	
	Objective 5
	Enhance Government Agency Interoperability.       Provide solutions that improve the Combatant Commander?s ability to conduct collaborative planning with coalition partners, including joint and coalition forces, government agencies, NGOs and first responders. Focus on enhanced collaboration and engendering a ?need to share? vice a ?need to know? culture.     Technologies will:
	a.       Demonstrate data access, fusion & integration among joint forces, international, Federal and State Agencies & local law enforcement.
	b.       Demonstrate the ability to distribute and track key policy and strategy documents (memorandum of agreement, memorandum of understanding, standard operating procedures, industry standard architecture) between government agencies. 
	c.       Demonstrate tools to improve Information Assurance and posture between government agencies.
	d.       Demonstrate a situational awareness tool that uses advanced visualization technologies capable of integrating existing systems into one common operational picture, 
	e.       Demonstrate a Blue Force tracking capability for first responders.
	f.       Demonstrate computer network defense capabilities to support non-military partners,
	g.       Demonstrate computer network capabilities that support collaboration with the Department Homeland Security Emergency Management COI.
	h.       Demonstrate multi-lingual interoperability between international agency systems and DoD, multinational systems to support Global Disaster Relief efforts.
	Explanation: Collaborative planning and dissemination of products in a bandwidth constrained environment horizontally across and vertically within COIs is an emerging issue for the warfighter, particularly as software and procedure tools become sufficiently robust to be extended from the operational to the tactical level of warfare. The lack of robust planning and collaboration tools makes it difficult to provide the commander timely and complete information on which to develop decisions.  Communications in a CWID context is interpreted as ?coalition information sharing,? and is more than providing a radio communication or common operational picture at or between the strategic, operational, or tactical level of command. It must be secure, scaleable in scope and functional within the theater bandwidth available at all levels of warfare. Solutions must support each nation?s disclosure and release policies as well as provide a secure means of consistently communicating accurate information in a multi-lingual military and/or local authority context. Possible information exchanges include: directive commentary, friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, GIS map data, equipment status, personnel movements and other intelligence related products. A key subset to creating and sustaining a coalition information-sharing environment is that users must be able to consistently and securely access, extract and utilize common information derived from dissimilar databases across multiple domains. Further, coalition operations are routinely conducted with multiple nations and organizations that are challenged with using a common language. A tool to translate documents, displays, and written/audio-exchanges between planners and end-users, is a requirement of operations at the military, agency, and other government organization levels.     Inherent in this requirement is the need to fuse dissimilar information and extract specific data sets while providing reliable language translations for communicating guidance to coalition partners.

<SUBJECT>70 -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO SAVVIS FEDERAL SYSTEMS
<DESC>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) intends to award a sole source contract, for a one year base and two (2) one year option periods, to SAVVIS Federal Systems for managed hosting services within East Coast and West Coast data centers.  

_____BACKGROUND-The NLRB is in the process of consolidating all distributed information technology resources ? e.g., file, print, and email services, and an enterprise case management solution ? into two hosted data centers.  The NLRB currently has a data center hosted by SAVVIS in Sterling, VA, that serves as the East Coast facility.  A second data center will be added to serve the West Coast offices and enable the OCIO?s disaster recovery plans in the near future.  Approximately 1,900 NLRB users will be affected by the consolidation effort. 

Presently, there are 56 Novell Netware servers located in the NLRB?s 52 Regional offices and the headquarters office (HQ) in Washington, DC.  As the NLRB plans to migrate all data from the 56 Novell Netware servers to NAS and/or SAN devices located at the data center(s), the Agency recently released an RFQ for Network Attached Storage. 

Likewise, there are currently 23 servers supporting current distributed and stand alone legacy case management systems; six (6) remote servers supporting the NLRB?s Microsoft Exchange platform; and six (6) remote servers supporting the NLRB?s Microsoft SMS platform.  The consolidated enterprise case management solution will be based on Oracle?s Siebel customer relationship management platform and EMC?s document management platform, both of which will utilize Microsoft SQL Server.  The enterprise case management solution, Exchange and SMS platforms will be consolidated in the existing data center. 

Finally, to facilitate the consolidation of its technical infrastructure, the Agency recently released an RFQ for Wide Area Network Optimization.  The selected devices will be installed in Regional offices, headquarters, and the data centers.

The objective of the Managed Hosting Services program is to continue the progress the OCIO has made in consolidating presently distributed information technology resources into hosted data centers, so as to provide the NLRB with effective and efficient information delivery with significantly improved technology management.

_____SCOPE- The scope of this Statement of Work is to procure managed data centers to host the NLRB?s consolidated information technology infrastructure, serving the Agency?s East and West Coast Offices and enabling the OCIO?s disaster recovery plans.

_____SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT - The technical and business requirements presented below, while based on current needs and, therefore, not all-inclusive, are critical to the project?s success.  These requirements fall into four categories: (1) network services, which provide the communications infrastructure supporting the program; (2) co-location services, which provide secure real estate, power, and monitoring for NLRB-owned or leased equipment; (3) utility services (Utility Compute, Utility Storage, Utility Compute ?Surge? capability, Virtual Intelligent Hosting, Virtual Server, Virtual Firewall), which affords the NLRB access to fully-managed processing and storage capacity; (4) support services, which provide support for the NLRB?s hosted environment, such as with program management and backup and recovery services.  Note that requirements listed as ?(optional)? are not currently utilized or quantified but are indicative of the services that may be required within the scope of this program.  The vendor shall use the existing infrastructure configuration for quantities and volume-discount calculations. Other Offerors shall contact the Agency to receive this information.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to Award a Modification to an Existing Contract
<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, on the behalf of the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), intends to award a modification to exercise Option Period Two of an existing contract with an increased leve l of effort (LOE).  The contract supports the U.S. Army Garrison (USAG) in the development of the National Interagency Biodefense Campus (NIBC).  The contract provides 1) technical support to enhance and facilitate the efforts of the U.S. Army Garrison to develop and implement an Enhanced Use Lease Project that will provide central utilities for the NIBC; 2) support to the follow-on phase of developing an Operations Requirements Document (ORD) that identifies the requirements that non- U.S. Army tenant agen cies must satisfy while operating and maintaining facilities at the NIBC; 3) technical support to enhance the efforts of the USAG to facilitate the development of the NIBC; 4) technical support to USAMRIID; and 5) a ground water supply utilization assessme nt of the NIBC.   The increase to the LOE is to 1) bring the scope of Option Year Two to the LOE of the current period of performance; 2) add a within-scope task and; 3) extend the performance period to 12 months.   The increased LOE to bring the scope of Option Year Two to the current LOE consists of increased support to enhance the efforts of the USAMRIID to facilitate the development of the USAMRIID replacement for decompression and expanded mission in new and existing facilities in the efforts.  The tas k being added to Option Year Two is an extension of a previously completed task to evaluate existing and proposed ground water resources and the current and proposed uses of this resource to determine if there are technically and economically viable uses f or available ground water resources at the USAG within current and proposed environmental regulations.  This modification is being issued in accordance with FAR 6.302.   Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requ irements.

The AECS/IDS, manufactured by Vindicator, provides automated entry access to authorized personnel and intrusion detection and notification. This system is spread across buildings 32, 34, 36, 37, and 91. Buildings 32, 34, 36, and 37 are connected while building 91 is separated from the main complex by approximately 1200 feet. All alarms from this system are reported to building 23020 (36SFS) on Andersen AFB proper. 

	1.3.1. Buildings 36 and 91 are each encircled by 14-foot high Perifield fences which provide detection of personnel and vehicles within 50 feet of the structures. Each Perifield fence includes one 20-foot wide infrared gate activated by IPIDS sensors. Each fence has two exterior FDB boxes that provide processing of the sensors and communication.  Total fencing is approximately 1,470 feet, has approximately 868 sensors.  

1.3.2. Buildings 36 and 91 each has five exterior cameras, one interior camera, one motion sensor, and an interior FDB box. At building 91, one tower on which two of the cameras are installed will require maintenance.  All other cameras are either mounted on towers maintained under another program or are affixed to lighting poles.

1.3.3. All FDB boxes provide communication into the Vindicator network on DET5 that ultimately reports to Andersen AFB at the 36SFS. All FDB boxes contain UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) systems. 

1.3.4. Between all buildings there are 13 entrances/exits that provide automated access and 5 entrances/exits that are alarmed only.  The combined access points employ 12 mag-locks, 1 electronic strike, 1 prox-reader, 13 prox-readers with keypads, 26 balanced magnetic switches, 12 egress button switches, and 15 MR-50 units for interface. These are all reported into the Vindicator system on DET5 and ultimately to 36SFS. 

1.3.5. There are three V-5 processors in the system, one located in each building 34, 36, and 91. Building 34 hosts the V-5 Intrusion and V-5 Access Control Servers, the AECS badge enrollment equipment, and the central interface rack for all the sensors and cameras.  This rack provides the central interface for the entire Vindicator network for DET5 and is the interface to 36SFS at Andersen AFB.

1.3.6. All Vindicator alarm indications are routed to building 23020 at 36SFS as the central monitoring and control point of the DET5 AECS/IDS.  Within this building are 4 IFS modules, an Allegiant Video System, a High Definition Video Digital Recorder, 3 video monitors, a keyboard, mouse, and a Trendnet media converter. This equipment allows viewing and control of alarms and cameras located at DET5. From this location 36SFS directs all security responses to unusual situations identified at DET5. 

1.3.7. This description may not be all-inclusive of equipment in the DET5 AECS/IDS but provides a basic inventory of what the system encompasses. There are additional media converters, video transmitters, fiber optics, etc., that enable the entire system to communicate and display information.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services/items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart  
12.6, as supplemented with additional information included with this notice. This announcement constitutes the only  
solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and  
incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-20 effective 06 September  
2007, DFAR DCN 20070906 and AFFAR AFAC 20070823.  This procurement is a 100% set aside for small business.  NAICS code is  
924110 for administration of air and water resource and solid waste management programs.  This is a requirement for shoreline  
stabilization consisting of construction of a shallow wave energy barrier.  Requirement:  STATEMENT OF WORK, Oyster Reef  
Shoreline Stabilization and Restoration Program.  1.0  BACKGROUND: The southeastern shoreline along MacDill AFB is rapidly  
eroding. The rate of erosion has been estimated to be approximately one foot per year. Shoreline erosion may be due to a  
number of factors including an increase in the size and volume of commercial ship traffic through Hillsborough and Tampa  
Bays.  Shoreline erosion has been observed at many locations throughout coastal areas around Tampa Bay.  Due to the steady  
shoreline erosion at MacDill, approximately 3,800 square feet of beach along a half mile of remnant coastal shoreline is lost  
annually.  Natural resources along the shoreline have begun to be impacted including the loss of mature coastal vegetation  
such as historic live oaks, black mangroves, and dense shore grass stands.  The loss of this vegetation represents a  
substantial loss of coastal habitat areas important to protected avian species and other wildlife.   To date, MacDill AFB has  
constructed two segments (permitted) of oyster reef along MacDill southeastern shoreline and has nearly completed  
construction of the third permitted segment.  The first segment, a demonstration project completed in 2004, was used to  
determine which configuration of oyster domes was most effective at reducing wave energy and stabilizing the shoreline.  The  
next two segments of permitted work focused on stabilizing the extreme southeast corner (Gadsden Point) of the base. MacDill  
AFB has secured funding from the Department of Defense (DOD) for all of the previously permitted work and has augmented the  
DOD funds through partnering efforts with other Federal, state and local resource agencies including the US Fish and Wildlife  
Service, Tampa Bay Estuary Program and the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County.  Securing grants and  
additional funding for the project has been a critical part of the projects success to date, and will remain essential for  
the long term success of this project. 2.0  SCOPE:  Stabilization of the MacDill AFB southeastern shoreline is being  
completed through construction of oyster reefs which form a shallow wave-energy barrier approximately 100 feet off-shore  
where the water is 1.5 to 2.0 feet deep at high tide.  The materials used to create the substructure for the oyster reef  
include pre-fabricated concrete oyster domes and oyster shell bags (constructed on site using fossilized oyster shell and  
nylon mesh ?bags?).  The pre-fabricated oyster domes are designed to reduce wave energy and encourage establishment of oyster  
and mussel beds/bars.  The oyster shell bags also encourage oyster and mussel colonization but do not provide as much  
vertical relief as the oyster domes.  Work on these segments started in 2005 and is expected to be finished in early 2008.   
This work is showing great signs of success.  MacDill intends to construct additional segments of oyster reef between fiscal  
year (FY) 2008 and FY2012 with the overall goal of stabilizing the entire shoreline south of the base wastewater treatment  
plant to the marina channel.  The area proposed for oyster reef stabilization is shown in attached Figures 1 and 2 and has  
been broken into segments for planning/programming purposes.
 
 
3.0 PROJECT PHASE SUMMARY:  Phase Left to Complete

4.0  Tasks Required for Each Phase:
4.1  Design, Obtain Permits, Monitor Project Plan:    Contractor is to prepare project design for the phase of work currently being permitted to include consultation and site visits (2) with the MacDill Environmental Flight (6 CEV) project officer.  Create design drawings sufficient to meet the requirement for the permit application packages. Permit and Monitoring requires Contractor to secure the necessary permits to construct section of reef for which the design was prepared.  Upon completion of the reef, contractor shall monitor the reef in accordance with permit requirements.
4.1.1  Permit:  Prepare permit application packages for permits from Florida Department of Environmental Protection, US Army Corps of Engineers, and Tampa Port Authority/Hillsborough County Environmental Protection Commission. Respond to any Request for Additional Information generated by the regulatory agencies for each permit package.  Contractor will be required to conduct site visits with each regulatory agency to show them previously accomplished and proposed new work. 
4.1.2	Monitoring:  Accomplish monitoring of newly installed reef system as
required by the permit (typically semi-annually for two years). Monitoring data shall be presented in spreadsheet format and provide to 6 CEV within 30 days of each monitoring event.  Monitoring data will include: 
4.1.2.a.  Measurement of sediment accumulation/loss behind the domes (a minimum of one monitoring point per 150 linear feet of reef);
4.1.2.b.  Average percent oyster recruitment (cover) on the domes;
4.1.2.c.  Average oyster size;
4.1.2.d.Documentation of any sighting of marine life on/around the reef; and
4.1.2.e.Document if invasive aquatic species are present (primarily green mussel).  
4.1.3  Furnish Reef Building Materials:  Furnish all oyster reef building materials necessary to accomplish the permitted design for each phase.  Reef building materials will be marine-friendly concrete oyster domes (either Lo-Pro Reef Balls or larger Bay-Ball and Pallet-Ball Reef Balls) and fossilized oyster shell from local sources.  The purchase of materials shall include the cost for delivery of the materials to MacDill AFB.  For the Lo-Pro Reef Balls, the material will be delivered on a trailer to an upland site adjacent to the proposed reef building area.  For the Pallet-Ball Reef Balls, the material will be delivered on a barge.  For the fossilized oyster shell, the material will be delivered to an asphalt parking lot in the MacDill AFB marina approximately ?-mile from the reef building site.

FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items.

Offers shall be signed and dated and show the date/time specified in the RFP for receipt of offers; the name, address, telephone number and email address of the administrative point of contact for the offeror; acknowledgement of solicitation amendments, if applicable; and the period for acceptance of the offer (minimum of 30 days required).     

The Offeror shall address the following factors in their proposal:

(1) Factor 1: Price: The price proposal will be evaluated for completeness to ensure a price has been submitted for all CLIN/SLINs.  All proposals will be evaluated for unbalanced pricing. Offerors are cautioned that unbalanced unit prices may be grounds for exclusion of a proposal from consideration for award.  The Government will determine a total evaluated price for each Schedule proposed based upon known Government requirements for the five-year ordering period at the time of proposal evaluation.  The Offeror shall complete the pricing in the Section B for a five-year ordering period for the item(s) proposed.  Offerors shall propose range order quantities and unit pricing for the applicable CLINs to maximize economies of scale using stepladder pricing (e.g., 1-10 ea, 11-20 ea, 20-30 ea, etc.).

(2) Factor 2: Technical: The Offeror?s technical proposal shall provide documented evidence of the Offeror?s capability to meet all technical requirements stated herein. Offerors shall provide product literature, cut sheets, and any other information deemed necessary to evaluate the item being proposed.  The Government will evaluate each item offered by comparing the information provided to the specifications and capabilities identified in this combined synopsis/solicitation and make a determination as to whether or not that item meets all the requirements. Any exception to the Government's technical requirements must be included in the technical proposal and clearly delineated in a cover letter to the technical proposal. 

(3)  Factor:  Past Performance.   Offerors shall provide three references to include contract numbers, POC, POC phone numbers for contracts of similar size and scope.     

52.212-2 Addendum to Evaluation Commercial Items

(a) Basis for Award.  Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. 

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

(1) Factor 1: Price: Price reasonableness shall be determined through competitive commercial market prices and IAW the guidelines set forth in FAR 15.404-1.

(2) Factor 2: Technical. The Government will evaluate the Offeror?s technical proposal for documented evidence of meeting all or most of the technical requirements as stated in the solicitation. A proposal shall be considered unacceptable if it fails to meet ALL the pass/fail technical criteria as stated below.

Pass/Fail Criteria: The contractor shall meet ALL the following, exceptions noted. 

(a) minimum computing specifications with the exception of the ruggedized uninterruptible power supply which is annotated as an OPTION;

(b)  software requirements; and,

(c)  other hardware and interface requirements with the exception of MTU GUI Display capability and TLI Interface Card/GUI Display which is annotated as an OPTION.

(3)  Factor 3:  Past Performance:  Offerors will be evaluated to determine that they have successfully completed similar work on time and within budget.  

(b) Standard Commercial Warranty:  The Contractor shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government.  Acceptance of the standard commercial does not waive the Government?s rights under the ?Inspection? clause nor does it limit the Government?s rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract.  In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the standard commercial warranty.  The standard commercial warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable material and/or services listed in the Schedule.

<DESC>The Coast Guard intends to award a "Sole Source Contract" for the purchase of Two Way Satellite Timing Transfer System, (hardware only, consisting of ATS 6502 w/daughter cards, and interface cards. This was initially prototyped under the Loran TFE System and requires a timing synchronization requirement that the LORAN signal be synchronized within 20 ns (RMS) of UTC(USNO) at the point of transmission. The USCG has been working on a two-way time transfer solution for time recovery at the transmitting stations.  Two-way time transfer is a GPS independent technique that can easily meet the 20 ns (RMS) specification.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:

1. Requiring Authority:  60 CS, Mr. Kirby

2.  Contracting Agency:  60th Contracting Squadron, Travis AFB CA
     
3.  Purchase Request #:  F3Z3517238AC01

4.  Description of Requirement:  25 Motorola XTS-5000 Land Mobile Radios and necessary hardware and software required for them to be compatible with the Travis AFB Trunked Land Mobile Radio (TLMR) System.

5.  Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by: FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  Only one brand name and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.

6.  Justification or Authority for action:

(a.)	Currently, Motorola Inc. is the only manufacturer of radio equipment that meets NSA?s policy guidance for the keying material program for the Astro Digital XTS-5000 radio using the AES 256 Type encryption.

(b.)	Motorola Inc. is the only known brand that can satisfy the Government?s requirement for compatibility with the existing system on base.  60 CS needs encryptable LMR systems, consisting of the proposed Motorola equipment list, to be programmed by Motorola so it is compatible with the existing base trunking system valued at 7 million dollars.  Also, the radios need ruggedized housing that can be submersible to 6?, and this is only available through Motorola.

(c.)	Without these radios, 60 CS personnel would not be able to access the base trunking system and communicate with their work control centers, each other, and the rest of the base necessary to perform the mission.

7.   Market Research/ Other Facts:  The only other manufacturer of radios capable of operating on the TLMR system are manufactured by EF Johnson however they are not NSA certified for use with the AES encryption key. 
	
8. Brand Name:  Motorola Inc. 

9.  Steps to improve competition:  Market research will continue to be conducted.  Until such time that other vendors produce equipment meeting NSA?s policy guidance, Motorola Inc. will remain the brand name provider.  

10. Certification:  I hereby certify that the above information is complete and accurate.

Statement of Work for Commercial Lease of Administrative Vehicles
U. S. Department of State
(A/OPR/GSM/FMO)

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Continuous long term (e.g., twelve consecutive months or longer) lease of administrative vehicles.

VEHICLE SUMMARY
The general types of vehicles required shall be as follows:
	Automobiles/Sedans: sub-compact, compact, mid-size, large executive, premium executive
	Passenger Vans: seven to fifteen passenger, front-wheel or all-wheel drive when available
	Cargo Vans: compact and full-size
	Pick Up Trucks: compact, mid- and full-sizes, 2- and 4-door, standard and extended cab, 4x2 and 4x4
	Sport Utility Vehicles: compact, mid- and full-sizes, 2- and 4-door, 4x2 and 4x4

The DOS will specify vehicle type and desired options on each call; Lessor may provide any manufacturer model vehicle that meets both DOS requirements and Buy American Act regulations.  Vehicles may be any color (black, dark blue, or white preferred), with the exception that large executive and premium executive sedans must be black or dark blue.  

Vehicles will be provided with flexible fuel gas/ethanol (E85) capability when available from manufacturers in the type and class of vehicle ordered.  Hybrid electric vehicles and vehicles operating on alternative fuels, such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or propane, are acceptable when available from manufacturers in the type and class of vehicle ordered, but must be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). It is the DOS's intent to burn biodiesel fuel in any diesel-powered vehicle provided by the Lessor, unless specifically prohibited by the vehicle manufacturer; it is the Lessor's responsibility to notify the COR of any such prohibitions prior to accepting the call for the vehicle.  The Lessor will not provide 4x4 vehicles unless specifically ordered or approved in advance by the COR.

LEASE TERMS
Basic Agreement Period: The BPA shall be valid for one base year with two one-year options. 

General: In response to this request for proposal (RFP), the Lessor will provide a price schedule for all vehicle types the Lessor will make available under this BPA; the Lessor's price proposal will become a formal part of the BPA upon award. While the Lessor is not required to provide a price schedule for every vehicle type listed above, the Lessor must include a price proposal for large executive and premium executive four-door sedans as a minimum. 

The DOS will initially lease individual vehicles for twelve (12) consecutive months; each individual lease may be extended in one-month or multiple-month intervals thereafter, not to exceed 36 months in total.  Prior to expiration of any given lease period as specified in the call, the Contracting Officer (CO) will issue a formal modification to extend the lease if needed; the modification will specify the number of additional months and the corresponding price per month as specified in the Lessor's price schedule. 

There is no guaranteed minimum quantity that the DOS will order.

Ordering: As requirements arise, the COR will notify the Lessor of desired vehicle types, quantities, specifications and lease duration by fax or email, based on vehicle types offered in the Lessor's proposal. Within two business days of receipt of a request from the COR, the Lessor will notify the COR (by return fax or email) of vehicle availability and delivery lead-time for each vehicle requested.  The Lessor may offer and the COR may accept substitution of specific vehicle types/options other than those initially requested by the COR when agreed to by the COR in advance and at no additional cost to the government.  Upon determination by the COR that the Lessor's response is satisfactory to meet requirements, the Contracting Officer (CO) will issue a formal call against the BPA for the agreed upon vehicle(s) at the price specified in the Lessor's price schedule. The Lessor will then provide vehicles to the COR within 15 days of issuance of the call by the CO, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the Lessor and the COR, in which case a not later than delivery date will be specified in the call. The Lessor will not provide vehicles to the COR until directed to do so by the CO via formal BPA call.

Extensions: Individual vehicle leases may be extended on a month-to-month or multiple-month basis by modification to the initial call prior to expiration of the call.  Existing calls may be extended and new calls may be issued up until the last day of the BPA base year or option year.  In those cases where the end of the period of performance specified in a call falls after the end of the BPA base/option year, the vehicle lease will terminate at the end of the period of performance specified in the individual call.  

Pricing:  For each vehicle type offered, the Lessor will provide a price schedule that includes standard per-month rates for months 1-12, months 13-24 and months 25-36. The DOS will issue calls for vehicle leases for any period of time ranging from twelve to 36 months, and will reimburse the Lessor the applicable rate for each month of the lease as specified in the Lessor's price schedule. (As a practical example, if the DOS issues a call for a vehicle lease for a 16 month period, the first twelve months will be invoiced/reimbursed at the monthly rate specified for months 1-12, and the next four months will be reimbursed at the rates specified for months 13-24.  Likewise, a 26 month lease will be invoiced/reimbursed at the rate specified for months 1-12 during the first twelve months, at the rates specified for months 13-24 for the next twelve months, and at the rates specified for months 25-36 for the last two months.) This rate structure will apply for all vehicles continuously leased by the DOS with no contractual break in service. For the purposes of this requirement, vehicles replaced during the specified lease period at the Lessor's discretion, because of maintenance problems, or due to age and mileage stipulations contained in other parts of this agreement, will be considered to be continuous, uninterrupted leases. 
Prices specified in the schedule will include no-charge mileage allowances available to the Lessor's best customers. Charges for cumulative mileage beyond Lessor-defined annual limits, if any, will be clearly defined in the Lessor's proposal. Finally, discounts for prompt payment will be defined in the Lessor's proposal.

Vehicle Replacements: The DOS may, at its option, require replacement of any vehicle that reaches three years of age or 45,000 miles during the agreed upon lease period, with the exception that the DOS may require replacement of large executive and premium executive sedans that reach two years of age or 30,000 miles. If this occurs, the Lessor will provide the replacement vehicle to the DOS for the remainder of the period specified in the call at no additional charge, and the replacement vehicle will be considered a continuous, uninterrupted lease as defined above. The Lessor may not replace any vehicle during the first 12-months of any lease period unless agreed upon in advance by the COR.

Termination:  
	General: Any vehicle(s) leased prior to the BPA expiration date will be retained by the DOS for the entire period of performance specified in the call regardless of the expiration date of the BPA; all terms and conditions of the BPA will remain in full force until the end of the lease period specified in each individual call.

	Grace Period:  At the end of each lease period, the Lessor will grant DOS a five workday grace period for DOS to ready the vehicle for return to the Lessor.  The Lessor will not charge DOS any lease fees during the grace period. Should the DOS fail to return the vehicle by the end of the grace period, the Lessor will be entitled to pro-rata payment for each day past the five-workday grace period (see Payments below). For the purposes of this requirement, a workday is defined as Monday through Friday, not including days the federal government is closed for business. 

	Delivery & Pick Up: The Lessor will deliver vehicles at the beginning of each lease period and retrieve vehicles at the end of each lease period at a location that is no more than 10 miles from the Main State building, located at 2201 C Street NW, Washington, DC 20520, unless otherwise agreed upon in advance by the Lessor and the COR. The cost of such delivery and retrieval shall be included in the Lessor's final price proposal.  The Lessor's responsibility for delivery shall be met when the Lessor notifies the COR that the vehicle is ready for pick up by the DOS at the agreed upon location. The DOS's responsibility for return of vehicles shall be met when the COR notifies the Lessor that the vehicle is available for pick up by the Lessor at the agreed upon location.

INVOICES AND PAYMENTS
Invoices: The Lessor will send invoices to the COR by the 10th day of each calendar month for each vehicle leased the previous calendar month.    The Lessor will bill monthly for all leases, regardless of the length of the lease specified in the call. Invoices shall clearly specify the vehicle ID number and all associate charges for the month. The Lessor will specify all credits and any applicable discounts offered to the DOS for prompt payment on each invoice.

Payments: DOS will verify and submit invoices for payment upon receipt from the Lessor. If it becomes necessary for any reason to determine a daily or monthly rate for pro-rata invoice adjustments, a daily rate will be determined by dividing the monthly rate specified in the call by 30 days. 

Charges for excess mileage beyond Lessor-defined annual limits and discount credits for prompt payment, if any, will be clearly identified on each invoice.  Excess mileage charges will be authorized for payment when such charges are in accordance with the Lessor's proposal and determined to be customary and reasonable by the COR. 


MAINTENANCE & REPAIRS 
The Lessor shall provide routine preventive maintenance (lubrication, oil/filter changes, replacement wipers and bulbs, etc.), breakdown maintenance/repairs, safety/emissions tests/inspections, and road-side assistance at no additional cost to DOS.  The Lessor will notify DOS when each vehicle is due for preventive maintenance, inspection or repair, and where the vehicle should be taken to obtain the required service.  DOS will deliver the vehicle to the designated maintenance facility as soon as possible for essential repairs (e.g., items due to manufacturer safety recall or that may cause damage to the equipment or a safety hazard for the operator or occupants) and within 10 work days of notice for non-essential service, and will retrieve the vehicle from that location upon notice from the vendor or Lessor that maintenance has been completed. The DOS will not have any repairs made to any vehicle without prior approval of the Lessor.

The Lessor will pay all fees and charges associated with vehicle towing, maintenance, repairs and inspections directly to the vendor performing the service. Lessor-designated maintenance facilities shall be within 10 miles of the Main State building, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Lessor and the COR. DOS will pay all normal operating expenses, including gasoline, oil, and tolls and parking fees.

The Lessor will provide a temporary replacement loaner vehicle, similar to the original vehicle, for any vehicle that will be out of service for maintenance or repairs for more than three consecutive business days; such loaner vehicles will be provided for the entire time period the original vehicle is out of service after the third day, and at no additional charge to the DOS.  The Lessor will provide a permanent replacement vehicle for any vehicle that will be out of service for more than ten consecutive workdays or that is out of service for breakdown repairs on more than three occasions during any twelve month period. Such permanent replacement vehicles will be provided for the remainder of the original vehicle lease period, and at no additional charge to the DOS; in these instances, the replacement vehicle shall meet the same specifications as the vehicle being replaced, unless differences in specifications are agreed upon in advance by the COR, and will be considered a continuation of the original lease for pricing purposes.

LICENSING FEES AND TAXES
Lessor shall pay all vehicle title, registration and licensing fees, charges and taxes.

LICENSE PLATES
All vehicles provided by the Lessor will be properly licensed, at the Lessor's expense, in accordance with procedures specified by the state in which the vehicle is registered.  The DOS reserves the right to replace Lessor vehicle license plates with official federal government vehicle license plates.  The DOS will ensure the security of license plates removed from Lessor vehicles and will replace the Lessor plates on the vehicle prior to return to the Lessor at the end of the lease period. 

INSURANCE
As a self-insured entity, the DOS shall be responsible for all repairs, or reimbursement for same to the Lessor, for any non-normal wear and tear or other damage sustained by the vehicle while in possession of the DOS. In the event DOS chooses to reimburse the Lessor for the cost of repairs  greater than $500, the DOS will reimburse the Lessor in an amount equal to the lesser of two commercial repair estimates, or the average of three commercial repair estimates obtained by the Lessor and provided to the COR. For repairs of $500 or less, the DOS will repair the vehicle or reimburse the Lessor based on one commercial repair estimate provided by the Lessor.  Repair or reimbursement will be at the COR's discretion.

For the purposes of this requirement, vehicles will be considered to be in the possession of the DOS from the time the DOS takes physical possession of the vehicle at the designated drop off point at the beginning of the lease period until the time the DOS delivers the vehicle to the designated drop off point at the end of the lease period, not including the time the vehicle is at a Lessor-designated maintenance/repair facility, during which time any damages to the vehicle will be addressed between the Lessor and the Lessor-designated repair facility. Drop off locations are addressed above, in the sub-paragraph entitled Delivery & Pick Up.


VEHICLE SPECIFICATIONS
Lessors will respond to DOS's request for vehicles with a description of the vehicle (e.g., make, model, year of manufacture, body style, color, odometer reading, etc.) it proposes to provide to meet the DOS's requirement.  As a minimum, all vehicles will be provided with features, equipment, safety features and accessories defined by the vehicle's manufacturer as standard.  If the Lessor chooses to provide vehicles with additional features or comfort and convenience items not specifically requested by the DOS (such as high performance engines, heavy duty alternators,  heated seats, dual zone air conditioning, remote keyless entry, alarm system, etc.), such features will be provided at no additional cost to the DOS.  If the DOS requires features beyond those defined as standard, the COR will obtain availability, delivery lead-time and itemized price surcharge information for each additional feature from the Lessor prior to submitting a formal call for the vehicle; in the event the DOS eventually orders the vehicle, the call will specify the desired additional features and the authorized surcharge amount that the Lessor may add to the basic monthly rate specified for that vehicle in the price schedule.

The Lessor will furnish to the DOS two (2) sets of vehicle keys, including remote keyless entry fobs if the vehicle is so equipped, which will be returned to the Lessor at lease termination.  The DOS will be responsible for the replacement of lost or damaged keys and remote entry fobs.

(a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the cl ause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on N orth Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sunday s) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtai ned.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewi s.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5in clearance) will require a time stamped searched- label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched- labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicl e is over 12'-5in in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a -searched- label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any ti er, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protec tion Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gat e lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the S couts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.

Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.- Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  -a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per  week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the  DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access  Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a f ast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is d enied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole  discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the  required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance n otice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their emp loyees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, f ollowed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.

Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990) 
Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government?s best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following:
Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)
The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.

(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.
(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.    (3) For long-term contracts?
(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and
(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the exercise date specified in the contract for any option thereafter.
(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/ .
(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.
(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.
(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.
(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:

VENDORS NOTICE: Reference DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Request.  All vendors are required to submit electronic invoices through the Wide Area Workflow - Receiving and Acceptance website. Contact Dennis Hass at (310) 653-6119, 61st CONS/LGCP for additional information.
 
Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions
Installation and Registration Checklist new WAWF users.

Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the WAWF contractor and user accounts.

1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered.
?	?n?nIf you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. 
?	For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk, 888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil , or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.asp
2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR).
?	All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/ .
?	Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.).
?	Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.
3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC).
?	The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. 
?	To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/  and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS.
?	Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company?s EB POC, you need click on ?Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN? to add it.
?	Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC?s (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination.
?	The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor?s organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor.
?	Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html 
4. Determine if your organization will designate a WAWF Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM).
?	In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM.
?	A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account.
?	The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM?s, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC.
?	The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
?	The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users.
?	The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.
5. Establish an organizational email address
?	All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm?s organizational email account.
?	The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
?	Ensure that your firm?s organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
?	Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.
6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA
?	Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA.
?	Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.
7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site   https://wawf.eb.mil/
?	Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form.
?	Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions.
?	Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering.
?	PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities:  Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com , Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html , or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com.  The web sites provide theinstructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate.
?	If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.
?	Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.
8. Follow-up (if necessary).
?	If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:

<CONTACT>Theresa M. Velasquez Contracting Officer 3032313937     theresa.velasquez.mms.gov;
<DESC>The purpose of this modificaiton is to show the following questions and answers on Solicitation Number M07PC14669. What is the required scanning dpi? 200dpi or 300dpi What building at the Fed Center will the government computer be setup at?  Building 85  Can the scanning take place at a different building from the location of the government computer at the Federal Center?  Yes, but the Government will need to know what documents are being transferred (both ways) and when.  The final output is a PDF image but what are the output requirements for the indexing/metadata?   We are requesting document type, date scanned, and perhaps a batch number or description .  How is the PDF image to be named?   It may depend on the document type and batch.  The decision has not yet been made to the degree of specificity you are requesting.   Can we leave our scanner, PC and software onsite all the time or do we need to remove after each job order?   Yes you may leave the PC and software onsite all the time.  We have a secure building on a secured campus.  However, we may not be able to lock up the PC and software within the building.  I have a few questions regarding the above referenced request for proposals. In particular, what indexing/metadata fields do you anticipate needing, what kind of data will we be providing, and how should the data be delivered?   Answer:  We are requesting document type, date scanned, and perhaps a batch number or description - all of which can easily be entered at the time of scanning, so we do not anticipate a need for sending the data anywhere except for writing to a "thumb" drive or CD-ROM to transfer the scanned PDF files to the MMS system, as per the solicitation.  Should a proposal include sending the data externally either electronically in a physical medium, the transmitted data must be encrypted.

<DESC>***This is a sole source procurement***

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 12, utilizing FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This announcement constitutes the synopsis; proposals are being requested electronically to Mr. Raymond Hawkins, Jr., hawkinsra@mail.nih.gov, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) under NLM-07-230/RSH.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 ? ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT AND GENERAL MANAGEMENT CONSULTING SERVICES.

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure services for the planning and gathering of two meetings: (1) A workshop to identify ?policy resistant public health problems? relevant to the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) mission and prioritize them; and, (2) a two day meeting of leaders in the field to formulate new research questions, directions, perhaps a new grid or paradigms for the next generation of health disparities research all on behalf of the National Institutes of Health.  

Title:  Concept Mapping Projects to Address Policy Resistant Public Health Problems.

1) Policy-Resistant Public Health Problems

This project is to identify areas that are considered or have been observed to be ?policy-resistant? and will be led by Dr. Patricia Mabry at OBSSR.  This is a collaborative effort between OBSSR and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The desired end point of the concept mapping project for this focus shall be the delivery of presentation ready materials by November 2, 2007 for the Expert Panel meeting to be held on November 15 - 16, 2007 in Washington, DC.  A final report of the project shall be delivered following this meeting and in the second week of December, 2007. 

Project Specifics: 

?	Participants for brainstorming, sorting, and rating will be drawn from OBSSR and CDC list serves and the email distribution lists of other professional organizations.  The process of identifying participants has already begun.

?	Respondent questions will depend on the Working Group?s interest in sub-group comparisons, and will be defined prior to sorting and rating.

?	Rating scales will also be determined according to the Working Group?s interest in value comparisons, and will be defined after the brainstorming is underway.  

?	Products will include preliminary results, final results, a full presentation in electronic and hard copy format in advance of the Expert Panel workshop, Expert Panel web or teleconference briefings, and a final summary report of the concept mapping activities and results. 

Planning and Project Management:  Vendor shall be responsible for managing timelines, harmonizing communication approaches with those of OBSSR, and ensuring that OBSSR has the information it needs to make project related decisions.  Although some travel will be required at key points, the project requires a routine schedule of planning conference calls, to begin within a week after the contract is awarded.  This provides a cost-effective and time-sensitive way for the project to proceed in the time required.

Working Group:  The Working Group for this project will include Dr. Mabry and Dr. Milstein, as well as other OBSSR senior staff assigned to this project.  It will also include two of the vendor?s senior staff and one project manager. Vendor will be responsible for the timely and complete fulfillment of each activity in the planned scope of work.    

Responses to the focus prompt will enable the Office to clearly delineate these areas, and identify priorities among them, for strategic, systemic change.  Thus, the focus prompt is critical to ensuring that the feedback from the invited experts will be on target with the Office?s needs.  The focus prompt will be drafted, piloted and finalized as soon as is practicable, in collaboration with the Office and the project Working Group.  

Determining Rating Scales and Respondent Questions:  With vendor guidance, the Working Group will determine the most useful rating scales for the purposes of this project.   They will also develop the respondent questions that they expect would yield the most useful opportunities for comparison of participant subgroups.

Communicating with Meeting Attendees to participate in pre-meeting activities:   Taking into account the Office?s interest in holding the expert workshop on November 15- 16, 2007, the OBSSR project team will have drafts of invitations or ?save the date? communications to send to the invitees in fairly short order if deemed necessary or appropriate.  OBSSR will connect the communication needs of the concept mapping activities to those communications that the OBSSR has planned regarding the late fall meeting, harmonizing messages and timing to ensure that the invitees have sufficient notice and encouragement to participate.  Vendor shall be responsible for participation reminders over the duration of the concept mapping activities themselves.

Designing and Managing Websites for Participation:    Vendor shall be responsible for ensuring that the Working Group is satisfied with the specifics of the project design, including the focus prompt and timeline for participation.  Vendor shall design, host, monitor and manage global websites that will be customized for this project, and will communicate regarding timeframes for participation at each stage.

Conducting Brainstorming:  Vendor will host the customized website for stakeholders to contribute specific responses to the focus prompt.  

Post-Brainstorming Synthesis:  Prior to issuing a request for sorting and rating, vendor shall work with the Working Group to review, edit and render consistent and usable the set of unique ideas that will have emerged from the brainstorming.  

Conducting Sorting and Rating:  Vendor shall host unique sites for these activities.  It is common practice to identify a smaller number of invitees to take part in the sorting activity.  The Working Group will indentify and invite a subset of about 40 - 50 people from the brainstorming group to complete the sorting activities.  All who were invited to brainstorm will also be invited to rate.  

Analysis and Results Development:  Vendor shall conduct all the necessary analyses and develop preliminary results for review and editing by the Working Group.  Vendor shall edit and convey revisions of the preliminary analysis to the Working group for final approval in advance of the expert workshop. 

Final Presentation at the Expert Panel Meeting:  Vendor shall prepare all final concept mapping related materials for distribution at the meeting.  Vendor will support the Office?s development of the Expert Panel meeting agenda, to the degree that the concept mapping results will help to frame a purposeful focus on the areas of interest to the assembled group and to OBSSR.

2) Health Disparities

In this portion of the project, OBSSR is interested in identifying issues or targeted areas of concentration that relate the fact of health disparities to social and behavioral issues.  Dr. Stephane Philogene assisted by other OBSSR staff and contractors will lead this initiative.  The desired end point of the concept mapping project for this focus will be the presentation of results at a meeting on health disparities and social and behavioral sciences.  This meeting will be held in late January 2008.

Project Specifics: 

?	The identification of meeting invitees will clearly guide the development of the participant list for this effort.  We anticipate that participants will number about 100 for brainstorming and rating.  We anticipate between 40 and 50 of these to be invited to sort as well.

?	Respondent questions will depend on the Working Group?s interest in sub-group comparisons, and will be defined prior to sorting and rating.

?	Rating scales will also be determined according to the Working Group?s interest in value comparisons, and will be defined after the brainstorming is underway.  

?	Products will include preliminary results, final results, a full presentation in electronic and hard copy format in advance of the expert workshop, and a final summary report of the concept mapping activities and results. 

Planning and Project Management:  Vendor shall be responsible for managing timelines, harmonizing communication approaches with those of OBSSR, and ensuring that OBSSR has the information it needs to make project related decisions.  Although some travel will be required at key points, the project requires a routine schedule of planning conference calls, to begin within a week after the contract is awarded.  This provides a cost-effective and time-sensitive way for the project to proceed in the time required.

Working Group:  The Working Group for this project will include Dr. Philogene and other OBSSR staff and contractors as designated. It will also include two of the vendor?s senior staff and one project manager.  The Working Group will be responsible for the timely and complete fulfillment of each activity in the planned scope of work.  

Participants in the concept mapping activities:  Participants will include policy experts, academic researchers, government representatives and other officials as identified by OBSSR.  

Target participation for each project phase is as follows:
?	Brainstorming:  up to 200 participants
?	Sorting:  up to 50 participants
?	Rating:  up to 200 participants

Focus prompt:  The objectives of this concept mapping project are to develop a collaborative, knowledge-based framework of the issues of health disparities in relation to behavioral and social science.  Responses to the focus prompt will enable the Office to identify priorities for research support in these areas. The proposed focus prompt is the following:

What breakthrough research is needed to eliminate disparities in health?

Determining Rating Scales and Respondent Questions:  The Working Group will determine the rating foci and scales that would be most useful for the purposes of this project.  They will also consider what respondent questions they expect would yield the most useful opportunities for comparison of subgroups of participants.  

Communicating with Meeting Attendees to participate in pre-meeting activities:   Taking into account the Office?s interest in holding the expert workshop no later than mid-February 2008, the OBSSR project team will likely have drafts of invitations or ?save the date? communications to send to the invitees in fairly short order.  OBSSR will connect the communication needs of the concept mapping activities to those communications that the OBSSR has planned regarding the winter 2008 meeting, harmonizing messages and timing to ensure that the invitees have sufficient notice and encouragement to participate.  In addition, vendor shall be responsible for participation reminders over the duration of the concept mapping activities themselves.

Designing and Managing Websites for Participation:    Vendor is responsible for ensuring that the Working Group is satisfied with the specifics of the project design, including the focus prompt and timeline for participation.  Vendor shall design, host, monitor and manage global websites that will be customized for this project, and will communicate regarding timeframes for participation at each stage.

Conducting Brainstorming:  Vendor shall host the customized website for meeting attendees to contribute specific responses to the focus prompt.  

Post-Brainstorming Synthesis:  Prior to a request for sorting and rating, Vendor shall work with the Working Group to review, edit and render consistent and usable the set of unique ideas that will have emerged from the brainstorming. 

Conducting Sorting and Rating:  Vendor shall host unique sites for these activities.  It is common practice to identify a smaller number of invitees to take part in the sorting activity.  Participants for the sorting activity will be identified by the Working Group from the list of all expert workshop invitees.  All who were invited to brainstorm will also be invited to rate.

Analysis and Results Development:  Vendor will conduct all the necessary analyses and develop preliminary results for review and editing by the Working Group.  Vendor shall edit and convey to the Working group for final approval in advance of the expert workshop. 

Final Presentation at the Expert Workshop:  Vendor shall prepare all concept mapping related materials for distribution at the meeting, and shall conduct the final presentation.  If it is determined necessary by OBSSR, Vendor shall support the Office?s development of the expert meeting/summit agenda, to the degree that the concept mapping results will help to frame a purposeful focus on the areas of interest to the assembled group and to OBSSR.

Travel:  In support of this project, OBSSR anticipates two planning meetings that will take place at the OBSSR offices in Bethesda.  These meetings will coincide with milestones in the project, and will be necessary for the timely completion of each deliverable and decision step.  Vendor may be required to attend the expert meeting/summit in California to present the results of the project and assist as appropriate.  The project officer will decide and approve any required travel.

Title: Native American Listening Circles Project

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure services for the development of a healthy tribal community in part through outreach assistance to a tribal information technology company (in this case, the Ft. Berthold Indian Reservation, home to the MHA Nation?Mandan-Hidatsa-Arikara, also known as Three Affiliated Tribes) that would ultimately result in jobs creation on the reservation on behalf of the National Institutes of Health.  
 
Given the high unemployment rates on Indian reservations, the National Congress of American Indians recognizes job creation as one of the top priorities for addressing the underlying causes of many tribal health issues.

To achieve the primary purpose of tribal economic development, the project includes tasks that address several main components of successful small business development?effective planning and scheduling; strong technical infrastructure (hardware and software); well trained management and staff; proven track record in core business; well tested and accurate pricing models; and reliable reporting and accountability.  The tasks as a whole are intended to improve the competitive capabilities and posture of the vendor and also to refine, test, and strengthen the company?s core scanning and document conversion services (through scanning and converting materials provided by or through NLM).

The overall goal is to expand and strengthen the core business and document conversion capabilities of MHA Systems Inc., and thereby contribute to the long-term economic viability of the company and its ability to provide jobs for tribal members of the MHA Nation.

SCOPE OF WORK:

	The contractor will:

?	TASK 1.  Prepare Detailed Project Plan and Schedule.  
This will include comprehensive consideration of options for use of the project budget for equipment, training, web site, and other investments in MHA Systems Inc. that would be expected to further enhance the competitiveness of the company in the scanning and related document conversion markets, and the general overall corporate competitiveness and thereby the ability of the company to create jobs for tribal members of the MHA Nation.  This also will include a detailed plan, including cost and pricing estimates, for scanning and converting materials to be provided by or through NLM, to be developed in consultation with NLM.   This will include final revised cost and pricing estimates for the AIDS abstract document conversion work itemized in Tasks 6, 7, and 8 in this SOW.  Also, the plan should include a schedule for incremental deliverables for Tasks 6, 7, and 8, with the first increment a pilot deliverable of approximately 100 converted AIDS abstracts.  This will allow an early opportunity for QA problem detection and resolution.  The size of the incremental deliveries should be consistent with a balanced and orderly work flow at MHA Systems Inc. and QA review by the Task Manager and NLM.
 
?	TASK 2.  Purchase Hardware and Software Upgrades for MHA Systems Inc.
This will include the purchase of the additional hardware and software identified in TASK 1 that would optimize the competitive posture of MHA Systems Inc. in carrying out the document conversion work assigned in this contract and in related work.  This equipment will supplement and complement the equipment provided in Phases I, II, and III, and will be prioritized to support the document conversion work specified in Tasks 5, 6, 7, and 8 of this SOW.

?	TASK 3.  Arrange Additional Professional Training for MHA Systems Inc. Staff.  
This will include the arranging of select additional training courses and classes for MHA Systems staff and management, with a general goal of increasing the technical and management skills of staff, so as to further enhance the overall capacity and competitive posture of MHA Systems Inc.  This additional training will supplement and complement the training provided in Phases I, II, and III, and will be prioritized to support the document conversion work specified in Tasks 5, 6, 7, and 8 of this SOW.

?	TASK 4.  Commission MHA Systems Web Site and Related Promotional Upgrades.  
This will include further upgrades to the MHA Systems corporate Web site and related promotional brochures and information pieces.  This may include exhibiting at high impact industry trade shows.

?	TASK 5.  Scanning Pilot Study Phase IV, Part 1.  
This will include the scanning by MHA Systems Inc. of additional materials provided by or through NLM.  The nature, scanning/conversion specifications, and volume of these materials will be determined in consultation with NLM as part of developing the detailed project plan.

?	TASK 6.  AIDS Abstract Document Conversion Part 1.  
This will include the document conversion of the first group of AIDS abstracts, TBD, with exact pricing and schedule TBD (based on Task 1 results).   As with Task 5, the nature, scanning and conversion specifications, and volume of these materials will be determined in consultation with NLM as part of developing the detailed project plan.  The AIDS abstracts will be similar to the samples provided to MHA Systems Inc.  All document conversion will conform to the bibliographic, DTD, and XML standards provided by NLM, including the NLM Library Operations Division, Bibliographic Services Division.  Technical oversight and quality assurance of work product will be conducted by the Task Manager or his/her designee.

NOTE:  For all AIDS Abstract Document Conversion Tasks (including Tasks 6, 7, and 8 in the current SOW), the contractor will carry out the following specific task elements:

1) Analyze print volume / CD-ROM to identify which portions of the AIDS conference/meeting proceedings would be used;
2) In the case of CD-ROM products, printing of each abstract for conversion;
3) Analyze the bibliographic citations and abstract set up. Set up style sheet/instructions for doing the conversion;
4) Conversion of the citations and abstracts to the meeting abstract XML format (scanning / OCR component);
5) QA of conversion to produce XML file that validates against the Meetings Abstract DTD;
6) Delivery of the XML file and return of the original Print or CD-ROM product (original material must be returned in order, though not necessarily in a bound form);
7) Responding to Task Manager and NLM QA evaluation, including NLM Library Operations Division, Bibliographic Services Division, and Medlars Management Section.

These are the overall tasks that the contractor is expected to handle.  The materials to be converted are primarily either in bound paper format or on CD-ROM; there are 4 conferences in PDF format, but they can be handled similarly to the CD-ROM material.  The paper versions must be returned to NLM in order, though not necessarily in bound form.  In most cases, we only have one copy of the conference proceedings and must have the original to use for our QA process.  For the CD-ROM volumes, the CD must be returned.  We also assume that the vendor is most likely going to need to print out the abstracts and then do the scanning/OCR work.

?	TASK 7.   AIDS Abstract Document Conversion Part 2.   
This will include the document conversion of the second group of AIDS abstracts, TBD, with exact pricing and schedule TBD (based on Task 1 results).   As with Task 5, the nature, scanning and conversion specifications, and volume of these materials will be determined in consultation with NLM as part of developing the detailed project plan.  The AIDS abstracts will be similar to the samples provided to MHA Systems Inc.  All document conversion will conform to the bibliographic, DTD, and XML standards provided by NLM, including the NLM Library Operations Division, Bibliographic Services Division.  Technical oversight and quality assurance of work product will be conducted by the Task Manager or his/her designee.

?	TASK 8.   AIDS Abstract Document Conversion Part 3.   
This will include the document conversion of the third group of AIDS abstracts, TBD, with exact pricing and schedule TBD (based on Task 1 results).   As with Task 5, the nature, scanning and conversion specifications, and volume of these materials will be determined in consultation with NLM as part of developing the detailed project plan.  The AIDS abstracts will be similar to the samples provided to MHA Systems Inc.  All document conversion will conform to the bibliographic, DTD, and XML standards provided by NLM, including the NLM Library Operations Division, Bibliographic Services Division.  Technical oversight and quality assurance of work product will be conducted by the Task Manager or his/her designee.

Over the next year the Office of Extramural Affairs, NIDA, is scheduled to face an expanded workload of RFAs, other special reviews, in addition to managing reviews in standing review committees.  It will not be possible for the current levels of staffing to carry out these tasks. As future year workloads cannot be determined at this time, it is not possible to determine the need to continue this contract in subsequent years.

OEA staff will serve as the DFO/SRA for this work, conducting review meetings and preparing final summary statements.  Contract staff will assist with the preliminary work for review meetings, including developing pools of potential reviewers, participating in meetings with OEA staff to establish logistics of review meetings, and will help prepare draft summary statements.  Contract staff will also participate in any other necessary meetings (e.g., with program staff) that are necessary to support designated tasks.

Following review meetings, contract staff will be given compiled sets of reviewers' raw critiques and a copy of any available OEA staff handwritten notes from the discussion of each application.  Using these materials, the contract staff person will prepare recommendations for possible modifications to reviewer critiques and suggested text for a Resume and Summary of reviewers' critiques and discussion, as well as text for brief paragraphs that may be required for summary statement sections on animal/human subjects and minority/gender/children inclusion.  These sections should explain concerns or comments expressed in reviewers' critiques and discussions at meetings.  The contract staff will also read and edit reviewers? critiques for grammatical, typographical, and other errors that interfere with clarity and communication.  OEA staff will review the drafts and OEA staff will finalize the summary statements after the contract staff has completed their work.  OEA staff will conduct all functions that are inherently governmental functions.

Privacy Act Requirements:  The contractor will not disclose any information contained in the grant applications or reviews or discussions at review committee meetings to anyone not directly connected with the grant review process and must protect the contents of the applications.
