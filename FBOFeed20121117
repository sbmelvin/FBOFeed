(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011. <br>  <br> PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as  quote mark Sensitive but Unclassified quote mark  or  quote mark For Official Use Only quote mark . <br>  <br> BACKGROUND: <br> The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification. <br>  <br> INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT: <br> 1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range. <br>      a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics. <br>      b. Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen. <br>      c. Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired. <br>      d. High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS). <br>      e. High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading. <br>      f. All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard. <br>      g. Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons. <br>      h. Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons. <br>  <br> 2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes. <br>  <br> 3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons. <br>  <br> 4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training. <br>  <br> 5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battle space 2 (VBS 2) into the system. <br>  <br> HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY: <br> Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.
