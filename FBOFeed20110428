<DESC>Forensic Accounting Services - This solicitation will be an Firm fixed price IDIQ with a 6 month base option with two - 6 month options. This solicitation will be restricted to certified 8A companies. The solicitation will be released on or around 12 May 2011.<br>This procurement requires that the contractor provide forensic accounting capabilities.  Forensic capabilities for this effort includes, but is not limited to, the integration of investigation skills, research, law, quantitative methods, finance,  accounting, anti-money laundering, and law enforcement officer insights required to trace the money and provide forensic accounting recommendations and support to the other experts of TF as appropriate.  The investigation skills and law enforcement officer insights are twofold.  First, the contractor shall assist in structuring, building and populating the forensic accounting effort through case files/databases, the linkages, and the methods, techniques and intuitions on what to look for/how to identify possible anomalies.  This information will assist government officials in providing recommendations based on the facts that will feed the legal, criminal and intelligence groups.  Second, the contractor is required to have the skill sets to understand and anticipate all types of information and facts as well as the structuring of the information, the need for completeness, accuracy and reporting that the legal, criminal investigators and law enforcement groups associated with this effort will require.  The Contractor shall comply with all U.S. and Host Nation laws, regulations, policies, procedures, and guidelines in the performance of this requirement, and shall continuously meet US Military Service Standards unless otherwise stated.  <br><br>The contractor will focus on select prime contracts in Regional Command South and will attempt to gain as much information as possible about the sub-contracting networks of those select prime contracts.  The contractor will be expected to take existing prime contractor information, Government provided investigation information, and Government provided intelligence information and enters it into a database.   The contractor will use the databases to capture and analyze each prime contract (including the subcontracting networks and flow of funds from the prime contractor through all tiers of subcontractors), develop contract profiles, company profiles including aliases, related parties and beneficiaries, individual profiles including aliases, related parties and beneficiaries and the linkages between these profiles.  These will be used to also develop decomposition maps and also to identify linkages to the subcontracting networks, aliases and related parties as well as the association of the flow of funds from the prime contractor through all tiers of subcontractors, related parties and direct and indirect recipients of benefits.  This data linkage development and data mining is proactive and reactive - driven by the inputs, inquires and direction from the legal, criminal investigation, contracting, intelligence and overseeing customer. <br><br>Simultaneously, the contractor will review Prime Contracts, engage with the Intelligence cell shall be conducted to understand the collected information related to designated parties including the capture of alter egos, alias, related relationships that can factor into the forensic driven relationship mappings.<br>The Contractor shall develop the factual support for the identification of the money movement and the recipients of funds.  This shall include an understanding of the monetary system, a visual of the 'real life' flow as well as the names and connections of all people, business entities and government officials that receive the funds and/or some direct benefit.  This shall include primes, subcontractors, undisclosed affiliates and any parties along the way that touched the funds or influenced the flow.<br>The contractor will track money movement and shall include a review of the financial records, in country and foreign bank accounts, subject to approval from the appropriate country, as well as conducting voluntary interviews.  The contractor shall prepare an interview guide with topics of discussion prior to any interview.  This guide shall be approved by the appropriate government official prior to any interviews.  All statements and information provided by individuals shall be validated <br>The financial transactions can be linked by different methods, since cash is fungible.  Often times the timing of transactions and deposits, or cargo movement is the initial step in tracing the funds.  The written report will include a chronology of key events, people and modus operandi, which will be linked to the financial transactions. Through this review of the money movement and underlining understanding of the monetary system, factual conclusions, briefings and reports with substantiation and recommendations will be provided to the appropriate government officials as to how contract monies were disbursed, and ultimately the direct and indirect beneficiaries.<br>

The VISN 10 Contracting Activity intends to award a sole source contract with a Vendor to purchase two hundred (200)  nurse locating badges which utilize an infrared signal to notify the whereabouts of a particular nurse.   The procurement will be for the VAMC Cleveland, Ohio. The Government believes that Hill-Rom is the only company that can satisfy the agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to proceed with sole source procurement for the required equipment. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 - Other Than Full and Open Competition justification and approval. To the best of our knowledge, Hill-Rom Co is the only source that provides the above indicated system. Any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within three (3) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Telephone and facsimile requests/inquiries will not be accepted. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements. Information can be sent to Contracting Officer: franklin.difranco@va.gov.  Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the Cleveland VA Medical Center will precede with the sole source award with a Vendor who can provide a quote for the two hundred nurse locating badges mentioned above.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to conduct negotiations on a sole source basis with the Johns Hopkins University, 615 N Wolfe Street, Room E-6618 Baltimore, Maryland. The objective of the contract is to provide a final technical report describing results from a collaborative field study to improve understanding of the relative contributions of direct-contact, respiratory droplets, and droplet nuclei for transmission of influenza in healthcare settings. To accomplish this, NIOSH proposes conducting both laboratory and field studies. The specific objectives of this contract are as follows: 1) measure the airborne and surface concentration of influenza in outpatient settings (including ER departments and Emergency Acute Care units) during the flu season, 2) assess the level of virus contamination on personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by healthcare workers (HCW) in outpatient settings such as gloves, i.e. surgical masks (SMs), and filtering face piece respirators (FFRs), 3) determine the potential for contact transmission of influenza from the donning and doffing of contaminated FFRs and SMs under simulated in use conditions For this contract, NIOSH intends to expand upon that CDC funded ResPECT study to include additional studies to address questions related to influenza transmission. The clinical study began pilot testing on January 26, 2011 at 4 outpatient locations ("clusters") in the Baltimore, Maryland area, led by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Responsible sources that believe they posses the expertise and capabilities identified above should submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose. Please forward capabilities and supporting information to: Mary Pat Shanahan, CDC, NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh PA 15236, mpu0@cdc.gov. If no affirmative responses are received then negotiations will be conducted with the Johns Hopkins University.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources with thecapabilities to provide performance based services type support to NASA Goddard SpaceFlight Centers Ocean Ecology Branch (OEB), including support for current and futureflight projects, oceanographic laboratory and field programs, satellite and fieldinstrument development, and biological and physical oceanographic research projects. These efforts will be led by NASA research staff, but with substantial reliance onon-site contractor support in all phases of research, development, implementation, andoperations.  A primary focus of the OEB is to produce, distribute, and validate global time-series ofbiological and physical oceanographic measurements derived from spaceborne remote sensingradiometric observations.  These data products are made available to the internationalresearch community for climate change, global carbon cycle, and ocean ecosystem research. The work is performed within the auspices of the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG),which is responsible for ocean color and sea surface temperature data production from theModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) currently operating on the Terraand Aqua spacecraft, as well as the production of ocean color products from legacymissions such as the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and the Coastal ZoneColor Scanner (CZCS).  The responder must be able to perform satellite instrumentcalibration analyses (preflight and on-orbit), vicarious calibration and validation tofield measurements, software and algorithm development for the processing of observedradiances to biogeophysical products, and development and operation of the processingsystem software and hardware to manage multiple data streams and massive (petabyte) datavolumes.  The contractor will provide support for satellite data product distributionthrough the OceanColorWeb (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov  ), which requires developmentand maintenance of data browse and ordering systems and the management and enhancement ofhigh-speed networks and data servers.  Additionally, the contractor will provide support for the Visible and InfraredImager/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) that will soon be launched as part of the NationalPolar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Preparatory Project(NPP).	This task covers all activities required for the evaluation of the VIIRS/NPPocean Environmental Data Records (EDRs), with emphasis on the radiance, chlorophyll, andsea surface temperature products.  The responder must demonstrate expertise in theend-to-end scientific requirements for satellite-based remote sensing of ocean color fromthe VIIRS instrument, including its unique sensor design, the instruments prelaunchcharacterization and methods developed for the post-launch calibration, algorithmrefinement and evaluation, and data product validation.  The contractor will also provide support for NASAs collaboration with the space agencyof Argentina on the Aquarius mission for the collection of global sea surface salinitymeasurements.  After launch, project management of the Aquarius mission will transfer tothe OBPG.  The contractor will develop the Aquarius Data Processing System (ADPS) foracquisition and processing of raw sensor data into derived salinity values mapped tostandard global products, and for the archiving and distribution of these products.  Inaddition, the contractor will develop, test, implement and operate the AquariusInstrument Command and Control System (ACCS) for operations scheduling, instrumentcommanding and anomaly resolution.  There will be extensive mission readiness reviews,simulations and rehearsals and launch and early orbit coordination of the Aquarius/SAC-Dspacecraft, which requires interaction and coordinated planning between the AquariusGround System at NASA GSFC and the NASA Ground Network.  The responder must demonstratethat they have the combined training and experience to provide continuation of missioncritical support, including the instrument planning and commanding, telemetry andperformance monitoring, and science data processing, and instrument testing activities.In addition, the contractor will provide support and expertise for new missions andadvance sensor development.   This includes the development of a prototype hyperspectralremote sensing ocean color sensor that is currently underway within the OEB. Thecontractor will provide guidance for the testing of the prototype at GSFC and at theNational Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg.  Furthermore, thecontractor will provide support for mission design and instrument characterization for anocean color radiometer to be selected and flown on the recently defined Pre AtmosphereClouds and Ecosystems (PACE) mission, and  assist in establishment of missionrequirements for the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) mission.The responder must be capable of assessing the spectral, spatial, and temporalrequirements necessary to capture the variability of ocean biogeochemical processes,evaluating instrument design concepts, developing instrument test procedures, evaluatinginstrument calibration and characterization data, developing ocean color algorithms toexploit new sensor capabilities, and implementing such algorithms into an operationalprocessing scheme.  In support of the satellite ocean color calibration, validation, and algorithmdevelopment efforts, the OEB also requires contractor support for participation inoceanographic field data collection campaigns, laboratory analysis of field measurements,and management of a database of in situ bio-optical and environmental observations(SeaBASS).  Specifically, the contractor will support activities associated with thePhytoplankton Pigment Analysis Laboratory (PPAL) and the Field Program Support Office(FPSO) within the Ocean Ecology Branch.  The PPAL uses a High Performance LiquidChromatography (HPLC) system to process field samples collected by investigatorssupported by the NASA Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program.  Currently, the PPALanalyzes approximately 3000 samples per year providing the concentrations of key pigmentsto the investigators.  These results are also incorporated into SeaBASS.  The FPSOparticipates in at least one major ocean cruise per year and collects optical data(apparent optical and inherent optical properties) and water samples for post-cruiseanalyses.  All data collection and analyses (chemical and optical data) follow NASAprotocols.  Water sample analyses for parameters like colored dissolved organic matter,suspended particulate matter, and particulate organic matter are conducted within theGSFC laboratory facilities.  The PPAL and FPSO contract staff will participate in thefield data collection, maintain and operate the optical instrumentation and laboratoryequipment, and make recommendations on upgrades and additional instrumentation requiredfor the laboratory and field work.  The responder is also expected to participate in field instrument development and must becapable of contributing to the conception, design, prototyping, and field commissioningof both fixed wavelength and hyperspectral optical sensors for above- and in-watersystems. Above-water instruments will be used for oceanic, atmospheric, and terrestrialapplications, so competencies in all three disciplines is necessary. In addition,expertise in data acquisition, processing, and synthesis for above- and in-waterinstrument types is required. The ability to establish and maintain quality assurance andquality control procedures, as well as to mitigate risk by creating and executing aquality assurance plan must be demonstrated. Documentation will be produced for allphases of instrument development and the respondent is expected to contribute not only todrafting the documentation, but also to finalizing and facilitating the publication anddistribution of the documentation. Finally, the contractor will support ongoing research directed at understanding marinebiogeochemistry and ecosystem dynamics and temporal variability on regional and globalscales.  The research emphasizes the marine carbon cycle and the interactions andfeedbacks between biological (e.g., primary production), chemical (e.g., organic carbonand nutrient balances and fluxes), and physical processes (river discharge, mixed layerdynamics, circulation, etc.).  This research is conducted in support of the NASA OceanBiology and Biogeochemistry Program (http://science.hq.nasa.gov/oceans/  ) and is alsodesigned to contribute to the U.S. Climate Change Research Program.   To support theseresearch activities, the responder must demonstrate experience in field sample collectionon oceanographic vessels, laboratory measurements (chemical and optical), and satellitedata analysis. In all activities described above, the responder is expected to participate in thedrafting, editing, and final production of scientific documentation, e.g., technicalreports, journal articles, presentation, and posters, using NASA publication style andstandards. The work also involves word processing, as well as graphical layout anddesign. Knowledge of NASA Scientific and Technical Information (STI) publicationrequirements and procedures is required, as well as NASA Center for Aerospace Information(CASI) archiving procedures. The responder must be able to work effectively with theTechnical Information & management Services (TiMS) office to effect the printing ofdocumentation, as well as the Goddard mail center for any subsequent distribution of thepublished content.Based on past experience with existing contractor-support within the OEB, it is expectedthat the full range of activities described above will require 30-40 contractors with awide range of skill mix, including oceanographers and marine biologists, radiativetransfer specialists, optical engineers and calibration specialists, remote sensingscientists, software engineers and programmers, scientific programmer/analysts, datasystem developers and database managers, and information technologists.

<p><br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is developing its requirements for full service clipping and media monitoring support services. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information to assist ICE in formulating its requirements, and identify qualified vendors that are able to meet ICE's requirements.</p>
<p>ICE is open to alternative ideas. Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternatives that can help ICE better define its requirements and obtain a contract management solution that meets its needs.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS ISSUED SOLELY FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 15.202(E), THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PRESENTLY INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT, BUT WANTS TO OBTAIN PRICE, DELIVERY, AND OTHER MARKET RESEARCH FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT. RESPONDENTS ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO THIS RFI.</p>
<p>RESPONSES TO THIS RFI WILL NOT BE RETURNED. RESPONDENTS WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULT OF THE REVIEW.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>ICE is the principal investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the second largest investigative agency in the federal government. Created in 2003 through a merger of the investigative and interior enforcement elements of the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, ICE has more than 20,000 employees in offices in all 50 states and 47 foreign countries.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Public Affairs (OPA) is responsible for the effective dissemination of accurate information to the public concerning ICE programs and its mission. OPA provides primary support to the Assistant Secretary of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with lead responsibility for the communication of agency goals, objectives and accomplishments. In addition, OPA is responsible for the preparation and distribution of information to state and local officials, agency stakeholders, and the general public.</p>
<p>Due to the high profile nature of the ICE mission, ICE related stories remain prominently featured by media outlets. Senior ICE officials and program managers must be kept abreast of news coverage relating directly or indirectly to the mission and operations of ICE as it relates to major important news, legislative activity and operations involving the agency. ICE leadership must remain current of issues and trends that could impact ICE in the future as well as issues raised in current media stories being reported on a daily basis. To meet this need, OPA requires services for clipping and media monitoring support.</p>
<p><br />SCOPE</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement intends to outsource the daily creation of a morning news briefing and media monitoring support. In support of ICE's mission, agency officials must start each day fully informed about important news printed and broadcast nationwide. ICE has determined that this will be best accomplished via preparation of an expert-edited daily briefing that weaves together the important elements of news stories printed and broadcast nationwide rather than full- text articles or computer generated summaries. The items included are culled from thousands of outlets daily and will be based on topics, events, and ICE programs that ICE officials have identified as important. Stories from Radio/Television news that are broadcasted nationally and locally, and that impact ICE and ICE programs must be included.</p>
<p><br />SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>Provide a Daily Media- Monitoring and Analysis Service that delivers exceptional quality and value to the agency and, at minimum must include:</p>
<p>1. Daily Media-Monitoring</p>
<p>The vendor must include the production of the daily clips and news briefing. The vendor must find and review articles and broadcasts from all major daily newspapers, national and local television, newsweeklies, magazines, journals, and internet sites. ICE's primary mission is to promote homeland security and public safety through the criminal and civil enforcement of federal laws governing border control, customs, trade, and immigration. The agency has an annual budget of more than $5.7 billion, primarily devoted to its two principal operating components - Homeland Security Investigations (HIS) and Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO). The third ICE directorate is Management and Administration (M&amp;A). HSI investigates immigration crime, human rights violations and human smuggling, smuggling of narcotics, weapons and other types of contrabands, financial crimes, cybercrime and export enforcement issues. ICE special agents conduct investigations aimed at protecting critical infrastructure industries that are vulnerable to sabotage, attack or exploitation. ERO enforces the nation's immigration laws in a fair and effective manner. Agents and officers identify and apprehend removable aliens, detain individuals when necessary, and remove illegal aliens from the U.S. This directorate prioritizes the apprehension, arrest and removal of convicted criminals, those who pose a threat to national security, fugitives and recent border entrants. Daily production of the daily clips and news-briefing summary must include editing of all information that is redundant and/or irrelevant.</p>
<p>At a minimum the vendor must include a "Top News" section that is provided in the briefing suitable to the needs of ICE officials who must be kept aware of important developments affecting the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcements (ICE) so they may better interact with their peers within the department and partners in other Federal Agencies.</p>
<p>&#61553; Provide a top-level view of the day's news specific to ICE's interests, designed to inform staff about key print and broadcast news in local, regional and national media markets. Each article or video broadcast will be summarized in such a way to allow for a full understanding of the content.</p>

<DESC>The Engineering Branch (N72) of the Military Sealift Command (MSC) requires technical support in conducting a Business Case Analysis to determine present value of maintaining oil lubricated strut and stern tube bearings on the T-AKR 310 class vessels versus replacing strut and stern tube bearings with water lubricated. MSC's objective is to fully investigate all aspects relating to possible bearing replacement including environmental concerns, survivability, maintenance, inspection requirements, shipboard modifications, and life span.
<p>The Contractor shall perform a Business Case Analysis (BCA) comparing water to oil lubricated bearings with a primary focus on reducing life-cycle cost. The BCA will include an investigation into a minimum of four different types of water lubricated bearings to determine the optimum type for the T-AKR 310 WATSON Class. The Contractor is expected to analyze existing costs (baseline) associated with oil lubricated bearings and comparatively analyze projected costs of the four selected replacement bearing types.</p>
<p>All costs will not be known and the Contractor shall use its expertise in order to create estimates and assumptions. Where possible, the Contractor shall describe how such estimates and assumptions were determined. The Contractor shall provide supporting data to the Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) for verification.</p>
<p>A life cycle cost simulation shall be performed taking all identified factors into consideration to determine which variables most significantly impact life cycle costs.</p>

<DESC>The Engineering Branch (N72) of the Military Sealift Command (MSC) Technical Division requires technical support for surveying and evaluating the solid waste (trash) and waste oil collection, treatment, and disposal systems and procedures aboard the WATSON Class vessels. Recommendations for improving waste management will then be developed. The WATSON Class vessels are 72,718 gross tonnage, 958 ft, Large, Medium-Speed Roll-on/Roll-off (LMSR) ships built at NASSCO in San Diego, CA between 1997 and 2002. Waste treatment and disposal is becoming more and more costly and requires the ships to offload waste in port facilities reducing the duration the ships can spend at sea and reducing mission readiness. Current processes are laborious, reducing the time the ship's crew can spend on maintenance and operations.
<p>This task provides for professional engineering services to conduct a waste management study on solid waste (trash) and waste oil collection, treatment and disposal aboard the WATSON Class vessels. The study will review existing ship systems and operational procedures to determine inefficiencies, and original design and equipment shortfalls. The study will also identify both shipping and waste management industry best practices, new processes, and technologies. The study must also provide a minimum of three sustainable waste management system design approaches and salient characteristics to mitigate existing inefficiencies and to reduce dependency on port facilities. A comprehensive cost estimate and business case analysis shall be provided with each of the three system design approaches recommended. Design calculations and additional information shall be provided to demonstrate approach feasibility.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Technical Manufacturing Corporation (TMC), of Peabody, MA, for the acquisition of a STACIS 2100 System and additional hardware, to be used by the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.
<p>The NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) supports the U.S. nanotechnology enterprise from discovery to production by providing industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies with access to world-class nanoscale measurement and fabrication methods and technology. The CNST is the only national nanocenter with a focus on commerce.</p>
<p>The CNST's shared-use NanoFab gives researchers economical access to and training on a state-of-the-art tool set required for cutting-edge nanotechnology development. Looking beyond the current state of the art, CNST research is creating the next generation of nanoscale measurement instruments and methods, which are made available through collaboration.</p>
<p>NIST's CNST Nanofab currently owns a TMC Model 83-Series Acoustic Enclosure with supporting hardware, to be integrated and utilized with an existing Zeiss Ultra 60 FE SEM. NIST has invested over $124,000.00 into the existing equipment; therefore, it is beneficial to the Government to obtain the STACIS 2100 to be integrated with the existing equipment. The TMC Model 83-Series Acoustic Enclosure with supporting hardware provides the CNST Nanofab with the technology to eliminate environmental conditions detrimental to the performance of the Zeiss Ultra 60 FE SEM, however, the STACIS 2100 System and additional hardware is required to be purchased from Technical Manufacturing Corporation, as the technology of the existing Model 83-Series Acoustic Enclosure is proprietary to Technical Manufacturing Corporation and only TMC equipment will provide the proper operation and integration of existing equipment. The existing TMC Model 83-Series Acoustic Enclosure will not operate at the level required to eliminate the environmental conditions of the existing Zeiss Ultra 60 FE SEM without the STACIS 2100 System and additional hardware, which will interfere with the mission of the CNST Division.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by Wednesday May 16, 2011 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) conducts and supports basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. NIAID's Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Duke University (Durham, NC) pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) - which states only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The requirement is to complete the clinical trial entitled, Scleroderma Cyclophosphamide or Transplantation (SCOT).<br /><br />This contract would be a follow-on to the existing contract (#N01-AI-05419) in which Duke University is the incumbent contractor. The anticipated period of performance for the new contract is from June 1, 2011 through October 31, 2017. The anticipated contract will consist of a base period of&nbsp;five months and six 12-month option periods.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span></strong>A trial entitled "A Randomized, Open-Label, Phase II Multi-Center Study of High Dose Immunosuppressive Therapy Using Total Body Irradiation, Cyclophosphamide, ATGAM, and Autologous Transplantation with Auto-CD34+HPC versus Intravenous Pulse Cyclophosphamide for the Treatment of Severe Systemic Sclerosis" otherwise known as the SCOT (Scleroderma: Cyclophosphamide or Transplantation) trial was developed under the leadership of Dr. Sullivan at Duke University in response to a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Prior to the opening of the trial in 2005, a Drug Master File along with Standard Operating Procedures for the production of the cellular product, Auto-CD34+HPC were written and submitted to the FDA. These documents were created in order to ensure consistency in manufacturing across clinical sites. Transplant centers were inspected and qualified for participation in the trial. Version 1.0 of the clinical protocol was submitted to the FDA in August 2004; the first site (Duke) was opened for enrollment in May 2005. Originally 8 transplant centers and 23 rheumatology centers were qualified for participation in the clinical trial although at the current time 8 transplant centers and 11 rheumatology centers remain active.<br /><br />Because of slow enrollment and new data regarding the treatments used in SCOT, the SCOT trial was redesigned in the fall of 2009. Results from recent updates to two previously completed studies were used to estimate the magnitude of the difference of the anticipated differences in survival and event free survival between the two treatment arms of SCOT. This analysis demonstrated that the trial as initially designed was underpowered to detect a difference between the arms at 44 months. The new data revealed that group differences on the order of 20 percentage points could not be anticipated until 54 months following randomization. In order to accommodate both the slow rate of enrollment and the new information on effect size, a hierarchical composite endpoint was developed. The study was amended to include the new endpoint at 54 months with a reduced sample size of 113 subjects. <br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives<br /></span></strong>The SCOT trial was originally designed as a phase III trial to determine whether event free survival would be greater in subjects with severe systemic sclerosis receiving high dose immunosuppressive therapy (HDIT) followed by Auto-CD34+HPC transplantation than in subjects who received a 12 month course of pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide at 44 months after randomization.</p>
<p>Despite the barriers, the study has randomized 69 subjects to date. The purpose of this contract is to provide funds to complete the clinical study. Enrollment will be closed May 31, 2011. Subject follow up will be completed 54 months following the randomization of the last subject. The last date possible for randomization will be October 1, 2011</p>
<p>A non randomized patient registry has been developed and is currently enrolling subjects. The collection of data from subjects eligible for participation in SCOT but who have declined to do so and are undergoing standard of care, will inform the rheumatology community about the progression of systemic sclerosis (SSc) in the current treatment climate. The registry will help to assess whether the outcomes for subjects enrolled in SCOT differ from those seen in individuals treated in the community.</p>
<p>Other tasks to be completed include: flow cytometry studies, high resolution computer assisted tomography studies, and mechanistic studies evaluating the underlying immunologic basis of scleroderma, the effect of treatment on disease status and collection and management of a specimen repository.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br /><br />Project Requirements<br /></strong></span>The consortium of clinical sites developed by the contractor to perform this trial has been maintained and currently consists of 8 transplant centers across the US and Canada. In addition to the transplant centers, 11 rheumatology centers across the US and Canada work to treat and follow subjects from a wider geographic area. Clinical follow up for subjects participating in SCOT needs to be completed. All facets of support for sites will be maintained including support for ongoing IRB approval, protocol development as needed, and maintenance of stem cell lab standards.</p>
<p>Follow up will continue for 54 months following the randomization of the last subject. This time period is essential in order to demonstrate efficacy given the sample size and statistical assumptions. Subjects will be seen on the schedule delineated in the clinical protocol. Data will be submitted to the Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center and publications on the outcome of the trial need to be written.</p>
<p>Follow up will be completed for the non-randomized patient registry to inform the rheumatology community about the progression of SSc in the current treatment climate.</p>
<p>Long term follow up of mortality and morbidity of subjects originally enrolled in the Scleroderma Lung Study will be obtained in order to understand the long term effectiveness of cyclophosphamide in the treatment of scleroderma lung disease.</p>
<p>A repository has been established and is collecting serum, plasma, RNA, DNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells for future use. The contractor will continue to manage the storage and use of the specimens in the repository.</p>
<p>Ongoing mechanistic studies including pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide relative to clinical outcome in both arms of SCOT, immunophenotying by flow cytometry, pulmonary response as measured by high resolution compute assisted tomography, molecular analysis of T cell recovery, and the role of endothelial progenitor cells in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis will continue.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><br />Other Considerations<br /></span></strong>It is critical that the SCOT trial be completed. The subjects have enrolled with the understanding that they will contribute to the medical advances in the field of scleroderma research. To discontinue the trial after enrollment has been closed but before data can be collected to evaluate the primary endpoint is contrary to the basic principles governing clinical research. This cohort of subjects is unique as is the trial design. The samples collected during the trial are also a unique resource. Studying the specimens in concert with complete clinical data may permit further understanding of the immunologic defect in scleroderma.</p>
<p>&bull; The contractor has assembled a unique consortium of sites and investigators to perform the trial. The cooperative clinical structure involving the rheumatology centers and transplant centers was created by Duke to ease the travel burden and provide optimal care for subjects during the period covered by the trial. <br /><br />&bull; Complex contracts based on per patient milestones were developed and implemented by Duke to each of the sites participating in the SCOT trial. Staff is currently employed at Duke to work exclusively on these contracting processes. <br /><br />&bull; Duke has developed a website, advertising, and educational materials to aid in the conduct of the trial. All of these materials require IRB review before they can be made public. Duke's IRB has performed this service. These materials would need to be re-reviewed by another institution's IRB potentially causing delays.<br /><br />&bull; It is ethically imperative that the work of caring for subjects enrolled in a clinical trial not be interrupted.<br /><br />&bull; It is not in the government's interest to transfer the infrastructure Duke has developed to another institution. Operationally, the most efficient course is for Duke to continue to hold the prime contract and manage the structure they have created to complete the SCOT trial. To transfer the administrative responsibilities and all of the contracts would run the risk of an interruption to clinical care and data collection and of compromise to the integrity of the project.</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-10-C-0003 to Rolls-Royce Corporation (RRC), Indianapolis, IN for Engine Surge Margin Testing on the V-22 AE1107C engine. The need for this testing arose due to the austere environment operation requirement leading to a significant number of low power engine removals which have had a negative impact on fleet readiness and life cycle cost of the V-22. A new prototype V-22 Inlet/Scroll modification design change, developed by Bell-Boeing and Rolls Royce, is expected to provide a 30% Time-On-Wing (TOW) improvement, but as a part of the design change validation effort, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) AIR-4.4.7.1 Performance Engineering has required the low power AE1107C engine surge margin testing to ensure the proper power levels can be reached with the new modification.</p>
<p>This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements Rolls-Royce is the only contractor with the engineering data and technical skills to properly test the newly developed Inlet/Scroll modification to ensure that the engines will meet the proper performance perameters.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price purchase order to Northrop Grumman-Sperry Marine Corporation Maritime Systems (Northrop), 1070 Seminole Trail, Charlottesville, VA 22901 for eight (8) radar scan converter cards, P/N: 4801034. This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Northrop is the designer and original equipment manufacturer of these cards. The Radar Scan Converter Card is directly coupled with the Radar Electronics Unit (EU) and Turning Unit (TU) used in the LCAC.  Both the EU and the TU are supplied solely by Northrop. Replacing P/N 4801034 by using a different vendor will be cost prohibitive since it will require extensive modifications to the LCACâ€™s navigation system.
 Northrop is the cataloged Source of Supply in the Navy Supply System for these items. Currently, Northrop is the only vendor for these specific part numbered items, that meets form, fit and function requirements. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. 

The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.


In accordance with FAR 13, a Firm Fixed Price type Contract is anticipated.
 The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334511 and the size standard is 750 employees.

The basis of award will be cost/price being determined to be fair and reasonable.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>GENERAL INFO:<br />The United States Government seeks to lease approximately 7,000 rentable square feet (RSF) to yield approximately 6,072 ANSI / BOMA square feet of contiguous office space in Dallas, TX for the US Probation Office (administrative staff). The space shall be located in a prime commercial office district with attractive, professional surroundings or in an office, research, technology, or business park with a campus-like atmosphere; or an attractively landscaped site containing one or more modern office buildings that are professional in appearance. All services, supplies, utilities, and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration. The offered space must meet Government requirements for security, fire safety and handicapped accessibility. Occupancy is desired for September 2012.<br /><br />LEASE TERM:<br />Term is for 10 years, 5 years firm.<br /><br />AREA OF CONSIDERATION:<br /><strong>North</strong> - I-635<br /><strong>South</strong> - I-35E to McKinnon St to N Pearl St to Woodall Rogers Fwy to Ross Ave to Haskell Ave to Gaston to N Fitzhugh to I-30/Hwy 67 to Route 78<br /><strong>East</strong> - I-30/Hwy 67 to Route 78 to Route 12 to E Lake Highlands Dr to Plano Rd to I-635<br /><strong>West</strong> - I-35 E / Hwy 77<br /><br />ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:<br />Offered location cannot be within 1000 ft and not immediately adjacent to or within same block as schools, day-care centers, preschools, adult entertainment,&nbsp;readily identifiable gang activity, heightened drug-related activity.<br /><br />OTHER INFO:<br />All expressions of interest submitted by brokers/agents must be received by May&nbsp;6, 2011. Expressions of interest should include the following:<br />1) Building name and address<br />2) Rentable square feet and rentable rate per square foot<br />3) One-eighth inch scale drawing of existing space offered - including method of measurement used to determinerentable square feet<br />4) Common Area Factor(s) for available space by floor, if applicable<br />5) Offers must be submitted by owner(s) or by authorized representatives of the owner(s) only.<br /><br />NOTE:<br />The location will house US Probation Office. The office will be staffed with approximately 25 full time court employees. This is a professional office environment and all staff are required to dress in business or professional casual attire.<br /><br />The mission of the office is to provide effective supervision of individuals placed on court-ordered supervision at the pretrial or post-conviction stage in the federal court process. Most supervision activities are performed outside the office, limiting the number of clients who actually report to their officer in the office environment. Most visits with clients take place in their homes, places of<br />employment, or other locations in the community. The office setting is primarily for the officers to conduct business, plan supervision activities, attend meetings, and participate in training events. While the office will oversee the supervision of approximately 900 individuals, only a small portion of that total will report to the office on a regular basis, and it is common for no more than three to five people to be visiting the office at any one time - often less.<br /><br />Interested parties may visit any of our current Dallas/Fort Worth area supervision offices in Garland, Dallas, Benbrook and Arlington. Please call Greg Brown, Administrative Manager, at 214-753-2515 for information.</p>

<DESC>US National Data Center (US NDC) Request for Information<br />This request is an announcement for information for planning purposes only. This Request for Information does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Request for Quote, or Invitation for Bid. Nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government's acquisition approach. <br />The Air Force Technical Application Center (AFTAC) is seeking interested sources for the US National Data Center (US NDC) program, Modernization Contract. The US NDC is the geophysical data acquisition, data processing, reporting and archiving component of the United States Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS) operated by the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC). AFTAC's mission is to monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties to standards set by US verification and policy leaders. This mission requires the US NDC to detect, locate and identify foreign nuclear tests and provide rapid reporting and technical assessment to the appropriate national security agencies and policy makers. The US NDC processes and integrates data and information up to and including the Department of Defense (DoD) TOP SECRET level. The US NDC also serves as the data distribution center for all US government and authorized users for International Monitoring System (IMS) data. The focus of this contract effort is an incremental modernization of the US NDC system to enhance existing data acquisition, detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation, event classification, event reporting, data distribution, and data archiving capabilities to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs as specified in the US NDC System Requirements Document (SRD). Another focus of this incremental modernization effort is to make use of modern software design and development practices to re-architect the US NDC's legacy source code/software baseline that has evolved over the past 15+ years and sustain the present operational systems.<br />The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data acquisition and processing system which provides the capability to receive, process, archive and report events of interest in monitoring nuclear treaty requirements. It acquires waveform data from a global network of seismic, hydroacoustic and infrasonic stations. Data is stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external to AFTAC, and reliably forwarded to a classified processing system. The US NDC receives data from the USAEDS network and from the International Data Center (IDC) originating from International Monitoring System (IMS) sensors on U.S. territory and from other countries. The US NDC performs significant automate processing, followed by interactive review to refine, correct, and display and report results.<br />The US NDC consists of the following components: (a) A 24x7 operations center located in the AFTAC Operations Center (AOC), Patrick AFB, FL (PAFB); (b) A 24x7 alternate (ALT) hot-backup system located at a designated location; (c) A Training System located at the 312th Training Squadron GAFB; (d) A Remote Operations Center (ROC) located at PAFB (used to support unplanned and/or short term AOC outages, fire drills, etc.); (e) The US NDC Sustainment System (SUS, aka the test-bed) and (f) The US NDC Development System (DEVL), both located at AFTAC/PAFB.<br />Current System Parameters include the following:<br />1) Hardware: Sun/Oracle SPARC-based servers and workstations, Sun/Oracle x86 servers, Oracle/SunRay thin-clients, Storage Area Network Drives, LTO3 tape archives<br />2) System Software: Solaris 10, Red Hat Linux 5.4, Oracle 11g<br />3) Applications software: C, C++, FORTRAN, PERL, Scheme, SQL, Lisp, ASM, CSH, Java, Makefile, SH, TCL, YACC<br />The operational US NDC hardware (OPS, Alt, Training System, and Remote Operations Center) along with most of the development/sustainment hardware is and will continue to be maintained through a separate AFTAC maintenance support contract until approximately FY2015. <br />Contractor responsibility will include the development and integration of a total system including ongoing upgrades, advanced geophysical studies and tuning/optimization of software algorithms. All personnel must have a Secret clearance and all key personnel must have a Top Secret (SCI) clearance. A majority of the work will be done within the AFTAC building at Patrick AFB, FL. Therefore, the contractor must have or establish a facility in Florida and have key personnel available to work within AFTAC.<br />Examples of US NDC development and sustainment items include, but are not limited to the following:
<p>MODERNIZATION EFFORTS</p>
<p>1) One of the primary objectives of this modernization effort is to enhance existing data acquisition, detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation, event classification, event reporting, data distribution, and data archiving capabilities to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs as specified in the US NDC System Requirements Document (SRD).</p>
<p>2) A second major objective of this modernization effort is to make use of modern software design and development practices to re-architect the US NDC's legacy source code/software baseline that has evolved over the past 15+ years. This effort shall include recoding the US NDC software baseline to allow the US NDC to take advantage of modern multi-core and 64 bit CPU architectures. The most immediate need is the interactive analysis tool suite.</p>
<p>3) The contractor shall work closely with US NDC government staff in an integrated product team to re-engineer and modernize the US NDC system in a series of builds over the life of the contract. The builds are structured to provide system-wide requirements with a top-down design phase followed by a methodical bottom-up implementation. The modernization schedule will be milestone driven; such that new efforts will not begin until the milestone of previous effort is successfully completed. Some development efforts will overlap so as to efficiently utilize resources. This will be done by adhering to a set of entry/exit criteria established during each phase of development.</p>
<p>4) Develop and/or integrate state-of-the-art algorithms for detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation, event classification, and reporting to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs.</p>
<p>5) The US NDC system currently resides on the SPARC architecture. The US NDC, for multiple reasons, needs to migrate away from SPARC to an x86 architecture. Since the US NDC system is on a 4-5 year equipment replacement cycle, the migration must be synchronized with our hardware purchases. The migration is to occur on the legacy system, but must also be compatible with the modernized system.</p>
<p>6) Integrate improved seismic, hydroacoustic and infrasonic propagation models (velocity, attenuation, etc.) to help improve association, location, magnitude/yield estimation and event classification to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs.</p>
<p>7) Propose, define and manage DT&amp;E and OT&amp;E strategies and processes with explicit exit criteria to ensure that all elements of the SRD and the individual build efforts are satisfied to government expectations.</p>
<p>8) Address new and outstanding SRD requirements.</p>
<p>SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING SYSTEM STUDIES</p>
<p>An integral part of the overall US NDC R&amp;D effort is conducting scientific and engineering System Studies focused on investigating potential system improvements. These potential system upgrades and improvements focus on allowing the US NDC to meet current and future treaty monitoring requirements, improving overall system performance and helping reduce O&amp;M costs. The studies normally range in duration between 3 to 12 months. Efforts requiring more than 12 months are broken into increments with major milestones serving as the logical stopping/starting points between increments.</p>
<p>a. Conduct R&amp;D studies (e.g., hardware, software, databases) to help improve overall system performance and help reduce maintenance costs and man power needs.</p>
<p>b. Conduct scientific studies to help improve detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation and event classification to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs.</p>
<p>O&amp;M EFFORTS</p>
<p>In FY2015, the contractor will begin to support the US NDC government staff with O&amp;M tasks. O&amp;M tasks will include Database, System Administration, Software Engineering, Scientific Programming, Test &amp; Evaluation, and O&amp;M Studies support.</p>
<p>All applicable upgrades to the US NDC shall also be made to the training system located at Goodfellow AFB TX, ROC located at PAFB FL, and to the Alt US NDC, located at a designated location.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time.
<p>The Information Technology Branch (ASC/PKEI), Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, is conducting market research to determine potential sources for a potential contract to read Unique Item Identifiers (UIIs).</p>
<p>The Air Force Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) Program Management Office (PMO) has a requirement for an enterprise information technology solution to read UIIs, use the UII or select asset data attributes to query the AF enterprise data store, and return the full compliment asset pedigree data associated with the asset, including the UII. This Enterprise UII Read (EUR) capability shall be integrated with other AIT capabilities, including but not limited to Asset Management and Point of Maintenance (POMX) via the Enterprise Data Collection Layer (EDCL). A draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to this announcement.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates awarding a firm fixed price (FFP) contract. The anticipated period of performance is six (6) months starting at the date of award.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time.

Firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system to be eligible for award of a contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their CCR.</p>
<p>The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement including whether a set aside is applicable.

Interested contractors shall review, fill-in and return the attached Capabilities Matrix and may also submit a 4 to 8 page capabilities document.

Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements of the SOW. Your statement of capabilities should include the following: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification if applicable. Please submit an electronic copy of your response to tim.hayes@wpafb.af.mil . Statements should be submitted no later than 10 May 2011.</p>

Respondents should not construe this synopsis as a commitment by the Air Force for any purpose. Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought is voluntary and will be used only for the purpose of conducting market research.

<DESC>Synopsis:<br><br>This action is for an FFP Bridge Contract vehicle, with a performance period of five (5) months, to serve in an intermediary capacity to allow continuance of mission critical Communications Security (COMSEC) and Information Assurance (IA) contract provided services under a contract with performance period to expire 30 May 2011.  This Bridge contract will be in effect until the follow-on TO can be executed.  This work falls under NAICS 541512.<br><br>The U.S. Army Communications Security Logistics Activity (CSLA) has the mission of providing Communications Security (COMSEC) and Information Assurance (IA) support for the Department of Army and other assigned organizations in the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside CONUS (OCONUS).  In this role, CSLA: (1) serves as the COMSEC Commodity Manager; (2) directs the operations of the Army COMSEC Wholesale Logistics System; (3) serves as the Army's Functional Proponent for Central Procurement of COMSEC equipment and policy creation authority for Cryptographic Systems; (4) operates Common Tier 1 and serves as the Army's Functional Proponent for the Army Key Management System, and responds to Tier 2 questions; (5) manages the Army COMSEC Commodity Logistics Accounting and Information Management System; (6) conducts Army COMSEC New Equipment Training; (7) inspects, audits, and approves Army COMSEC Accounts throughout the world; (8) evaluates Controlled Cryptographic Incidents; and (9) serves as the principal Army POC with NSA for COMSEC logistics.  In performance of these missions, CSLA has presence at multiple locations CONUS and OCONUS, generally supported by multiple information systems/networks operating at multiple levels of classification.<br><br>The Government is seeking a potential source to assist in the continuance of processes currently in use.  These services are urgently needed because Department of the Army, National Guard and Army Reserve deployed and deploying soldiers need the services that are provided by the proposed action without interruption, and failure to award the proposed contract would result in serious mission impact, compromising national security systems supporting battlefield operations.  The scope of the Bridge Contract will cover three principle areas: <br><br>1.  Training Development and Delivery:  This work includes providing support for the development and delivery of classroom instruction on existing CSLA-managed COMSEC/INFOSEC/IA products such as the Secure Wireline Terminal (SWT), Secure Terminal Equipment (STE), the Sectera KG-235, KG-175 TACLANE, as well as future COMSEC Modernization equipment.<br><br>2.  Cryptographic Modernization:  This program focuses on activities related to acquisition, deployment, and sustainment of new and emerging encryption solutions that are necessary for the assured integrated architecture and enterprise services of the Global Information Grid.  CM actively assists in documenting and analyzing COMSEC, and INFOSEC requirements for input into procurement strategies, spend plans, fielding plans, technical manuals, supportability strategies, and the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) briefings by the HQDA G-6.  Technical activities include Link/Bulk Encryption, Inline Network Encryption, Tactical Radio, SATCOM, Embedded systems (cryptographic chipsets), Secure Voice and Wireless, Interrogator Friend or Foe (IFF), and Test and Evaluation.  These are also complemented by the CM Database, which as a minimum tracks the locations and usage of COMSEC devices.  All contractor personnel in support of the CM program are required to have a Top Secret security clearance at time of award.  Tasks will support the Fort Huachuca site, NCR, and potentially Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.  <br><br>3.  Communications Security Logistics:  A contractor will provide total logistics support for all Army COMSEC equipment; support COMSEC equipment fielding as required by the Department of the Army (DA); manage the Army Wholesale Inventory of COMSEC equipment and spares; and develop the depot workload to support the needs of the Warfighter.<br><br>Security Requirements:  The contractor will be required to have a TOP SECRET facility clearance at time of award.  The contractor will require access to COMSEC and FOUO information.  The contractor will also require access to the SIPRNET system.  All assigned personnel shall be cleared US Citizens in accordance with current Department of Defense (DoD) policy for access to classified systems, networks and facilities at the time of award.  <br><br>Contractor personnel in the following IA positions shall be Information Technology-1 (IT-1) certified: Systems Administrators (SA) and Network Administrators (NA) and for infrastructure devices, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), routers; SAs and NAs for classified systems and devices with privileged-level access to control, manage, or configure IA tools or devices, individual Information Security, networks, devices, and enclaves.<br><br>Qualified, interested sources are requested to provide a capability statement to include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact, company size (please specify as either Large, Foreign, Small, Small Disadvantaged,8(a), Woman-Owned Small Business, or Service-Disabled Small Business).  Potential source must demonstrate capability to perform the following requirement areas and show appropriate certification levels.

<DESC>Title:  Request for Information on Potential Sources for TARDEC Engineering and Technical Service Support<br><br>Important Note:  This notice is strictly a request for information on prospective future sources.  It is not a request for proposals or quotations, and it is not to be construed as a commitment on the Government's part to release a solicitation and/or to award a contract.<br><br>The Office of Small Business Programs at US Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command is releasing this request for information to identify prospective sources capable of providing engineering and technical support services to the US Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) based in Warren, Michigan.   Details are as follows.<br><br>NAICS Code:  541712<br><br>FSC Code:  AC43<br><br>Approximate Level of Effort Hours:  1,000,000<br><br>Likely Period of Performance:  Five Years<br><br>Description of Effort:<br><br>The furnishing of engineering and technical services to assist TARDEC in fulfilling its overriding mission of delivering advanced technology solutions to the US Army's ground vehicle fleet, with special emphasis on unmanned vehicle systems, software engineering lifecycle,  and vehicle electronic  and architecture support to critical customer efforts in ground vehicle technologies.  Execution of these services additionally calls for support to the Army Program Executive Offices (PEOs) for Ground Combat Systems, Integration, and Combat Support and Combat Service Support; to the TARDEC Army and Technology Objective (ATO) and Advanced Technology Demonstrator (ATD) programs; and to successor or related Army and Government organizations in the areas of ground robotics and vehicle electronics at a SECRET level of clearance.  It encompasses Post Production Software Support (PPSS), lifecycle software engineering support to the PEOs for the development and acquisition of weapon system platforms, and support of projects within TARDEC that are managed and carried out by TARDEC personnel.<br><br>Engineering and technical service support to TARDEC entails a systems engineering approach to analyzing, developing and enhancing ongoing TARDEC programs.  Specific work areas include Engineering Analyses; System Requirements Definition; System Design; System Fabrication; Software Development; System Integration; System Testing; System Maintenance; Experimentation and Testing; Software Process Engineering; Lifecycle Software Engineering; System Enhancement; Systems Engineering; Program Manager Outreach; and Administrative Support.  The performance of work directives under these work areas, which primarily apply to Department of Defense ground vehicles, requires the consideration of cost variables and affordability issues and the conduct of cost/technical trade-off analyses.  Support to TARDEC also involves the maintenance and upgrading of TARDEC laboratories and laboratory tools, software applications, and ground vehicle subsystems including electronics, supporting software, and structural and survivability components associated with TARDEC programs.  Performance of assignments calls for a mix of on-site and off-site personnel and may take place at both CONUS and OCONUS locations to include contractor facilities, Government facilities, and overseas locations (e.g. Kuwait, Afghanistan and Iraq).  SECRET clearances would be required for all contractor personnel.<br><br>Responses:<br><br>If you consider your firm capable of providing comprehensive engineering and technical support services to TARDEC, as set forth above, please respond to this sources-sought request with the following information.<br><br>1) Company Name, Location, CAGE Code<br><br>2) Socioeconomic Status (based on NAICS Code 541712, which has a Small Business ceiling of 500 employees)<br><br>3) Past Engineering/Technical Support Contracts:  List all prior Government contracts that your company has had over the past three years, but no more than ten in total, for work that's similar in whole or in part to the TARDEC service support as described above; cite contract number, dollar value and POC and give a brief description of what the contract was for. The majority (50% or greater) of experience identified should derive directly from your company rather than from another business concern that your company may have been partnered or teamed with.<br><br>4) Capability Statement:  Explain, in no more than two pages, your company's capabilities, emphasizing how they correspond to the elements of TARDEC service support as noted above.  Also specify in your response the extent that your own firm would be capable of performing the many facets of the effort without reliance on partners or other entities.<br><br>5) Subcontracting and Teaming Availability:  Would you be interested in subcontracting opportunities under the effort described above?  And would you have an interest in teaming with one or more other firms to compete for the effort as a prime contractor candidate?<br><br>Submit responses as well as questions to Mr. Ronald Fiorani, TACOM LCMC Office of Small Business Programs, at DAMI@SmallBusinessOffice@conus.army.mil no later than 5:00 PM EDT on 26 May 2011.  Please enter in the subject line either "Response to TARDEC Market Survey" or "Question on TARDEC Market Survey" as appropriate.<br>

<DESC><p>Introduction</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>The information from this market research will help the DMID, NIAID, NIH, and DHHS, plan their acquisition strategy. Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research for the investigation, control and prevention of diseases caused by all infectious agents other than HIV. Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DMID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new vaccines and biologics against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a coordinated evaluation and testing services program to provide preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical testing support for multiple vaccine and biologic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. The suite of testing services will encompass those activities commonly associated with the testing of vaccine and biologic products for infectious disease required for Investigational New Drug (IND) application and/or Biologic License Application (BLA). Consequently, DMID recognizes that to obtain the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in this solicitation, individual organizations will likely need the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in this contract and each awarded Task Order.</p>
<p>DMID anticipates awarding a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract that provides a guaranteed minimum award to the organization or consortium that best meets the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements of this solicitation. Sample Task Orders are provided in the RFP solely to evaluate offeror responses and capabilities. Task Orders for specific tasks will be issued after award of the Basic Contract.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this solicitation is to establish a NIAID resource entitled "Evaluation and Testing Services (ETS) for Vaccines and Other Biologics for Infectious Diseases" that provides a suite of preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical testing services for vaccines and other biologic products. While the overall suite of testing services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of vaccine and biological product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway. These services are intended to help a wide variety of investigators in a broad number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I/II/III trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter Phase I/II/III trials.</p>

<p>The information from this market research will help the DMID, NIAID, NIH, and DHHS, plan their acquisition strategy.  Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.</p>
<p>Background:  Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to study control and prevent diseases caused by all infectious agents (except HIV). Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DMID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services. (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new vaccines and biologics against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a product development-oriented program to provide preclinical development support for multiple vaccine and biologic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. The suite of services will encompass those activities commonly associated with the development of vaccine and biologic products for infectious disease required for Investigational New Drug (IND) application and/or Biologic License Application (BLA). Consequently, DMID recognizes that to obtain the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in this solicitation, individual organizations will likely need the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in this contract and each awarded Task Order.</p>
<p>NIAID anticipates award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to one organization that meets the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements of the solicitation, providing a guaranteed minimum award.  Task orders for specific tasks requiring specialized expertise will be issued after the award of the IDIQ contract.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:  The purpose of this solicitation is to establish a NIAID resource entitled "Manufacture and Characterization Services (MCS) for the Development of Vaccines and Other Biologics for Infectious Diseases" that provides a suite of product development preclinical services from early feasibility studies through manufacture and release of Phase I/II material. While the overall suite of services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of vaccine and biological product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway.  These services are intended to help a wide variety of investigators in a broad number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter Phase I/II trials.</p>
<p>Project Requirements: The Contractor shall provide DMID with a broad and flexible range of development-oriented capabilities to provide preclinical development support for multiple vaccine and biologic products when such products emerge from investigator-initiated research studies or other sources identified by DMID Program staff.

<DESC>1. INTRODUCTION:

This sources sought notice is for INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and SHALL NOT be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced and interested potential sources. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement.

Currently, VISN 8 Medical Centers have limited opportunities for employees in grades GS-01 thru GS-05 and equivalent Wage Grades. To improve upward mobility, diversity, loyalty, talent, and patient care, employees in entry-level positions need new learning opportunities and a better chance to succeed. In order to enhance diversity within the organization, and to improve EEO performance, there is a need for employees to learn new tasks, and learn how to develop skills for successful career advancement.  To provide this opportunity, senior leadership has decided to host a School at Work (SAW) Program to develop employee computer skills, math, reading, grammar, writing, medical terminology, principals of patient safety and satisfaction, and organizational skills.

School at Work (SAW) is a six month career development system that will be delivered within the seven VISN 8 Medical Centers using a blended learning system: on-line coursework, DVD classroom sessions, and participant workbooks. Instructional tools will be provided by a workplace education and e-learning company. During the SAW program, participants develop a Career and Learning Plan (CLP) to help them identify and achieve personal career goals through self-assessments and other exercises. Students will attend class two hours per week for twenty-two (22) weeks for a total of six months.  Each facility conducting a SAW session will have a Coach and Career Advisor provided by each Medical Center. The Coach facilitates the blended learning system committing 4 hours per week (two hours in the classroom, and approximately two hours in the management of the program). The coach serves as a project manager for the SAW class, works closely with internal staff (e.g. student supervisors), keeps attendance records, and monitors the completion of the online components. The coach must have good computer skills, strong communication and facilitation skills, suggested previous experience in education, recruiting, or human resources, and must be familiar with the healthcare organization.  

The Career Advisor will meet one-on-one with students throughout the course to help them map out their Career and Learning Plan.  A Career Advisor should meet with each student, one-on-one, 3-4 times during the SAW program.

School at Work provides career development opportunities to employees who are hard-working, committed to a future in healthcare, have potential, but cannot advance without more education. The focus of School at Work (SAW) is to develop a highly skilled, customer-focused work force that will provide exemplary leadership for the 21st century.


 2. OBJECTIVES:

This is a Request for Information (RFI) for Commercial Service in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.1, (FAR) 13.5 under Simplified Acquisition Procedures, (FAR) 37.1 Personal Services Contracts, and 5 USC Sec 3109. No proposals are requested by this announcement; all responses shall be solely in the form of information and materials.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. Further, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals or any cost or pricing data. Personal Services contractors are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be the sole responsibility of the contractor. All submissions will be treated as business confidential materials, become Government property, and will not be returned.

Background

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), is responsible for effective administration of Veterans monetary and cemetery benefits thereby producing a high level of customer satisfaction for our nation's Veterans.  In meeting these goals and striving to perpetuate high quality, prompt and seamless services to Veterans, the VA requires Contractor services to provide necessary software support to sustain the VA's Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Compensation and Pension Records Interchange (CAPRI) application while legacy computer applications are modernized in-house and/or under separate contractual vehicles. VistA utilizes the Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System (MUMPS).  CAPRI was written using the Embarcadero Delphi application development language.  

The CAPRI project is an Information Technology (IT) initiative to improve service to disabled veterans by promoting efficient communication between the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). Online access to medical data enhances the timeliness of the benefits determination. The CAPRI software acts as a bridge between the VBA and VHA information systems. It offers VBA Rating Veteran Service Representatives and Decision Review Officers help in building the rating decision documentation through online access to Electronic Health Record (EHR) data found in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).  It also offers VHA Compensation and Pension (C&P) staff an easy, standardized way of recording C&P Examination reports.

CAPRI is available at all VA Medical Centers and Regional Offices at more than 1,300 sites of care.  Features include: a national user account option with a single access code from which authorized users can view a Veteran's entire VA health record from any site where the Veteran has been seen; customizable reports and health summaries; C&P exam requests and results; a search feature that enables users to review progress notes and discharge summary text; access to current and past Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) C&P claims activity; Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE)/Department of Defense (DoD) health data; and access to VistAWeb for quickly viewing data at remote locations.

CAPRI builds upon existing VHA information security approaches. In addition to using established mechanisms to ensure only authorized access to medical data, CAPRI adds a level of security by allowing VBA users to read but not alter electronic medical record information. CAPRI also provides innovative improvements for medical centers by integrating highly detailed C&P Rating examination results into the Veterans' medical records. Previously, these reports were not retained online in medical center computer systems but were archived onto paper. This procedure precluded the sharing of clinically useful data.

Initially developed specifically for VBA, the utility of CAPRI has been expanded to other user groups that include VHA, Office of the Medical Inspector, Office of Information, Research, and Veteran Service Officers. Recently, most of the newest features of CAPRI are specifically targeted at adding features to be used by VHA C&P providers and staff.

Requirements  

The scope of this work effort is the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of CAPRI with support for Development, Modernization, and Enhancements (DM&E) to the application, as determined and approved by the Government.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Service Area Office East, Network Contracting Activity 8, West Palm Beach, FL intends to solicit on a sole source basis for parts, labor, digital control programming, digital outputs and exhaust fan cycling for 52 existing proprietary Siemens air handler units, as well as all related wiring and construction modification as necessary. This is not a solicitation. This is market research for informational purposes only. Do not submit bids or proposals for this project. The government is seeking any manufacturer or company who is authorized to modify and/or enhance the proprietary Siemens System 600/Apogee System and can provide an "equal" or better product. The project requires the installation of panels, controllers, power supplies and relays to control the minimum OA dampers on 52 AHU's.  In order to prevent rapid closing/slamming of the dampers, restrictors shall be installed to allow dampers to close slowly, minimum of 15 seconds to close. The project also includes point creation within the BAS as well as programming of the system for efficient use. In addition to controlling the outside air dampers, this project also requires the modification of the exhaust air system in the building.  In general, by closing off 159,000 cfm of supply air entering the building, we must also limit exhausting a percentage of that air to maintain a building with a slightly positive pressure.  Therefore, this project also calls for the programming of certain exhaust fans to be cycled off during modified outside air dampers events. A single emergency point shall be created and graphically represented on the main graphic screen and shall shut off all dampers and associated exhaust fans upon with an interacting icon on the graphic's screen.  The OA Damper project is also intended to be used in the future with daytime control CO2 controls. This project will also provide a means to close outside air dampers to the facility when perimeter outdoor environmental concerns are present surrounding the facility.  

Firm shall be capable of completing performance of this project within twelve weeks of receipt of Notice to Proceed.  BAS parts are required for this project and are available on GS Schedules.  Pricing from GSA Schedules are required.  Work shall be performed at the VA Medical Center located at West Palm Beach, Florida, Building #1.

If you are qualified and authorized to provide the specified equipment, parts and labor on the Siemen's System 600/ Apogee System and provide necessary construction to integrate the system with existing systems in the building, submit your authorization and qualifications to Deborah Murphy, Contracting Officer, Department of Veterans Affairs, SAO East, NCA 8, Building 12, 7305 N Military Trail, West Palm Beach, FL  33410. Email submissions are acceptable. Due date for all submissions is January 28, 2011 by 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time. Please send your email submissions to Deborah.Murphy3@va.gov.  If you have any questions, please submit them via email.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service intends to award a sole source contract to the Government of Ontario, Canada, (Ministry of Natural Resources, AFFMB Aviation Services) using simplified acquisition procedures for rent/lease of an MNR helicopter,including pilot and fuel, to support the FY11 Breeding Pair Population Waterfowl Survey. This survey is conducted to fulfill the United State's obligations toward International Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Waterfowl breeding populations will be surveyed within Ontario, Quebec and Labrador Canada to count waterfowl and collect data. The flight surveys are to be conducted between April 30, 2011and June 30, 2011, depending on weather conditions. Because the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources is a government agency, their helicopters are able to access jet fuel caches which are reserved for Government aircraft in remote areas. Estimated number of hours to conduct this survey is 40 hours. The helicopter flights are to be conducted in Stratum 51 in Ontario and Strata 68 and 69 in Quebec and Labrador, Canada. The survey and identification project require maneuvering the helicopter at the edge of the performance envelope in a variety of remote wilderness habitats in northern Canada.
The J&A is as follows:
SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATIONFor Rent/Lease Gov't of Ontario (MNR) Helicopter, incl Pilot & Fuel
 SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000 
DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT
The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) have experienced and trained pilots who are familiar with natural resource flying within Canada. The MNR Aviation program is familiar and knowledgeable of Waterfowl Population Data Capture Methods consistent with those practiced by the Joint Cooperative USFWS and Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) programs. This familiarity results in flight efficiencies potentially reducing required flights times up to 15 percent. MNR aircraft are equipped with aircraft tracking systems that are monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by their operations centre to ensure prompt response as necessary for any emergencies in remote locations.  No other vendor can provide these services in these locations.
MNR's pricing has consistently been 30%, or more, lower than that of comparable commercial rates. Their fees are structured to exclude profit, and only cover the actual operating costs, much like the rates issued by the Aviation Management Directorate (AMD) within the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI).  In addition, MNR aircraft have a proven history of reliability, high maintenance standards, and safety similar to those standards adopted by the U.S. Department of Interior Aviation programs. Total cost of is $45,400.00.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION 
Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This means that the supplies or services can only be obtained from one firm usually due to their unique technical expertise. (FAR 6.302-1)


EFFORTS TO LOCATE OTHER SOURCES
Because no other vendor can offer these benefits, it is cost effective to contract with this vendor to capture these data which are critical to the Service's population estimation of breeding waterfowl on a timely basis.  Vendor will be available between April 30, 2011 and June 30, 2011 to conduct survey missions.  Vendor possesses a valid United States passport and will be available for required foreign travel between these dates.

<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:matthew.kopp@navy.mil">POC</a>
<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT
Naval Surface Warfare Center-Panama City Division (NSWC-PCD) conducts Research and Development (R&D) of techniques and technologies supporting expeditionary warfare in a littoral environment. NSWC-PCDâ€™s mission includes mine warfare (both mine countermeasures and mining), amphibious warfare, diving and life support, special warfare, and other missions conducted in the coastal region. Within these mission areas, NSWC-PCD is responsible for the full spectrum of R&D, acquisition, and support functions. Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis, and evaluation of concepts; systems and subsystems; logistics; and development of operational concepts and tactics.
 
This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated under FAR 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open from 28 April 2011 to 27 April 2012. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: 
(1) environmental data collection, monitoring, analysis, or display; (2) multifunction maritime and underwater sensing designs and technology; (3) image and sensor data processing; (4) innovative and non-conventional concepts for application of technology, engineering and systems to support coastal operations and coastal warfare including waterproofing, shock mitigation and isolation, and human systems interfaces; (5) lasers, radar, millimeter wave, or other high energy sensors or weapons; (6) command, control, communication, localization, navigation, guidance and data transmission in the air, sea, or through the ground; (7) autonomous and remotely controlled vehicles: air, surface, sea surface, undersea, or ground; (8) underwater navigation technologies; (9) techniques or methods to increase the autonomy of current manned systems and unmanned vehicles (air, surface, sea surface, or ground); (10) information processing, fusion, and display; (11) data fusion/correlation for applications involving methodologies to translate/correlate data between different acoustic sensors/frequencies so that data/images taken with one sensor can be translated into equivalent data/images with another system; (12) chemical / biological individual protection; (13) kinetic and mechanistic studies of atmospheric transformations in enclosed environments; (14) life cycle cost reduction initiatives; (15) gas sensors and CO2 removal techniques; (16) active and passive thermal protection; (17) improved decompression technologies; (18) diver life support technologies; contaminated water diver protection; and (19) biometric sensor development.
Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, non-profit organizations, institution of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia comprising such concerns.
 NSWC-PCD encourages participation by small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, and historically black colleges and universities.
The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be: (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) funded between $10,000 to $1,000,000 with the size dependent upon the topic (although NSWC-PCD reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic; (4) NSWC-PCD is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they have never been sold before); (5) NSWC-PCD is seeking proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution.
 Proposals for evolutionary engineering of improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and are not allowed. In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as an initial step, interested parties should submit an initial synopsis (common referred to as a â€œwhite paperâ€). The white paper should not exceed 10 pages and should include an Executive Summary (short paragraph) on the effort, a technical description of the effort, a synopsis of qualifications based on accomplishments, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. Offerors should submit the white paper electronically, referencing this BAA. Offerors shall not be reimbursed for the submittal of their white paper.
 Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be invited to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper. NSWC-PCD reserves the right to invite proposals from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Any such invitation does not assure an offeror of subsequent funding. NSWC-PCD will acknowledge receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by email. White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to NSWC-PCD specific mission areas; (3) degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NSWC-PCD programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to NSWC-PCD with unrestricted (Government Purpose) rights; (4) the offerorâ€™s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) realism of the proposed cost and the availability of funds.
 These criteria are listed in descending order of importance and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price. 
THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. For efforts funded as legally binding commitments, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and historically black colleges and universities. It is important to notify potential offerors that each grant or cooperative agreement placed under this announcement to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: â€œAs a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.
 If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.â€ If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation.
White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of the BAA.
 There is no set date for submission. The following e-mail points of contact are provided for information regarding submission of white papers and proposals: Primary POC â€“ matthew.kopp@navy.mil Contract Specialist. Backup POC â€“ donald.bickford@navy.mil Contracting Officer. Please refer to BAA # N61331-11-Q-MK05 in all correspondence.

The report should assist EPA in evaluating the impact of ARRA on water quality management planning efforts and identify opportunities to support innovative planning activities that will maximize both environmental and economic benefits post-ARRA. The contractor will also assist EPA in developing and implementing an EPA-sponsored national meeting to discuss the results of the analysis, solicit input from State and local partners, and identify lessons learned in the oversight and management of ARRA activities.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, New York District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the Operational Readiness Training Complex (ORTC) project, Fort Drum, NY (Jefferson County). The estimated range is between $25,000,000 and $50,000,000. <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br><br>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br><br> <br><br>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in Jefferson County (Fort Drum), NY? <br><br>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br><br>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br><br>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br><br>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br><br>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid/proposal due to a PLA?<br><br>(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a New York district contract?<br><br> <br><br>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 Addendum 1-Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>Radiated emissions testing, according to MIL-STD 464A/C and MIL-STD 461E/F, involves the accurate and repeatable determination of the radiated electric field strength from a device under test.  Accurate electric field measurement requires suitable antennas, preamplifiers, cables, and other accessories to span the mandated frequency range (since these devices are frequency dependent).  To provide mobility, that an emissions test might be conducted off-site, these devices must be manageable in size, weight, and portability.  Currently, the EMRE facility has the equipment and ability to provide on-site radiated emissions testing in accordance with MIL-STDs 464A/C and 461E/F.  However, EMRE does not currently have the equipment to provide mobile, off-site, emissions testing.  Such testing requires smaller, more portable equipment (including antennas, preamplifiers, cables, and other accessories).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this procurement is A11PS00279 and this is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This requirement is a 100% set-aside for Small Business. The anticipated award will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract; the award will be made based on the lowest price. The solicitation shall incorporate provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-50. The suggested North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336321.
Background The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Justice Services, Operations Division have vehicles that need to be fitted with emergency lighting, audible warning, control console, and other miscellaneous mission specific equipment. The installation is to be in compliance and consistent with equipment manufacturers' instructions for the item, this would include all non-OEM after-market items which are purchased in order to make the vehicle ready for police work.  The contractor will install all of the emergency vehicle equipment in a consistent standardized manner. The contractor will insure that every vehicle is identical in the manner that each component included in the upfitting is the same throughout all vehicles, to include the routes in which the wiring is laid throughout the interior of the vehicle. The wiring must include protective sheathing in areas which may subject the wiring to crimping and/or wear that may cause failure to the equipment which it is connected and potentially damage to the vehicle. The standard for our vehicles includes that all connections utilize butt connector, solder and shrink wrap at connection points.   
Requirements The contractor must adhere to the BIA vehicle upfitting standards for equipment. The BIA equipment that has been established for the unmarked Special Agent Vehicle are as follows for this vehicle build, NO equipment substitutions will be accepted:
2011 Dodge Police Packaged Charger, 5.7 Hemi model GSA Autochoice 17R - SEDAN, REAR WHEEL DRIVE, POLICE USE, 4 DOOR
ELUC2S010W UNIVERSAL UNDERCOVER LED INSERT, WHITE: 6 GENERATION 3 LED'SThese lights are to be used as inserts in the four corners of the police vehicle to enhance the visibility while responding. This particular light is weatherproof and comes standard with three interchangeable lenses to enhance the light output. The area on the vehicle where the light is mounted will dictate which lens will be utilized to ensure the greatest light reflection for greater visibility. It has an in-line flasher with 30 patterns and the ability to synchronize with other flasher units. TOMAR RECT-14LS HIGH POWER GRILL LIGHT AND 200S-BR-2 HIGH POWER LOW PROFILE VISOR MOUNTED WARNING LIGHTThe emergency lights identified for the grill and overhead visor mounting application are the only lights have potted (completely sealed) electronics, feature total internal reflection, which doesn't utilize metallic reflection technology, which provides an extremely wide angle of visibility without the  use of diffusion outer lens, and does not fade when exposed to sunlight like the metallic reflection models. These lights have 12 high power LED's which is the brightest on the market to provide the greatest visibility during an emergency response. C3100CH 100 WATT SIREN SPEAKERSThis emergency speaker is specifically designed to be mounted on the Charger. The speaker meets SAE J1849 specifications.JOTTO DESK MODEL 425-6636 POLICE EQUIPMENT CONSOLEThis is the console which holds the vehicle equipment to include: radios, siren and light controller and auxiliary radios specific to an agency. This particular model is the only one found that will fit the new interior design of the 2011 Dodge Chargers with the specifications set for our radio and siren needs. L-18-LED LITTLELITE MAPLIGHT MOUNTED ON POLICE CONSOLEThis piece of equipment is mounted on the police console and provides lighting to the Agent without having to turn on the vehicle interior lighting during covert operations. The light is made with a flexible connector which can be moved to illuminate an area without lighting the complete interior of the vehicle like and overhead dome light.295SLA6 WHELEN SINGLE UNIT SIREN WITH 9 SWITCH LIGHT CONTROLThis siren and light control unit is currently in use in a majority of our police vehicles, due to an attempt to standardize vehicles throughout our agency, we would continue to utilize this unit. The unit meets or exceeds Class A requirements of SAE, KKK1822 and California Title 13 specifications. The unit is an electronic siren and integrated light controller with 9 individually programmable switches. It features a momentary switch which is utilized for our mounted gun locks, 19 scan lock siren tones, and compatible with the 100 watt speaker. TOMAR LSTICK-14W8-B 8 MODULE 38.5" REAR DECK LIGHTThis directional rear deck mounted warning light we use is versatile in the way the light is manufactured, no additional flasher units are needed and this unit is compatible with the siren/light controller. This unit offers response flash pattern, left/right/center out directional flash patterns with scrolling flash rate feature which makes the light highly visible. The housing for each LED module is hermetically sealed from condensation and dust; other products have a heat vent, which allows dust to enter the unit and causing the light to eventually become less effective. These units are currently in use on our vehicles. The required modules must feature waterproof internal connectors. The required directional light bar must have potted (completely sealed) electronics, feature total internal reflection, which doesn't utilize metallic reflection technology, which provides an extremely wide angle of visibility without the  use of diffusion outer lens, and does not fade when exposed to sunlight like the metallic reflection models. This directional light can be serviced by removing two (2) screws to replace a faulty LED module.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) and is unrestricted. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-50, March 16, 2011. The Government intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a single Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract with one (1) base year and two (2) option years. The subsequent contract will be awarded using FAR Part 13.5 procedures.<br><br>This solicitation is being reissued pursuant to the policy memorandum dated 24 November 2010 by the Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, titled "Improving Competition in Defense Procurements." The previous solicitation number was W91QUF1106C001 with a closing date of 26 April 2011.<br><br>This solicitation is for a non-personal health care services contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical, professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The contractor indemnifies the Government for any liability producing act or omission by the contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Government requires the contractor to maintain medical liability insurance, in coverage amounts which are not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned. The contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services, contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. The minimum of $3,000 shall be ordered on this contract and the maximum contract amount over the life of the contract, including all options if exercised, is $400,000. The minimum contract amount of $3,000 may be met by one or more orders during the base year of the contract.<br><br>Primary place of performance is Togus VA Hospital, Augusta, ME, with periodic performance at various armory locations throughout the State of Maine. The capability of contractors to provide mobile-based medical services for any and all specialities in the contract is desired. Description of requirement: The Maine Army National Guard (MEARNG) requires Periodic Health Assessments (PHA) to include: dental screening and treatment, immunization updating, physical exams, phlebotomy, vision screening, womens health screening and MEDPROS and DENCLASS systems updating of service members during a one (1) year base period beginning 2 June 2011, the anticipated award date, with two (2) option years exercised at the discretion of the Government. The government may inspect facilities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. (MEDPROS and DENCLASS are available through the Army Medical Operation Data System [MODS] at www.mods.army.mil.) Performance Standards: In accordance with the Performance Work Statement, the contractor shall provide, in a fixed or mobile setting, all management, labor, material, personal equipment, certifications and supplies necessary to provide Medical services, dental examinations, dental treatments, health and dental record updating, MEDPROS and DENCLASS updating. <br><br>The first anticipated task order against the resulting ID/IQ contract is planned for 4 June 2011 for a PHA/PDHRA event.<br><br>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision at 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors---Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Award will be made based on an evaluation of the criteria of price, past performance and technical capability. Provision for Evaluation: Award will be made to the contractor whose offer represents the Best Value to the Government. In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.304 and 15.305 and the clause at 52.212-2, the Government will consider the following for award: 1) Price; 2) Past Performance; 3) Technical Capability. A consideration when evaluating technical capability will be continuity of personnel offered by the contractor. Continuity of personnel will limit the need for constant training of new personnel month to month. Past Performance and Technical Capability, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The offeror must demonstrate in the proposal the capability to meet all contract requirements through past performance at similar events (assessing military members for medical fitness to standards in accordance with Army Regulation 40-501, chapter 3, 7 and 8), either as the prime or first tier subcontractor, and by identification of key personnel that have past performance experience. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price standpoint. Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss, or revise your proposal. Offerors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their proposal. Request for such information does not constitute discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. <br><br>Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs): <br>Priced 0001, Physician Services<br>Priced 0002, Physician Assistant / Nurse Practioner Services<br>Priced 0003, Registered Nurse Services<br>Priced 0004, Phlebotomist Services<br>Priced 0005, Dentist Services<br>Priced 0006, Optometrist Services<br>Priced 0007, Mobile medical/dental exam facilities<br>Priced 0008, Army Contractor Manpower Reporting Requirement (yearly requirement).

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NFFP7300-11-04142SRG.</p>

<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following <br />commercial services:</p>
<p>The NOAA Diving Center is in need of a bi-annual air testing program that would provide an analysis of the compressed breathing-air from the compressors that are used by various NOAA Diving Units and ships. Since we have already tested for the first half of year this purchase order would be for the last semi-annual of FY2011 with 3 option periods.</p>
<p>Air testing program must meet the safety requirements set forth in the OSHA 29 CFR, 1910 Subpart T, and the NOAA Diving Regulations, NAO-209, 123 which state that compressed air from all active compressors shall be tested every six (6) months by an approved method. We use the U.S. Navy Diving Air Standards. This is a mandatory safety requirement. The test would be done using the U.S. Navy Diving Air Standards to meet OSHA guidelines for air purity for divers. We need the company to be an analytical laboratory that has been accredited by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />NOAA Diving Center requires that the results of the air testing be available within 24 hours of receiving the sample and they have online report access for our unit or ships to retrieve anywhere/anytime. The company selected must be able to provide both the 24 electronic results as well as the last 5 years of results on any given compressor for comparison purposes should a compressor fail. Also the company selected must have a PhD chemist on staff to provide guidance to our customers should a test fail and an afterhours technical staff as well.</p>
<p>The company chosen will supply each unit with a sampling kit with everything needed to do the testing. Each kit will provide detailed instructions on how to perform the test. The postage will be paid by this company to and from a pre-paid shipping label that will be provided. We typically use 2-3 day air, but require the capability of doing overnight shipping to a unit or vessel if needed. Our units and ships are around the country including Alaska and Hawaii. Occasionally we have a ship that maybe in a remote are that would need a sampling kit sent to them. The Semi-Annual timeframes are January and July with some units testing out of the normal timeframe due to field seasons or sailing schedules. The following is what we are asking for this quote:</p>
<p>-US Navy Air analysis testing - (Hi/Low pressure)- QTY: 38<br />-Nitrox Oxygen Compatible analysis - QTY: 4<br />-Addition sampling in case of failure (Retesting) - QTY: 4<br />-Postage for above (estimate since they are all over country)</p>
<p><br />(VII) Date(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance (enter complete delivery address in one continuous sentence). Delivery shall be FOB Destination.</p>
<p>Period of performance shall be base year: June 1, 2011 through September 30, 2011. <br />Option Period #1: October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012<br />Option Period #2: October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013<br />Option Period #3: October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Schedule Items Definition(s):  

Casefinding: This process incorporates screening patient records using a coding system and the electronic casefinding module which is embedded in the software system.  Each chart is reviewed using current industry standards for casefinding searches such as the North American Association of Central Cancer Registry guidelines, Commission on Cancer guidelines and the National Cancer Institute standards. Once the case is screened and accepted into the database it is flagged as Suspense with the demographics and primary site coded.  Casefinding must be completed within 4 months of diagnosis to meet the industry standards. 

Abstracting: Documented cancer case abstracts are completed on each cancer case by encompassing the full and complete data set required in addition to supplemental and optional fields.  The patient's workup, diagnosis, staging, protocol, treatment and survival information are all coded and entered into the oncology software system.  Text to validate the codes is required. The cases must successfully complete screening with several required data edit sets before being considered complete. Abstracting requires a highly technical set of skills and only Certified Tumor Registrars (CTR) may complete abstracts.
Cancer case abstracts must be completed within 6 months of date of first contact /or date of diagnosis to be considered compliant with national standards. 

Follow-up:  Annually all cancer cases must be checked for cancer status and survival.  This information is recorded with the most current data available.  The outcome data must include recurrence information, subsequent therapy, date of last contact, vital status and cancer status. Death information including autopsy and death certificate validation codes must be entered as part of the follow-up process.  The requirement for coding follow-up data includes having current information on 80% of all patients since registry reference date and 90% of patients registered within the last five years.  

Consult Hours:   This item would be charged when data is pulled for the Cancer Committee or Administration.  This would also include various tasks related to assisting with data submission to the state of  Nebraska and the National VA Central Office. It would also cover any assistance with Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons survey preparation that may be needed.  (On-site consult hours  - fees would have to include travel with receipts.) 

Rejects:  This is a minimal fee to cover costs of reviewing cases that turn out not to be reportable cases and therefore need to be deleted from the data base.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers IAW FAR 13.106-2-Evaluation of Quotations or Offers:<br /><br /><strong>Price-<br /></strong>(1) The Government will evaluate offers for award based on the realism and reasonableness of total price proposed for the solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best price, terms, and conditions.</p>
<p>(3) Realism-Offerors are advised that unrealistically proposed prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offer does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. Realism accesses whether the proposed price is compatible with the proposal scope of effort and the requirements of solicitation.</p>
<p>(4) Reasonable is defined as a price that provides best value to the Government when considering current market prices, wage determinations included in the solicitation and technical capabilities of the offerors. Also, a fair price should ensure the offer a reasonable profit commensurate with performance.</p>
<p><strong>Technical-<br /></strong>The proposal will be determined technically acceptable if quote is composed of the items listed in the SOW. If an equal is being proposed, please provide the specifications for any items that are substituted. Clearly indicated the substitutions.</p>
<p><strong>Past Performance-<br /></strong>Submit at least two (2) contracts performed in the last three to five years, comparable in value and requirements. Include name of company/agency, contract number, point of contact (name and phone number), and total dollar value.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be given an overall general assessment risk rating. Performance risk relates to the assessment of an offeror's present and past work record to assess confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements.</p>
<p><br />The following definitions will be used in assessing performance risks:</p>
<p><strong>High</strong>-Significant doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record that the offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong> - Some doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record that the offeror can perform the proposed efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Low</strong> - Little doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record that the offeror can perform the proposed efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Not Applicable</strong> - No significant performance record is identifiable.</p>
<p>Past performance is equal to price. Offer must be found technically acceptable.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br /><br />FAR 52.203-3 Gratuities (Apr 1984),<br /><br />FAR 52.203-12 Limitation on Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions (Oct 2010),<br /><br />FAR 52.204-4 Printed or Copied Double-Sided on Recycled Paper (Aug 2000),<br /><br />FAR 52.204-6, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number (Apr 2008), If a copy of the provisions are needed, the can be found on arnet.gov/far,<br /><br />FAR 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal (Aug 1999),<br /><br />Each offeror shall complete paragraphs (c) through (o) of the provision at FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (APR 2011) if offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<p><strong>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME</strong>: Air Force Research Laboratory<br />Munitions Directorate <br />101 W. Eglin Blvd <br />Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810</p>
<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE</strong>: Armament Technology</p>
<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE</strong>: Amendment #2 to BAA-RWK-10-0001, dated 28 April 2011</p>
<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER:</strong> BAA-RWK-10-0001</p>
<p><strong>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) NUMBER(S):</strong> 12.800 Air Force Defense Research Sciences Program</p>
<p><strong>WHITE PAPER DUE DATE AND TIME:</strong> This BAA will remain open through 30 April 2012, or until amended or superseded. It may be reissued and/or amended periodically, as needed. White papers may be submitted at any time during the open period to afrl.rwk.baaworkflow@eglin.af.mil.</p>
<p><strong>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>This is a Broad Agency Announcement of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW) under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs. A program should be designed to demonstrate well-defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort. Any significant testing is unlikely; however, there is a possibility of experimental testing to support battle lab experiments proposed under this BAA. Occasionally, AFRL/RW will have more specific research interests or topics that warrant specific attention. Under those circumstances, a specific BAA will be issued describing the requirement in greater detail, defining funding availability, elaborating on white paper or proposal submission due date and format, and possibly providing more specific evaluation criteria. Programs to support Team Eglin Technology Demonstration Programs may also be considered under this BAA.</p>
<p>AFRL/RW contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in armament technology. This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest to this Directorate. Offerors contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/RW should carefully examine this BAA, and are also strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate AFRL/RW technical Point of Contact (POC) identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest AFRL/RW may have in a specific research project.</p>
<p>AFRL/RW is the primary Air Force organization concerned with conventional munitions technology development. AFRL/RW plans and executes research, development, and test of conventional munitions, and supports conventional munitions Wings/Groups or Weapons Program Offices. There are four divisions within the Munitions Directorate that conduct research and development (R&amp;D). They are the Demonstration Division, the Advanced Guidance Division, the Strategic Planning and Assessment Division, and the Ordnance Division.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DEMONSTRATION DIVISION (RWA)<br /></span></strong>The Demonstration Division (RWA) directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile airframes, and submunition design and dispensing. RWA also integrates optimal subsystems, performs tests, and conducts flight demonstrations. RWA consists of the Systems of Systems Branch (RWAS), and the Flight Vehicles Integration Branch (RWAV).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ADVANCED GUIDANCE DIVISION (RWG)<br /></span></strong>The Advanced Guidance Division (RWG) conducts research and directs exploratory and advanced development in guidance and control technology to support development of autonomous, precision-guided munitions. The relevant technologies are in two general areas: seekers and conventional guidance and control. The seeker technologies include electro-optical, infrared, millimeter-wave, and radio frequency seekers for air-to-air and air-to-surface conventional weapons, exointerceptors, and submunition guidance. This includes signal/image processing algorithms and processors. Conventional guidance and control includes inertial sensors, global positioning system (GPS) receivers, antijam GPS technologies, and relevant information processing including guidance laws, state vector estimators, and autopilots. RWG performs digital modeling and simulation, synthetic scene generation, laboratory, field, and captive flight tests of seeker concepts and conventional guidance and control concepts. RWG also operates and maintains a hardware-in-the-loop closed loop guidance evaluation facility with synthetic scene generation and digital modeling and simulation capability, a radio-frequency measurement laboratory, a laser radar facility, an advanced navigation laboratory, and an electro-optics laboratory. RWG consists of the Integration Guidance Simulation Branch (RWGG), Integration Sensing &amp; Processing Sciences Branch (RWGI), Weapons Dynamics &amp; Controls Branch (RWGN), and the Weapons Seeker Sciences Branch (RWGS.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ORDNANCE DIVISION (RWM)<br /></span></strong>The Ordnance Division (RWM) directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development research of fuzes, damage mechanisms, and energetic materials for air launched munitions for use with a full array of launch platforms including fighter, bomber, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aircraft. RWM consists of the Energetic Materials Branch (RWME), Fuzes Branch (RWMF), Damage Mechanisms Branch (RWMW), and Ordnance Integration Branch (RWMI). RWME operates the High Explosives R&amp;D (HERD) facility which is responsible for the development of energetic materials from concept formulation through pilot plant production for transition into existing or future inventory weapon systems. RWMF is responsible for the research and development of technologies to enable precision burst point control initiation of current and future weapon systems. Examples of precision burst point control include post-impact hard target intelligent fuzing and high-closing rate air-to-air and air-to-ground target imaging and aim point selection. RWMW interests range from fundamental understanding of detonation wave implications for damage mechanism formation (i.e., explosively formed penetrators, stretch long rod penetrators, directed fragments) to shaped charge liner materials processing in the Focused Energy Warheads arena that is striving to reduce warhead size and increase lethality and adaptability for application to surface mobile targets and fixed targets. These interests range from fundamental understanding of material behavior in high rate, high-pressure processes (i.e., strain, erosion, toughness), to enhancement of existing blast/fragment warheads, to R&amp;D of novel kill mechanisms for fixed surface targets, both soft and hardened, in the Unitary Warheads arena. RWMI is responsible for conducting the ordnance level studies to establish the development trade space for the fuze, energetic materials and damage mechanism technologies. RWMI is also responsible for defining the interfaces between these technologies, and integrating and demonstrating various levels of ordnance packages prior to higher level weapon system integration and/or transition.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ASSESSMENT DIVISION (RWP)<br /></span></strong>The Strategic Planning and Assessment Division (RWP) is responsible for strategic planning and assessment of lethality, effectiveness, utility of weapon technologies, and evaluation of expected weapon performance by simulation. Strategic planning consists of overall RW investment planning; determining warfighter issues and requirements related to munitions and the transition opportunities for science and technology, and managing the cooperative research, technology transfer, and SBIR programs. RWP directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile modeling and simulation, basic physics and computational modeling. RWP consists of the Capability Planning Branch (RWPB), the Computational Mechanics Branch (RWPC), and the Lethality and Vulnerability Branch (RWPL).</p>
<p>The descriptions of the technical areas are organized by scientific discipline, and the reader may note some overlap between sections. The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the sixteen prospective research areas. These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit truly creative proposals that have the potential to dramatically shift existing air delivered munitions paradigms. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Directorate focal points associated with these technology areas. However, any submitted white paper or proposal must be grounded in achievable technology goals.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 1 - WEAPON AERIAL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH (RWAV)</strong></p>
<p>Advances in weapon aerial systems technologies are required to take advantage of emerging developments in weapon guidance systems, networked information systems, and precision effect ordnance systems. The goal of this work is to perform weapon aerial systems technology research for development of agile weapon airframes capable of delivering precision controlled effects against fixed and mobile ground targets and air targets. Research areas of interest include: agile weapon airframe design for all flight regimes; precision weapon subsystems integration; miniature weapon design, carriage, and dispensing technology; weapon control and actuation system technology; compact power and actuation for miniature weapons; unmanned combat air vehicle weapon integration/dispensing; and compressed carriage munitions design. Airframe technology research approaches should build upon advances in dynamic systems, aerodynamics, structural dynamics, materials, propulsion, and flight dynamics theories and methodologies; should exploit advances in other weapon technologies (e.g., advanced sensors and seekers, guidance and control algorithms, network information architectures, controlled effect ordnance, etc.); should be amenable to further development through sound principles of systems engineering; and should offer the potential for significantly improving affordable weapon aerial systems capabilities and reliabilities.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">Technical POC: Johnny Evers<br />AFRL/RWAV<br />(850) 883-1887<br />Fax: (850) 883-2538<br /><a href="mailto:johnny.evers@eglin.af.mil">johnny.evers@eglin.af.mil</a><br /><br /><br /><strong>RESEARCH AREA 2 - BIOMIMETIC SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL (RWGI)</strong></p>
<p>Both biological systems and smart munitions are required to collect space, time, and color information from the environment, process it, and make some decision. The decision may be that of detecting, recognizing, tracking, or intercepting an object. The decision may also be that of changing position or direction of motion for vehicle navigation or for better viewing of a target. A clear understanding of how the natural systems collect and process information to make these kinds of decisions may lead to revolutionary seeker concepts for autonomous weapons, as well as other machine vision applications. Thus, RWGI is interested in signal processing and control methods that use natural concepts found in biological systems. Our focus in biomimetics (the science of mimicking biological systems) is on leveraging efforts previously aimed at understanding how life forms collect and process environmental information. We want to use what is understood about the natural seekers to build small and affordable autonomous munitions seekers. As biologically inspired seeker system concepts mature and exploit commercially available technology, the resemblance to the original biological system may diminish or even disappear. This consequence reflects our focus on building affordable, capable seekers for smart munitions. Proposed concepts should support the mission of the Munitions Directorate and Advanced Guidance Division.</p>

<p>RWGI is interested in investigating all aspects of Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) technology as it applies to seekers for conventional guided weapons. Interests range from basic signal/image processing foundations through tower and flight test of advanced real time ATR/host signal processor implementations. ATR systems (and related technologies) designed for use with all relevant weapon system sensors (MMW Radar, SAR, IIR, LADAR, Dual Mode combinations, etc.) are of interest.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 4 - HARDWARE-IN-THE-LOOP SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES (RWGG)</strong></p>
<p>RWGG is interested in developing advanced capabilities related to hardware-in-the-loop and digital simulation of guided weapon designs. RWGG exercises simulations to verify weapon performance, with particular emphasis on target acquisition, tracking, and guidance performance during terminal homing. Sensors and algorithms for Strategic and Theater Missile Defense concepts developed under the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Tactical Munitions subsystems developed within AFRL/RW are evaluated. Weapons tested typically include visible, imaging infrared, millimeter-wave, and/or LADAR seeker subsystems. Emphasis for simulation technology research is placed on advancement and improvements to scene projection/projector technologies, real-time target scene generation techniques, target phenomenology methods, simulation architectures, millimeter-wave simulators, cryogenic chamber simulator, wide field-of-view flight motion simulators, and high bandwidth motion simulators.</p>

<p>Integral to the development of advanced munitions programs is the capability at AFRL/RW to perform high fidelity simulation-based testing of munitions, components and systems. The current capability to generate synthetic imagery for high fidelity hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) and Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) algorithm testing is based on a toolbox of independent Government and industry tools for predicting threat characteristics, environmental effects, and munitions hardware and software performance. The evolution in complexity and capability of modern weapons systems, however, is leading to demands for higher fidelity and performance from test simulations. In addition, the integrated nature of the modern battlefield requires test simulations to encompass not only the weapon itself, but also a variety of other systems. New scene generation (SG) techniques are needed in the areas of characterization of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Air Force threats, urban environments, chemical/biological effects, coupling and integration of scene generation software, multiple sensor views, and advanced computing techniques. These SG improvements must be designed to streamline the process for evaluating guided munitions concepts from initial design to final implementation, lowering development costs and shortening time from drawing board to battlefield. The improved testing realism will provide confidence that the munitions will perform as expected under a much wider variety of combat conditions than previously possible.</p>

<p>RWG has an interest in developing the components and systems necessary for imaging and non-imaging laser radar systems. These include, but are not limited to, optical sources, detector systems, beam pointing and beam scanning systems, detection schemes, and discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems. Interests range from complete systems and devices to basic materials and components. These include the following: Optical Sources: Optical sources of various wavelengths from the visible to the mid-infrared (&lt; 5 microns) are desired. These devices may be diodes, diode or flashlamp-pumped solid-state lasers, or optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). The systems can operate at moderate output powers at pulse repetition rates ranging from a few Hz to greater than 1 MHz. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, novel laser and OPO operating schemes, laser and OPO systems and designs, optical coatings, laser materials, and non-linear materials. Associated technologies, such as diode drive electronics, output power control and stabilization, wavelength tuning and stabilization techniques, rapid pulse generation, optical shutters and Q switches, polarization and phase controllers, and optical coupling techniques are also of interest. Detector systems: Single element and array detectors sensitive in the visible to mid-infrared wavelength range are desired. Rapid rise times (approaching a nanosecond) are desired, as is operability without cryogenic cooling. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, detector systems, detector materials, amplification and biasing electronics, temperature control systems, wavelength selection (filters, gratings, etc.), and readout technologies (for array detectors). Beam pointing and beam scanning systems: Systems that can rapidly steer a laser beam as well as the field of view of the detector are desired.

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 7 - NAVIGATION AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (RWGN)</strong></p>
<p>RWGN is developing global positioning system (GPS) anti-jam technology, geo-referenced alternative to GPS navigation, control algorithms for agile autonomous micro air vehicles and micro munitions, vision-based guidance methodologies, control algorithms for path planning and task assignment of cooperative systems of munitions and air vehicles, track fusion and on-line state estimation methods for fusing target tracks between weapon platforms, methodologies for operators to supervise the time critical control of collections of cooperating air vehicles, small and low cost components for secure low probability of intercept data links on micro weapons, and network topologies and routing algorithms for small to large networks of munitions with line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight links. GPS technologies of interest are anti-jam techniques including spatial (beam forming and/or null steering) and temporal anti-jam technologies, and miniature GPS antenna technologies. Biologically inspired but mathematically rigorous techniques are being pursued for agile and vision-based guidance and control. Cooperative control methodologies currently emphasize integrated path planning and task assignment, hedging for un-modeled (adversarial induced) uncertainty, and information theoretic bounds on performance of cooperative networks. Data link technologies are needed that will yield extreme miniaturization while being compatible with current and future military tactical networks.</p>

<p><br /><strong>RESEARCH AREA 8 - MODELING, SIMULATION, &amp; ANALYSIS (MS&amp;A) OF ADVANCED WEAPON CONCEPTS (RWPL)</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to develop/modify and employ models used to analyze advanced weapon concepts and their related concepts of employment to highlight technologies worthy of consideration for investment. The objective is to apply, modify and/or combine engineering, engagement (one-on-one), mission (few-on-few), systems-of-systems, campaign (many-on-many, military worth), level modeling techniques, tools, and analysis methods as well as virtual and constructive digital simulation which lend themselves to the quick and effective evaluation of advanced weapon concepts. Concepts include, but are not limited to, intercommunicative weapons, novel damage mechanisms, lethal and non-lethal destruct mechanisms, multiple targeting, and time critical delivery. Detailed modeling includes, but is not limited to, sensors, aerodynamics, autopilots, navigation and guidance schemes, propulsion, warheads, fuzes, datalinks, error filters, environment (wind, fog, dust), lethality, vulnerability, and threats. Scenario development and visualization at each level of MS&amp;A is also sought. Research into new simulation toolsets and architectures designed for this purpose will also be considered.

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 9 - TARGET VULNERABILITY AND WEAPON EFFECTIVENESS (RWPL)</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to collect data, conduct research, develop/modify and employ responsive modeling tools, target models, and processes as part of AFRL's R&amp;D efforts. These efforts will identify potential vulnerabilities in targets and their subcomponents for conventional or concept weapons to exploit. They will also enable understanding and predictive capability for the effectiveness of inventory, developmental, and conceptual munitions when deployed against targets and critical components. Targets of interest can include but are not limited to mobile, fixed (above and below ground), hard and deeply buried, chem-bio and air-to-air. This research will allow development of new techniques or enhancement of existing techniques to measure and compare weapon effectiveness, collateral damage, and potential collateral hazards. Research will include improvements in our ability to predict and measure component vulnerability and functional defeat allowing assessment of weapon effects that degrade a target's ability to perform its intended functions without necessarily destroying it. It could also include research and modeling of new or conceptual damage mechanisms. Development of new target and associated functional models would improve our abilities to exploit high interest targets or newly discovered vulnerabilities. Research to enhance or develop methodology to account for the target critical equipment/components, and their interconnections, and associated failure logic and failure modes could be required. Tools of interest include, but are not limited to AJEM, ARM, BLASTX, BRL-CAD, Endgame Framework, FastCD, FASTGEN, FATEPEN, IMEA, JWS, MEVA, ORCA, PENCURV, PDAM, STEP, STMG, VALUE, WEAPS, and WinBLAST.

<p><br /><strong>RESEARCH AREA 10 - WEAPON/TARGET MECHANICS (RWPC)</strong></p>
<p>The performance assessment and development of advanced conventional weapon systems requires the capabilities to model complex weapon/target interaction phenomena and to predict environments produced by impacting, penetrating, and detonating warheads. Modeling may be achieved with simplified engineering models or system/subsystem analysis codes, but the emphasis of this effort is the development and validation of continuum mechanics codes yielding high fidelity weapon and target models. Areas of particular interest include penetration mechanics, high strain rate fracture dynamics and constitutive modeling, modeling the shock survivability of fuze<br />electronic components, predictive models for the change in material properties due to thermal cycling (energetics and electronics), fragmentation, mesoscale modeling (metals and energetics), localized shear band formation, high pressure/high strain rate modeling of geologic and geologically derived materials, modeling of reacting droplet and particulate flows, equation of state and constitutive models for chemical and biological agents, numerical modeling of neutralization mechanisms for biological and<br />chemical agents, hydrodynamic ram, atomization and aerosolization of chemical and biological agents, direct numerical simulation of detonations, coupled detonation physics and multi-phase flow, accurate and efficient boundary interface treatments, the ability to span several orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal length scales, and advanced numerical methods. Innovative theoretical, computational and experimental projects that specifically address the problems of interest and result in an improved predictive capability are the goal.</p>

<p>RWMW is interested in all aspects conventional munitions warhead technology as it relates to the destruction, damage, defeat, or denial of function. Technologies and concepts are sought for a robust and affordable capability of air-launched munitions in the areas of: hard and deeply buried targets, fixed ground targets, mobile ground vehicles, air dominance, chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear/explosive (CBRNE) neutralization or access denial, and cybernet neutralization. Additionally, there is interest in specialized diagnostics, techniques, and experimental methods for the development and validation of these capabilities. Technical interests within the Hard Target Effects technical competency are in penetration mechanics, materials for surviving high speed penetration of geologic and cementitious materials, abrasion resistance, terradynamic stability, innovative case structures and composites, and production methods. Fundamental science studies in high rate particulate flow and meso-scale modeling is an area of emphasis. The Damage Mechanisms Science technical competency has interests in miniature and micro warheads, multifunctional energetic materials and damage mechanisms, directional control and focused effects, selectable effects, and collateral damage control. Approaches in all of these areas are not to be limited to traditional nor classical blast-fragmentation effects. Novel concepts of target defeat are encouraged to augment or replace the more traditional kinetic energy methods.</p>

<p><br /><strong>RESEARCH AREA 12 - FUZE RESEARCH (RWMF)<br /></strong>RWMF develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies that have application to fuzes for air-delivered weapons, including, but not limited to, guided and unguided bombs, missiles, and submunitions. Fuzes must reliably remain in a safe mode until the appropriate post-deployment environments (such as freefall) are sensed; the fuze must then arm the weapon and, upon receiving a signal from a target detection device (TDD), initiate the explosive fill (or other damage mechanism). RWMF thus seeks proposals for innovative technologies that can be integrated into the design or testing of air-delivered weapon fuzes.<br />RWMF is particularly interested in fuzes (including submunition fuzes) and related technologies that are capable of surviving the repetitive, multi-axis shock environment experienced by a fuze during penetration of a hardened target and functioning the warhead through cockpit-selectable time delay functions and advanced post-impact environmental sensing. However, current test technologies do not fully duplicate the multi-axial fuze environment in terms of duration, repetitive high-acceleration loading, and other aspects of the mechanical loading profile. This necessitates extremely expensive sled tests for fuze research, testing, qualification, and performance evaluation. Therefore, a need exists for laboratory and field test techniques and equipment to duplicate these repetitive, multi-axial shocks.<br />Some additional penetration fuzing-specific research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />- Develop a jam-resistant, greater than 250 kilobits/second shock-hardened wireless Data Link for two-way communication with a fuze during a weapon's deep underground penetration event;<br />- Investigate methods/techniques for improving the shock survivability of inventory hardened fuzes (FMU-143, FMU-152) used in penetrating weapons; e.g., techniques for eliminating gaps/air voids between the fuze and fuzewell;<br />- Develop a hardened, passive, unpowered, tri-axial device that irreversibly and measurably changes some physical configuration or property without relaxation/hysteresis to record the peak acceleration as a back-up data point for tests when a hardened fuze data recorder fails;<br />- Develop a low-cost (&lt;$100), shock-hardened accelerometer;<br />- Develop non-inertial techniques and appropriate devices for detecting voids and layers during hard target penetration; and<br />- Develop a miniature passive or active sensor capable of identifying case breakup and/or severe trajectory instability during a hardened penetration event for the purpose of salvaging the fuze function and high explosive detonation-this technology must operate inside an existing fuze well as an add-on to existing fuze components and have low false alarm rate.</p>
<p>RWMF is also interested in improved sensors, techniques, and/or systems for second safety environment sensing for gravity released general-purpose bombs. For example, an improvement or replacement for the FZU-32, -48, etc., would be of significant interest. <br />In the area of miniature and micro-munition fuzing, research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />- Reliable miniature three port air valve that has a wide temperature operating range (-55 to +75 degree C) <br />- Ground profiling fuze sensor technology<br />- Active imaging aimpoint selecting fuze sensor technology<br />The final area of focused interest is in the area of in-line and out-of-line initiation systems. RWMF Initiation Science and Technology group is interested in novel ignition devices or ignition circuitry that can enhance reliability while reducing energy budgets for initiation systems. Additionally, concepts that would enable novel warhead designs are of interest. We are also interested in novel or more inherently robust manufacturing processes that can be applied to components within initiation systems. Finally, there is interest in methods or techniques for characterizing performance of those systems.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 14 - FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT ENABLING MICRO MUNITIONS AND ADVANCED ENERGETICS (RWME)</strong></p>
<p>AFRL/RW anticipates a need for new, improved, and often unique facilities and equipment to support expanding future in-house RDT&amp;E (research, development, test, and evaluation) work especially in the areas of micro munitions and advanced energetic. This work will require facilities with the capability to work with energetic nano materials that may also be classified as an explosive. These new RW facilities and equipment will enable world class research, development, integration, fabrication and testing of future prototype munitions system concepts demonstrating emerging micro munition and advanced energetics technologies. Developing concepts and preliminary designs for these new and unique facilities as well as for much of the new equipment to be used in these facilities will need to be approached as research and development projects, not as just design projects. New control/monitoring techniques and equipment will be required to simultaneously meet HVAC requirements for working with nano materials that are also an explosive especially in areas where a clean room environment is required. Of particular interest are proposals for preliminary feasibility studies; concept development, assessment, evaluation, preliminary design and associated cost estimates/presentation material for the new facilities and/or new research equipment that will be required to pursue this evolution of energetics from conventional explosives to reactive materials and nano energetics and munitions from the current conventional munitions to micro munitions. Also of interest are proposals for structural response calculations/modeling, design analysis, and design needed to support Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) submittals/presentations required for explosives siting approval of new facilities to be located at one of RW's remote explosives locations. This topic includes work to advance the understanding of nano energetic material effects on both the human body and the environment as well as work relating to the understanding, interpretation, and assessment of present and likely future applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements/regulations that would relate to nano energetics. A need is anticipated for developing new systems/components that will enable the new facilities and equipment to meet these emerging future requirements/regulations.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 15 - Multi-function Multi-mode RADAR RESEARCH (RWGS)</strong></p>
<p>RWG has an interest in developing innovative multifunction radar systems that lend themselves to a variety of applications for both munitions and Combat UAV's. There is a need for generating multi mode seeker systems where RF is one of the modes that can provide the weather capability and be amalgamated innovatively with IR, EO or Ladar modes in order to provide improved ATR and aim point selection to the munitions seeker system. There is also the interest of creating small munitions seeker and sensor technologies that would provide low cost solutions for creating submunitions seekers. These seekers are to be integrated into a 20 pound munitions full-up-round, for creating smart guided submunitions that can be incorporated into a larger cluster munition for dispensing in a target rich environment. These submunitions require weather capability, and innovative miniature RF solutions are of great interest. There is also interest in developing a Noise/ LPI radar seeker that can provide the capability of not being detected. These seekers must provide the function of detecting, acquiring, tracking, and engaging targets with a very small probability of being detected. The interest also extends to hypersonic and high speed environments. The high speed environment provides interesting requirements that provide great opportunities for innovations in materials implementation, apertures, component technologies and processing. RWG is also interested in dome technology and dome materials for these high speed applications. Concepts and innovative ideas for solutions to these different seeker applications are also of interest. The various seeker applications listed above have many implications of RF components, aperture technology ( conformal, broadband, electronically steered, mechanically steered, concentric apertures), real time processing, miniaturization of subsystems, etc. Signal processing techniques for these various seeker technology described, and the ability to detect, track, and engage targets is of interest. The seeker systems listed above are also expected to provide good measurements for the purpose of guiding the munitions, or CUAC to the intended target. Along with this is the ability to provide measurements or information for the use of classifying the target once reacquired. Another interest is in the seeker system being able to provide fuzing information that would lend itself for an innovative approach for Guidance integrated Fuzing (GIF) applications.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 16 - REVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH (RW)</strong></p>
<p>This research area is intended to cover, in general nature, all revolutionary research areas of interest to this Directorate. AFRL/RW is interested in revolutionary munitions-related research that has the potential to create new<br />airframe, ordnance, and guidance and control technology weapon paradigms. One of the goals of this program is to develop highly innovative solutions relating to munitions ordnance packages and airframe technology for the purpose of defeating a variety of targets including fixed and moving targets, hard and soft targets, and above ground and deeply buried targets. Ideas and concepts are sought that represent new approaches - lethal and non-lethal - to defeat these targets. With this type of revolutionary thinking, as opposed to evolutionary, order of magnitude increases in performance may be realized.</p>
<p>The military payoff would be in terms of significant munitions weight and size<br />reduction, reduced weapon cost, and improved effectiveness. Non-lethal<br />approaches also have the benefit of disabling enemy capabilities with reduced<br />loss of life.</p>
<p>Another goal of this research area is to develop highly innovative concepts and<br />approaches in guidance and control technologies for air-deliverable autonomous munitions. This program may develop advanced concepts in such areas as electro-optical, infrared, millimeter wave, and radio frequency seeker technology with the components and signal/image processing systems used in such seekers. Advanced concepts in the guidance, navigation and control (GN&amp;C) of munitions airframes will also be sought. The basic seeker&nbsp; technologies to be considered include: sensing materials, sensing elements for target characterization, autonomous target acquisition algorithms, signal and image processing algorithms, and multi-sensor data fusion algorithms. The basic GN&amp;C technologies include: miniature inertial measurement units (IMUs), Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, jam resistant GPS, and micro-electro-mechanical system based sensing and control cooperative attack algorithms. In addition to advancements in the basic technology, revolutionary<br />changes that shift current or create new guidance and control paradigms will be<br />developed.</p>

Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Additionally for formal proposals, proposal risk for schedule will be evaluated. This relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror's proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance.</p>
<p>Individual white papers will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers submitted under this BAA. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>It is the policy of AFRL/RW to treat all white papers as privileged information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. White papers will be subject to an evaluation by highly qualified Government scientists. The offeror must appropriately indicate any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the white paper (see also paragraph IV.B. above). Should white papers be selected and full proposals requested, the proposal is subject to incorporation into a resulting contract and is therefore releasable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) unless specifically exempt or portions of the proposal are exempt under FOIA .</p>
<p><strong>B. Review and Selection Process</strong>: The evaluation described above will generally result in white papers being placed in one of the three categories below:</p>
<p><strong>1. Category I</strong>: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the AFRL/RW technology research areas, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.<br /><br /><strong>2. Category II</strong>: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p><strong>3. Category III:</strong> Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Award Notices (White Papers):</strong> Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the Contracting Officer. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting offeror will be awarded a contract. Offerors of those white papers not selected for further consideration will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>Offerors may request status of their white paper no earlier than 45 calendar days after submission.</p>
<p><strong>B. Award Notices (full proposals):</strong> Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award after evaluation of the proposal. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.</p>
<p><strong>C. Administrative and National Policy Requirements:</strong> Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a classified facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to information at the equivalent level of security at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p><strong>D. Reporting:</strong> Contractors should expect any contract or assistance instrument resulting from this BAA would contain the requirement to provide various types of periodic and final technical reports, and possibly cost and other reports.</p>
<p><strong>E. Data Rights Assertions:</strong> It is anticipated that all data delivered under any resulting award will be delivered with unlimited rights; however different rights may be negotiated as appropriate. The contractor shall identify data rights assertions, licenses, patents, etc. that apply to any proprietary materials, technical data, products, software, or processes to be used by the prime or subcontractor(s) in the performance of this program; and shall address acquisition of data rights or licenses, or expected recoupment of development costs for those proprietary items that will be integral to any contracts awarded under this BAA. Any data delivered or anticipated to be delivered with less than unlimited rights must be reported in a separate, appropriately marked appendix to the final report of any awarded contract resulting from this BAA.</p>
<p><strong>F. Occupational Safety and health (OSHA) and Voluntary Protection Program (VPP):</strong> Eglin AFB is in the process of pursuing recognition under the OSHA VPP. If required as a part of a resulting contract from this BAA, AFFARS Clause 5352.223-9001 mandates that adequate health and safety requirements be identified in the contract.</p>

<p><strong>VIII. OTHER INFORMATION PERTINENT TO AWARD OF CONTRACTS AND/OR ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Support Contractors:</strong> Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The AFRL Munitions Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: <br />1. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files;<br />2. Accessing library files for use by Government personnel; and<br />3. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.<br />Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><strong>B. Communication:</strong> Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of proposals. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p><strong>C. Debriefings:</strong> Contractors whose white papers or proposals are not selected for further consideration/award, may request a debriefing. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016).</p>
<p><strong>D. Wide Area Work Flow Notice:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. The clause cites three possible electronic formats through which to submit electronic payment requests. Effective 1 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.</p>
<p><strong>E. Item Identification and Valuation:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Aug 2008) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the Government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the Government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the Government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the Government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee.). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/sitemap.html .</p>
<p><strong>F. Forward Pricing Rate Agreements:</strong> If formal proposals are requested, offerors who have Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (FPRAs) and Forward Pricing Rate Recommendations (FPRRs) should submit them with their proposals.</p>
<p><strong>G. Pre-Award Clearance:</strong> Pursuant to FAR 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Program's (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Preaward Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward. This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past 2 years with the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a pre-award clearance from the OFCCP.</p>
<p><strong>H. Excessive Pass-Through Charges:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.215-7004, Excessive Pass-Through Charges, (May 2008) which requires the contractor to identify in its proposal the percentage of effort to be performed by the prime contractor and the percentage expected to be performed by each subcontractor. If the contractor intends to subcontract more than 70% of the total cost of work under the contract or task order, then it shall identify the amount of the contractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the contractor. If any subcontractor intends to subcontract to a lower tier subcontractor more than 70% of the total cost of its work, then it shall identify the amount of the subcontractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the lower tier subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the subcontractor. <br /><br /><strong>I. Associate Contractor Agreements:</strong> Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on Government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The Contracting Officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate Government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects. Prime contractor to subcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs. For each award, the Contracting Officer will identify associate contractors with whom agreements are required.</p>
<p><strong>J. Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation:</strong> As prescribed in FAR 19.308, FAR Clause 52.219-28, "Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation (Apr 2009)," is incorporated by reference in this solicitation. This clause will be contained in any contracts resulting from this solicitation. This clause requires a contractor to rerepresent its size status when certain conditions apply. The clause provides detail on when the rerepresentation must be complete and what the contractor must do when a rerepresentation is required. <br /><br /><strong>K. Enabling Clause:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain a special clause entitled "Enabling Clause between Prime Contractors and Service Contractors", in Section I when a prime contractor must agree to cooperate with a support contractor during the performance of this contract.</p>

<p><strong>1. BACKGROUND - BATTLEFIELD AIRMEN</strong></p>
<p>Certain ground combat capabilities are an Airman's responsibility and require unique surface operations that are integral to the application of air and space power. To meet this responsibility, the Air Force recognized the need to organize, train, and equip a force of Battlefield Airmen (BA) capable of delivering distinctive expertise in a ground combat environment with unequaled firepower, accuracy, responsiveness, flexibility and persistence. These BA include Combat Control, Pararescue, Tactical Air Control and Battlefield Weather professionals. BA provide skill sets not commonly found across the Air Force and typically operate in combat zones outside the perimeter of Air Force bases, often in the deep battle space.</p>
<p>Each of these career fields has unique missions in support of both Special Operations Forces and conventional forces. However, many core disciplines are common to the majority of BA. These commonalities include areas such as methods of employment, mobility, force protection methods, communication, and advances in mission planning and rehearsal. Advancements are sought to support specific mission areas as they pertain to each individual career field. To better understand the needs of each BA expertise, a short summary of each career field's mission is provided below.<br />The Air Force Combat Controllers are Special Tactics ground operators who work as members of Air Force Special Tactics Teams and as members of Army Special Forces, Navy SEAL, and Joint Special Operations teams. Combat Controllers are certified to act as air traffic controllers and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers in hostile and dangerous environments. They can be deployed by sea, air, and land to take over or construct an airstrip, set up navigational equipment, and direct airplanes and helicopters to a safe landing without the use of a tower or elaborate communications system. They also establish drop zones and control parachute drops of personnel and equipment, and control airstrikes and air attacks from fixed and rotary-wing aircraft from all military services.</p>
<p>Pararescue Airmen, known as PJs, conduct conventional or unconventional rescue operations. These PJs are the ideal force for personnel recovery and combat search and rescue. PJs' primarily function as personnel recovery specialists with emergency medical capabilities in humanitarian and combat environments. They deploy in any available manner, to include air-land-sea tactics, into restricted environments to authenticate, extract, treat, stabilize and evacuate injured personnel, while acting in an enemy-evading recovery role. PJs participate in search and rescue, combat search and rescue, recovery support for NASA and conduct other operations as appropriate. They are among the most highly trained emergency trauma specialists in the U.S. military, maintaining emergency medical technician-paramedic qualification throughout their careers. With this medical and rescue expertise, along with their deployment capabilities, PJs are able to perform life-saving missions in the world's most remote areas. <br /><br />Battlefield and Special Operations Weathermen are meteorologists with advanced tactical training to operate in hostile or denied territory. They gather and interpret weather data, and provide intelligence from deployed locations while working primarily with Army (Battlefield Weather) and Special Operations (Special Operations Weather) forces. They collect localized weather information, assist mission planning, and generate accurate, mission-tailored target and route forecasts in support of conventional and special operations. They deploy into restricted environments by air, land or sea to observe and analyze weather data. They also train joint force members to take and communicate limited weather observations. Additionally, Special Operations Weathermen conduct special reconnaissance, collect upper air data, organize, establish and maintain weather data reporting networks, determine host nation meteorological capabilities and train foreign national forces. <br /><br />Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) personnel advise U.S. Army conventional and special operations ground maneuver commanders on the integration and execution of air and space power. Qualified individuals, serving as Joint Terminal Attack Controllers, provide final attack control to aircrew when aircraft are inbound to the target, ensuring the aircrew identifies and attacks the correct target, minimizing the risk to friendly ground forces and preventing unwanted collateral damage. Operating on the forward edge of the battle area and behind enemy lines, TACPs coordinate with Theater Air Ground System elements through the use of state-of-the-art communications, and maintain proficiency in the tactics, techniques and procedures of their aligned Army units. When deployed, the TACPs live under austere field conditions, and coordinate, de-conflict, and execute air-to-ground missions within the Army's area of operation.</p>
<p>To continue to maintain superiority over our enemies, research and development to improve the effectiveness of Battlefield Airmen is vital. The Air Force Research Laboratory seeks to address capability gaps, limitations or deficiencies through this Broad Agency Announcement.</p>
<p><strong>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>This is a Broad Agency Announcement of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW), under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA, that are selected for award, are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>Tactical Capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces white papers may also be submitted for the acquisition of test assets. In the event these submissions are selected for award, they could be awarded under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2373, Acquisition for Experimental Test Purposes.</p>
<p>For purposes of this announcement, AFRL/RW intends to contract with private industry, non-profit organizations, and educational institutions for research in tactical capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces (BA and SF). Research includes scientific study and experimentation directed at developing technologies, components, and quick reaction capabilities (QRC). This work includes tactical level Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), threat intercept, and force application capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces. Potential areas of interest include tactical level targeting applications such as wireless network applications, line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight communication links, remote sensing, remote switching, target tagging, tactical command and control of ground forces, tactical electrical energy, small Unmanned Aerial Systems, and general improvements in situational awareness, targeting, force protection/fractricide prevention, and damage assessment Efforts proposed under this BAA should be designed to demonstrate well defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort; however, there is the possibility of analysis efforts to support experimental testing or to support other demonstrations proposed under this BAA.</p>
<p>These basic and applied research effort results could include deliverables with provisions for future prototyping, field demonstrations and warfighter evaluation. Prototypes may be a deliverable but only as may be necessary to evaluate the basic or applied research efforts in a meaningful manner. Under some circumstances, we expect that narrowly focused white papers or proposals for advanced research may be required during the time of this open announcement. Under those circumstances, a specific or special BAA amendment may be issued describing the requirement in greater detail, defining funding available, elaborating on white paper or proposal submission due date and format, and possibly providing more specific evaluation criteria.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>PROSPECTIVE RESEARCH AREAS</strong></p>
<p>The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the prospective research areas mentioned in the Program Description. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Technical Directorate focal points associated with these nine technology focus areas. Proposed efforts under this BAA must be in the realm of basic or applied research. Hardware development that is unrelated to a specific weapon system and not intended directly for the Air Force inventory may qualify if it falls into a category often called "breadboards/brassboards" or exploratory development models. Development of prototype hardware may be pursued under a BAA; however, such development must be for the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of a technology or solution. It should not be for the purpose of acquiring specific hardware that has already been defined or developed by the Government.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 1 - FORCE PROTECTION ENHANCEMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research in the areas of force protection to enhance the safety, survivability and capabilities of the deployed battlefield airman. The objective is to conduct research which could eventually lead to the development of improved shelters, materials, armor and related items for the deployed Battlefield Airmen. Research to effectively detect, deceive, avoid and prevent contamination and/or injury or exposure to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) and other threats will greatly enhance BA effectiveness. Research in areas that will allow the Battlefield Airmen to engage threats from greater standoff distances is also desired. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List (may not be all inclusive): 0069, 0070, 0071, 0119, 0153, 0272, 0393, 399 and 0409.

<p><strong>V. WHITE PAPER/ PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Criteria:</strong> The following five criteria, listed in descending order of importance, and an assessment of risk, will be used to determine whether full proposals will be invited based on the white paper submitted. The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. These criteria will also be used to evaluate formal proposals, should they be requested. <br /><br /><strong>1. Evaluation Criteria:<br /><br /></strong>a. An integrated assessment of the proposed approach to include scientific and/or technical merits, associated risks, and the potential contributions of the effort to meet/fulfill Battlefield Air Operations Kit (Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces) mission requirements. Potential value to the government (technical promise) will be assessed, based on innovation (originality and feasibility), transitionability, and desirability to the warfighter.<br /><br />b. The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives.</p>
<p>c. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives.</p>
<p>d. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror, if any, and the availability of funds (i.e., considering budgets and funding).</p>
<p>e. The extent to which the proposal supports government field testing when applicable.</p>
<p><strong>2. Proposal Risk Assessment:</strong> Proposal risk for technical, cost, schedule, and other will be assessed as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff.</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used. Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>It is the policy of AFRL/RW to treat all white papers and proposals as privileged information, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Those selected as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation by highly qualified Government scientists. The offeror must appropriately indicate any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the white paper or proposal (see also paragraph IV.B. above). Should portions of a proposal be incorporated into a resulting contract, that portion may be subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act unless exempt from release.</p>
<p><strong>B. Review and Selection Process:</strong> The evaluation described above will generally result in white papers being placed in one of the three Categories below:</p>
<p><strong>1. Category I:</strong> Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.<br /><br /><strong>2. Category II:</strong> Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p><strong>3. Category III:</strong> Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Award Notices (White Papers):</strong> Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the Contracting Office. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting offeror will be awarded a contract. Offerors of those white papers not selected for further consideration will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>Offerors may request status of their white paper no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p><strong>B. Award Notices (full proposals):</strong> Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award after evaluation of the proposal. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.</p>
<p><strong>C. Administrative and National Policy Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a classified facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to information at the equivalent level of security at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.

<p><strong>VIII. OTHER INFORMATION PERTINENT TO AWARD OF CONTRACTS AND/OR ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Support Contractors:</strong> Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The AFRL Munitions Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: <br />1. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files;<br />2. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and<br />3. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.<br />Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><strong>B. Communication:</strong> Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of proposals. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p><strong>C. Debriefings:</strong> When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016).</p>
<p><strong>D. Wide Area Work Flow Notice:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. The clause cites three possible electronic formats through which to submit electronic payment requests. Effective 01 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to Universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.</p>
<p><strong>E. Item Identification and Valuation:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Aug 2008) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/sitemap.html .</p>

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p>52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.<br />Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number;</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>
<p>(5) Terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>
<p>(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);</p>
<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>
<p>(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.

If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform.

The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br><br>See Addendum Below<br><br> (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br>(End of provision)<br><br>ADDENDUM TO FAR Clause 52.212-2.  The following addendum is included and hereby made part of FAR Clause 52.212-2.<br><br>(a)  Basis for Award<br><br>     1.  The government will award a contract to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government considering price and technical factors stated in this RFP.  Failure to propose a price for all CLINs will render the proposal unacceptable and the proposal will be rejected.<br><br>     2.  Evaluation factors upon which award will be based, are set forth below.<br><br>(b)  Evaluation Approach<br><br>     1.  The Government will evaluate each proposal by employing the lowest price technically acceptable method.  The written proposal, in conjunction with the on-site evaluation, will be used to assess evaluation factor ratings.<br><br>     2.  All proposals will be subjected to an initial screening by the Contracting Officer to determine whether proposals are complete before being evaluated as detailed below.  Proposals that are considered substantively incomplete after initial screening shall be rejected and offerors will be notified they are no longer eligible for further consideration.  Offerors are advised that unsupported promises to comply with contractual requirements will not be sufficient.  Additionally, a proposal that is unreasonable or incomplete in terms of price will not be considered for award.<br><br>     3.  The Government intends to award without discussions.  Offerors shall ensure their initial proposal contains its best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to hold discussions if necessary.  Discussions, if any, will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.306 and final offers will be evaluated in the same manner and against the same criteria as were initial offers.<br><br>(c)  Evaluation Factors for Award.  Proposals submitted in response to the solicitation will be evaluated based upon the following factors:  Price, Past performance, and Mission Capability.  The Mission Capability and Past Performance factors are equal in importance and when combined are less important than the Price factor.  <br><br>1.  Mission Capability.  Under Mission Capability the following elements will be evaluated: Expert knowledge of JEFTS/ECS2 systems and the timeline for completion of tasks 1-7.  These elements will be evaluated together for acceptability in the Mission Capability area.  The Mission Capability factor will receive one of the following adjectival ratings:<br><br>	ACCEPTABLE  -  Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation (See Note below).<br><br>	UNACCEPTABLE  - Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br><br>NOTE:  Expert knowledge of JFETS/ECS2 systems will be a key factor in the selection consideration process. A proposal receiving an Unacceptable rating in this area will NOT be eligible for award.<br><br>	2.  Past Performance. Under Past Performance the following elements will be evaluated:  Experience working in JFETS/ECS2 environment.  The Past Performance Factor will receive one of the adjectival ratings:<br><br>ACCEPTABLE  -  Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown (See Note below). <br><br>	UNACCEPTABLE  - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br><br>NOTE:  No record of past performance will result in an acceptable rating.  Offerors shall submit only past performance relevant to the requirements set forth in this solicitation.  A proposal receiving an Unacceptable rating in this area will NOT be eligible for award.		<br><br>	3.  Price.  Price will be evaluated for reasonableness IAW FAR 15.403-1(c)(1).  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal offers the lowest price, technically acceptable proposal.<br><br>52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT.

<DESC>This notice is being amended to change the notice type from combined synopsis/solicitation to Pre-Solicitation Notice.&nbsp; The solicitation uploaded with the original notice is deleted.<br /><br />NOAA's Office of Coast Survey (OCS) requires an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) capable of collecting swath bathymetric data in conformance with NOAA standards for nautical charting data. <br />
<p>The Coast Survey AUV project has successfully demonstrated the use of an AUV equipped with side scan sonar to conduct operational surveys to detect submerged obstructions and hazards to navigation. Coast Survey now requires a Bathymetric Mapping AUV to evaluate the operational effectiveness and data quality to determine if depth soundings collected by an AUV can meet nautical charting standards and NOAA survey requirements.</p>
<p>The Bathymetric Mapping AUV will be initially operated as a test and evaluation system aboard NOAA survey vessels, and, once standard operating procedures are established and the data validated to conform to standards it will be used aboard NOAA vessels for operational bathymetric mapping surveys in support of nautical charting. In both cases the AUV will be used in a similar fashion to the manned shipboard launches, which are deployed from the survey ship for 8-10 hours per day to perform bathymetric surveys within a short transit of the ship. The survey launches are then recovered nightly and the acquired data is transferred to shipboard computers for processing.</p>

<p>(vi) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999), and Addenda apply to this acquisition as follows: <br />(a)The Government will award an order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible firm whose quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations: (1) Technical Capability; (2) Price; and (3) Present and Past Performance.<br />(b)Basis for Award. Government evaluation objective is to award to the responsive firm whose quotation is technically acceptable and will provide the best value to the Government.<br />Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are approximatley equal in importance to price.<br />This evaluation process may result in an award to other than the low quotation.<br />1. Technical Capability. The Government shall evaluate the technical quotation on an Acceptable or Unacceptable basis as follows: Verifying that all required documentation listed in the Addenda to 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors for Part I technical information has been submitted by each firm. This factor is met when documentation from the firm demonstrates either direct experience or ability to obtain personnel with experience in performing the services as outlined in the Performance Work Statement attached hereto. Quotes incomplete shall receive an "unacceptable" rating and shall receive no further consideration for award of the order. <br />2. Price. Quotations rated technically acceptable shall then be ranked by price (See also paragraph (c) below). The prices will be evaluated for realism, and reasonableness. If the lowest price technical acceptable quotation is rated to have a Substantial Confidence performance assessment, that quotation represents the best value for the Government, the evaluation process stops at this point, and award is made.<br />If no firms are rated substantial confidence, we will then proceed to lowest price, satisfactory confidence, next to lowest price, unknown confidence, then to lowest price, limited confidence, lastly, lowest price, no confidence. <br />a. Realism: For prices to be realistic, the overall price in a Firm's quotation must:<br />(1) be realistic for the type of work to be performed<br />(2) reflect a clear understanding of the requirements<br />(3) Reflect what it would cost to perform operating with reasonable economy and efficiency.<br />b. Reasonableness: Reasonable prices are those that, considering the type of business concern and organizational structure, reflect market conditions for the requested work and reasonable to both parties.<br />3. Past Performance. The firm's performance will be assessed, specifically the quality and satisfaction rating for relevant contractual commitments on going or completed within the past five (5) years based on replies received from the past performance questionnaires and information obtained or available to this office, other Government offices or other private sources. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving services that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity that the effort described in this solicitation. In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFQ. Firms with no relevant past or present performance history or the firm's performance record is so limited, shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence" meaning the rating is treated neither favorable nor unfavorably. Past performance information will be evaluated only for technical acceptable quotations and from the lowest to the highest affordable priced quotes. <br />(c) Options. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a quotation is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(d) The Government intends to award an order without discussions with respective firms. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.<br />(e) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quotation mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the quotation, shall result in a binding order without further action by either party. Before the firm's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quotation (or part of a quotation), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (end of clause)</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION<br />SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE The Government has high expectation that the firm will <br />perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE The Government has an expectation that the firmwill <br />successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the firm's <br />performance record is so sparse that no confidence <br />assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>

<DESC><p>Introduction</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>The information from this market research will help the DMID, NIAID, NIH, and DHHS, plan their acquisition strategy. Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research for the investigation, control and prevention of diseases caused by all infectious agents other than HIV. Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DMID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new vaccines and biologics against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a coordinated evaluation and testing services program to provide preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical testing support for multiple vaccine and biologic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. The suite of testing services will encompass those activities commonly associated with the testing of vaccine and biologic products for infectious disease required for Investigational New Drug (IND) application and/or Biologic License Application (BLA). Consequently, DMID recognizes that to obtain the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in this solicitation, individual organizations will likely need the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in this contract and each awarded Task Order.</p>
<p>DMID anticipates awarding a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract that provides a guaranteed minimum award to the organization or consortium that best meets the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements of this solicitation. Sample Task Orders are provided in the RFP solely to evaluate offeror responses and capabilities. Task Orders for specific tasks will be issued after award of the Basic Contract.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this solicitation is to establish a NIAID resource entitled "Evaluation and Testing Services (ETS) for Vaccines and Other Biologics for Infectious Diseases" that provides a suite of preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical testing services for vaccines and other biologic products. While the overall suite of testing services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of vaccine and biological product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway. These services are intended to help a wide variety of investigators in a broad number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I/II/III trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter Phase I/II/III trials.</p>
<p><br />Project Requirements</p>
<p>Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform the tasks below. The Contractor shall be prepared to develop a response to individual Task Orders as they are assigned and to specify the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key components of each Task Order.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide DMID with a broad and flexible range of proactive and developmentally-oriented capabilities to provide testing services to support preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical studies for promising products when such products emerge from investigator-initiated research studies or other sources identified by DMID Program staff. These testing capabilities support early feasibility through Phase III clinical studies to 1) provide the ability to combine, develop, test, evaluate and refine different evaluation and testing technologies from multiple developers; 2) create capacity for the evaluation and testing of candidate vaccines and other biologics for infectious diseases and/or related toxins; 3) increase the Federal Government's response to emerging disease threats; and 4) improve surge capabilities. The Contractor shall also provide appropriate documentation and support for pre-IND, IND, and BLA submissions. <br />Specific Task Orders will depend on the status of the candidate(s) as part of an overall product development plan and/or regulatory submission plan to the FDA. DMID will issue a Task Order Request for Proposal after determination of a specific need that is appropriate to the Statement of Work. The Contractor shall be prepared to develop a response in which the Contractor specifies the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key components of each Task Order and the associated costs. The needs, funding, product maturity and timelines of the product as specified in the Task Order establishes requirements for compliance with current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) [21 CFR Parts -11, -58, -210, -211, -600].</p>
<p>For the purposes of this contract, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<p>&bull; Vaccines - An antigenic preparation used to render an organism immune to an infectious disease by inducing or increasing immunity for prophylaxis and/or therapy. Vaccine products include but are not limited to synthetic peptides, recombinant proteins, nucleic acids, viral-like particles, vector-based vaccines, as well as live, modified, killed, and/or attenuated bacteria, viruses, and other organisms.</p>
<p>&bull; Vaccine Components - An antigen-enhancing substance (i.e. adjuvant) or a delivery system (i.e. needle free dermal patch) that is used during dose administration to enhance the immune response of a vaccine.</p>
<p>&bull; Other Biologics - Therapeutic preparation made from living organisms or the components of living organisms and are most likely regulated by CBER. Biologics include but are not limited to allergenics; antitoxins; blood and blood products; and cellular and gene therapy products. For the purposes of this contract, challenge material for non-clinical, preclinical, and clinical trials will also be included in the definition of biologics.</p>
<p><br />The services shall be directed at the following:</p>
<p>&bull; diseases caused by pathogens and toxins on the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Category A, B, and C Priority Pathogens list (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/Pages/CatA.aspx)<br />&bull; emerging and re emerging infectious diseases;<br />&bull; antimicrobial resistant and multi drug resistant infections;<br />&bull; other bacterial infections; <br />&bull; fungal infections; <br />&bull; viral infections excluding HIV; and<br />&bull; parasitic diseases.</p>

The Governmentâ€™s sources of information for evaluating safety may include, but are not limited to, OSHA, NAVFACâ€™s Facility Accident and Incident Reporting (FAIR) database, and other related databases.
 While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete safety information regarding these submittal requirements rests with the firm. The evaluation will collectively consider the following: 
- Experience Modification Rate (EMR) 
- OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate 
- Firm Technical Approach to Safety 
- Other sources of information available to the Government 
(1) Experience Modification Rate (EMR): 
The Government will evaluate the EMR to determine if the Offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices, taking into account any upward or downward trends and extenuating circumstances that impact the rating.
 Lower EMRs will be given greater weight in the evaluation. 
(2) OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate: 
The Government will evaluate the OSHA DART Rate to determine if the Offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices, taking into account any upward or downward trends and extenuating circumstances that impact the rates. Lower OSHA DART Rates will be given greater weight in the evaluation. 
(3) Technical Approach to Safety: 
The Government will evaluate the narrative to determine the degree to which subcontractor safety performance will be considered in the selection of all levels of subcontractors on the upcoming project. The Government will also evaluate the narrative to determine the degree to which innovations are being proposed that may enhance safety on this procurement.

<SUBJECT>9 FAM-e Visas
<SOLNBR>REF9FAM
<NTYPE>SRCSGT
<RESPDATE>051811
<CONTACT>JoAnn Stewart, Contract Specialist, Phone 7038756646, Fax 7038756085, Email stewartj@state.gov - Reaver T. Clements, Contract Specialist, Phone 7038755077, Fax 7038756085, Email clementsrl@state.gov
<DESC>Purpose: The Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Visa Office of Legislation and Regulations and the Office of Consular Systems and Technology Services, is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only. This does not constitute an Invitation for Bids nor a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI, or any subsequent RFP. The purpose of this Request for Information is to receive feedback and Capability Statements from the Small Business community and is in support of market research. <br />
<p>Background: Despite recent revisions to the organization and content of the visa volume of the Foreign Affairs Manual, the basic format and content parallel the Immigration and Nationality Act, As Amended, and Volume 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations. With current technological capabilities, much of the earlier rationale for the complex and unusual format is no longer valid. This long-standing format originally was required to ensure that field officers were easily able to cite relevant areas of law and regulation when seeking legal and other opinions of the Department, and in dealing with Members of Congress and the public, including with attorneys representing clients. The Bureau of Consular Affairs now seeks to develop a simpler, more interactive, and searchable 9 FAM (Visas). This is a complicated undertaking that will involve working with the new enterprise search engine being installed as part of the SMART messaging project or another enterprise search engine.</p>
<p>The Department's primary search engine, Autonomy, is producing somewhat better search results on 9 FAM than its predecessor did, but it still has difficulty searching through the 4000 pages of 9 FAM visa material. Even a new and more sophisticated search engine will have similar problems without an adequate taxonomy and more simplified text structure for this large volume. Reorganization and simplification of the format and drafting will provide Department users, at home and abroad, improved ability to retrieve unstructured and structured data through the OpenNet unclassified and classified Intranet home pages. Restructuring 9 FAM should permit process-related views of material and make searches easier.&nbsp; The Department relies on 9 FAM for definitive legal, policy, and procedural guidance.</p>
<p>Scope: The Department requires the new 9 FAM be a world-class, electronic 9 FAM-e, or content portal. This new portal will allow a user-friendly interface with enhanced search functionality to query both structured and unstructured content by keywords or similar means. This new portal will also allow easy data aggregation, which should be able to pull links and content together into a single place that helps users know where to go if they are looking for information. It is also envisioned that the new 9 FAM-e will allow more robust self-service capabilities, such as the ability to save previous searches (My Favorites), and allow for more robust user-interaction and a customizable experience.</p>
<p>This 9 FAM-e project is intended to provide, the full range of search and knowledge management services required to meet State's responsibilities under Federal legislation and executive orders including the newly implemented Plain Writing Act of 2010, Public Law 111-274.</p>
<p>Vendor Submission Instructions: Small Business Vendors who believe that they possess the expertise and experience to fulfill all of the requirements listed in the SOO are invited to please:</p>
<p>1. Submit technical and management capabilities; and experiences, addressing each of these areas in writing. Include: company name; address; e-mail address, telephone number; points of contact; and size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS).</p>
<p>2. Include a description of the solutions that may deliver end user functionality, or support the development, deployment, and maintenance of the 9 FAM-e as a system. As part of your discussion, please address the following: (a) Solution description and key features (b) Performance characteristics (c) Any architectural considerations (d) The degree of customization or configuration anticipated to meet the Government's requirements (e) Cost drivers.<br /><br />3. Discuss any implementation considerations you believe are relevant to the 9 FAM-e initiative as a whole. This discussion may include salient risks and mitigation measures, lessons learned from other projects or agencies, contracting approaches, or any other pertinent information.<br /><br />4. Describe your firm's capabilities as related to the scope of 9 FAM-e. Vendors are asked to provide relevant examples of previous work or solution implementations, to include client POCs. Federal and state government projects will be considered more relevant than commercial examples.<br /><br />5. Provide cost or price estimates for the delivery of a complete solution that meets all requirements listed in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Also please provide possible labor category information for fulfilling the requirements listed in the SOO.<br /><br />Your capabilities package must be company-specific. Capability packages that include teaming partners, subcontractors, etc. are not solicited and will not be reviewed.<br /><br />To the maximum extent possible, submit Non-Proprietary Information. All information received in this RFI that is appropriately marked "Proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI will not be returned nor will receipt be confirmed.</p>
<p>No phone calls related to this RFI will be accepted. All correspondence must be made via email. All responses need to be provided in electronic format (.PDF preferred). Font should be Times New Roman, size 12. Responses should not exceed 20 pages. All packages submitted by email must be free of any computer virus. If a virus is found, the package will be destroyed and a replacement will be requested, which must be provided within three days after notification. Please submit responses no later than 11:00 a.m EDT, May 18, 2011, to stewartj@state.gov. Cut-off for questions and answers is, May 4, 2011; 12 noon EDT. NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.<br />After review of vendor's questions, the following reply is issued: Thank you for your questions related to the 9 FAM-e Request for Information (RFI). At this time, 9 FAM-e is at the conceptual level and the most accurate depiction of the 9 FAM-e is contained in the SOO. This RFI is not tied to an acquisition and the responses will be used for informational purposes. We are therefore interested in any proposed solutions that your respective firms bring to the marketing research effort. We will provide additional details that will address your specific questions as we move forward to the acquisition phase.</p>

The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design-build capability. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks encompassing design-build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work such as, but not limited to, HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning), electrical, mechanical, architectural, and other major trades. Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order. Individual task orders may be as low as Y1,000,000, or may be well in excess of Y150,000,000; however most task orders will fall the range of Y5,000,000 to Y100,000,000 (Y stands for Japanese Yen currency). The estimated program value is Not-to-Exceed Y8,000,000,000 for a five-year period.</p>
<p>The Government may award multiple contracts up to eight; however, the government reserves the right to award less than eight. The multiple contract awards will be made to offerors who provide the Government with the best value, using Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) process in accordance with AFFARS 5315, and Mandatory Procedure (MP) 5315.305, paragraphs 5.5.2 and 5.6.2.1., and information Guide (IG) 5315.101-1, with evaluation factors to be included in the RFP consisting of: Technical Acceptability including Seed Project, Past Performance, and Price of Seed Project. This RFP includes a seed project, and award of the seed project at the time of contact award will satisfy the guaranteed minimum/Y500,000 for the MACC. All other successful awardees not receiving award of seed project at the time of contract award are guaranteed a minimum of Y500,000. The Government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees.</p>

<DESC><p>Synopsis: <br />This combined sources sought/synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Multiple purchase agreements are intended to be awarded as a result of this combined sources sought/synopsis. No other synopsis will be posted for this requirement. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and small business categories of qualified small business sources, according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to this inquiry will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, and type of small business set-aside. Only small businesses certified or qualified in NAICS code 531390 (size standard is $2M average annual sales) should submit a response to this notice. For more information regarding the SBA size standards, please visit http://www.sba.gov/size. <br />Background:<br />The Office of Rural Development in Michigan anticipates awarding Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) for Auctioneer services to sell approximately 40 single-family REO properties located throughout the state of Michigan. The period of performance is anticipated to be March through September 2011, with an optional performance period of October 2011 through September 2012. The accepted contractors shall provide live as well as internet/online sale capability, as well as services to conduct the auction in accordance with all applicable regulatory and statutory requirements, and ethical standards, according to the attached Statement of Work. USDA retains the sole right to determine the properties to be assigned and may elect not to use auctioneer services for any properties during the term of the agreement. <br />All contractors must register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and the On Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). CCR may be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov. The CCR Customer Assistance Center can be contacted toll free at 1-888-227-2423. Please include any small business categories which may apply, and do not "opt out" of public view. The ORCA website can be accessed through the CCR site.<br />The auctioneer must be registered in the state of Michigan, in good standing, and must meet the small business size standard as part of CCR Registration. If at least three responsible small business concerns are determined by the Government to be capable of performing this requirement based on an evaluation of responses, the requirement will be solicited as a 100% set-aside for small business, possibly in a particular category.<br />Information Sought:<br />Small businesses are to outline their experience by responding to the attached Evaluation Criteria. All questions must be answered to be considered responsive for any future contract actions. Submit responses to the Contracting Officer by 4:00 PM EST April 29, 2011 by e-mail at KarenD.Cooper@mi.usda.gov, facsimile at 517-203-2178, or in writing to the contracting office address. <br />All questions must be directed to the Contracting Officer in writing by e-mail or facsimile.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The Government is requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of creating a partnership* between the U.S. Census Bureau and a government contractor through a no-cost contract focused on exchanging geographic data commonly used by both partners. <br />
<p><br />OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The initial improvement of MAF/TIGER location accuracy and related data was completed for all counties and statistically equivalent entities (with the exception of Midway Island) in FY 2008 in preparation for the Census Bureau's 2010 Census. The next goal was to update the inventory of streets, other geographic features and structures through the 2010 Census (FY 2010). This was achieved through the various decennial programs, such as the Address Canvassing operation conducted in 2009, prior to the actual enumeration.</p>
<p>An ongoing Geography Division (GEO) goal is to maintain MTDB information to a specified currency throughout the upcoming decade. When TIGER information is updated with additions and deletions, the MAF information also must be updated concurrently. At critical periods before the selection of the sample for a household survey, or the preparation for a nationwide mailing of questionnaires, MAF/TIGER information must be current to a date specified by the Census Bureau. The goal is that all feature and structure data be no more than one year old or as required. Also, after sample selection or a mailing operation, the goal is to have all living quarters existing as of a given date identified and added to MAF/TIGER. The geographic partnerships with Federal, state, local, and tribal governments must also be maintained as part of the update system put into place.</p>
<p>GEO is currently preparing for a Geographic Support System (GSS) Initiative to support and maintain the geographic and cartographic infrastructure necessary for the Census Bureau's data collection, processing, tabulation, and dissemination programs for the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas.</p>
<p>There are three basic program elements the GSS Initiative supports:</p>
<p>1. Improve Address Coverage<br />2. Continuous Street Feature Updates<br />3. Quality Assessments</p>
<p>The overall goal of the GSS Initiative is to improve the inventory of addresses and roads in support of a targeted address canvassing for the 2020 Census. There is a program mid-lifecycle milestone in 2015 to determine progress toward, and continued feasibility of, this goal in 2015.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this cooperative research project is to create a partnership between the U.S. Census Bureau and a partner through a no-cost contract focused on sharing information (receipt and dissemination of information by each partner) by exchanging geographic data commonly used by both partners. These efforts shall result in the following deliverables: identifying a process of exchange, a beta-test of the process, and a final report summarizing the exercise with recommendations for future actions.</p>
<p>The partnership will reflect the attributes of an open, collaborative, and customer-oriented professional relationship. The expectation of each partner shall be limited to obtaining an increased knowledge in the functional process of sharing geographic information through a specific exchange of data identified as relevant to both partners (i.e. what works as well as what doesn't work in a one-on-one data exchange for update purposes). Neither partner shall enter into the partnership with an expectation of receiving payment or other monetary compensation for services rendered or supplies provided.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>Objective 1: To focus on sharing information including, but not limited to:<br />&bull; The contents of each organization's respective databases<br />&bull; The quality of information in the databases; how does each partner measure/evaluate?<br />&bull; The quality of the sources of the data; what is acceptable quality, how does each partner measure/evaluate?<br />&bull; The coverage of data and data sources<br />&bull; Each organization's knowledge about data collection, sources, feature updating, etc.</p>
<p>Objective 2: To prove-in a potential feature data exchange process by:<br />&bull; Realigning existing roads, if necessary, in either database<br />&bull; Uploading the partner's database roads that do not currently exist in the MTdb into the MTdb and/or uploading MTdb roads that do not currently exist in the partner's database into the partner's database (i.e. identifying new roads and updating the appropriate database).<br />&bull; Work related to this objective would encompass<br />-o Selecting a county with transportation features of varying positional accuracy, some of which exist only in the MTdb and some of which exist only in the partner's database.<br />-o Determining how roads can be matched between databases based on position and attributes.<br />-o Determining the attributes of importance.<br />-o Determining the criteria for identifying which database has the best positional accuracy. Is positional accuracy on the feature level more important than overall positional accuracy?<br />-o Determining whether it is necessary to realign existing roads prior to moving forward with updating new roads.<br />-o Identifying new roads and update appropriate databases.<br />-o All the above will contribute to developing a process to facilitate updating of databases</p>
<p>SUITABILITY FOR PARTICIPATION CRITERIA:</p>
<p>The U.S. Census bureau is interested in receiving responses to this RFI from contractor companies (businesses) that meet the following suitability criteria for this partnership:</p>
<p><br />1. Continuously update, maintain and create products from a nationwide geospatial database that is used in a commercial capacity. At a minimum the database must contain linear features that represent all street features within the United States. Ideally, the database contains other linear and aerial features such as railroads, hydrography and legal boundaries.</p>
<p><br />2. Possess well established quality assurance and quality control processes to ensure that the quality of the data in the database maintained. This includes processes to validate/verify that data going into, contained within, and coming out of the database adhere to established quality standards for both accuracy and completeness.</p>
<p><br />3. Have demonstrated experience with utilizing geospatial data from multiple sources (of varying spatial accuracy, and in multiple formats) to update the features within the database via automated or semi-automated processes. This includes updating the spatial location and attribute data for existing features, as well as the addition of new features that did not previously exist.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED<br />Respondents are instructed to provide capability statements that detail how their businesses meet the Suitability for Participation Criteria listed in the prior section of this RFI.</p>
<p><br />In addition, the following information should be provided in response to this RFI:<br />&bull; Name and Address of the Organization;<br />&bull; Point of contact, including name, title, telephone number, and e-mail address;<br />&bull; Brief description of the organization, business size, ownership, and services provided.<br />&bull; DUNS number and NAICS codes under which services are provided.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Place of Performance<br />While the majority of the work can be conducted via email and teleconference, some site visits (to Census Bureau Headquarters or to partner's place of work) will be required.</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />The Period of Performance for this project will not exceed nine (9) months from the start of the cooperative effort.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSIONS<br />Submissions shall be created using Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF formats with font size no smaller than 12-point pitch. Text shall be presented on 8 &frac12; x 11-inch paper with 1-inch margins. Submitters are asked to limit their responses to no more than 20 pages. Response to this RFI shall be submitted via e-mail to fermaint.rios@census.gov no later than May 12, 2011 by 2:00 PM EST.</p>
<p>*Within the context of this document, the use of the terms "Partner" and "Partnership" is defined as a contractual agreement between the U.S. Census Bureau and a non-governmental entity to collaborate, share and exchange information for the purpose of achieving the objectives stated herein. No other meaning should be inferred.</p>

<DESC>Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Design/Build and/or Construction for General Construction located primarily in North Carolina but also within the South Atlantic Division Area of Operations (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi). Projects will typically be located on military installations within North Carolina; however, performance of work is not necessarily restricted to such. A project requiring use of civil funds is not authorized under this contract.<br /><br />This acquisition is being offered as a HUBZone set aside. The life of the basic contract is for a base period of three (3) years with two (2) one-year option periods or $100M; whichever occurs first. The pool size (number of contracts that may be awarded) shall not exceed five (5) contractors. The pool of contractors which successfully receive an award will share the total contract capacity of $100M. The Government will use a best value Performance Price Trade-off (PPT) evaluation process in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.101-1. The order limitation of task orders issued against this MATOC, as well as used for evaluation purposes, shall range between $750K and $10M.

In accordance with FAR 52.216-22, the Government guarantees a minimum of $2,500.00 for each offeror (if any) awarded a contract. The evaluation factors and their relative importance for this solicitation and evaluation process are as follows: <br /><br />NON-COST FACTORS: FACTOR 1: CORPORATE RELEVANT SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE: This factor is equal in importance to FACTOR 2 and more important than FACTOR 3. FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE: This factor is equal in importance to FACTOR 1 and more important than FACTOR 3. FACTOR 3: DESIGN EXPERIENCE. This factor is the least important of all the factors.<br /><br />PRICE: All non-cost factors, when combined, are equally important as Price.<br /><br />Award will be made to that Offeror whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of criteria requested which offers the best overall value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers. Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow complete evaluation. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the Offeror.<br /><br />This solicitation will be issued in electronic format only. Paper copies of this solicitation will not be available. Other methods of requesting a package will not be honored. This solicitation is anticipated to be available on or about 08 April 2011. Note: The Response Date referenced under General Information does not refer to the PROPOSAL DUE DATE. Information on the PROPOSAL DUE DATE will be stated in the solicitation.

From: 	Scott Ivy, Contracting Officer, Great Lakes Acquisition Center (69D/GLAC)
	
Subj.: 	MFR - VA69D-P-1832

To: 	Contract File

In regards to VA69D-P-1832 and RFQ # VA-69D-11-RQ-0348
1.  I posted VA-69D-11-RQ-0348 as a sole source to Technical Communities/DBA Testmart. MD Medical submitted a compatability statement offering the same exact item and I requested a quote from them. 
2.  My technical expert determined that both companies were offering the same items. When comparing the quotes both companies offered the same exact items at the same exact dollar amount.
3.  I contacted the manufacturer to verify both companies were authorized to sell to the government and Lumenis stated they were. I sent out 2 different requests for best and final offers (BAFO) as lowest priced technically acceptable. Round one both came back with the original quote and refused to lower their quote. I waited a week and conducted the 2nd round of BAFO (28 April 2011) MD Medical still refused to lower their quote but Technical Communities/DBA Testmart lowered their quote by $1,000. I Awarded to Testmart 28 April 2011.  

4. Notice of non-award will be sent to the following on 28 April 2011 stating award at $167,299.10 to Technical Communities/DBA Testmart. 
A. Miller and Dickey (MD) Medical, $168,299.10.
5.  It is my decision to award to Technical Communities/DBA Testmart.
6.  A GSA Waiver was not required for this acquisition.
7.  This is a final decision of the Contracting Officer.
