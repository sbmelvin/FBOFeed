<SUBJECT>ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS OF BLACKTIP SHARKS
<SOLNBR>NFFN7110-12-04383SLW
<RESPDATE>073012
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Fax 757-664-3845, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service, Panama City, FL, plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium, Dauphin Island Sea Laboratory (Dr. Will Patterson) in Dauphin Island AL to provide blacktip shark elemental analysis.
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The blacktip shark is common in the US Atlantic from South Carolina to the Florida Keys, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It is an important commercial and recreational species in the southeastern United States. Female blacktip sharks along US Atlantic and Florida Gulf coasts migrate to nursery areas beginning in May, where juveniles are born and remain for up to 6 months until fall and then migrate to wintering grounds. This restricted pattern of activity on their nursery grounds makes blacktip shark an optimal candidate for incorporating distinct site-specific elemental and isotopic signatures.</p>
<p>The lack of geographical barriers to movement and the documented mobility of blacktip sharks suggest that sufficient dispersal may occur to prevent the development of genetic population structure throughout the northwestern Atlantic, Gulf, and Caribbean Sea. Despite the species' dispersal potential, a previous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis detected significant haplotype frequency differences between young sharks from nurseries on the Gulf coast of Florida and the Atlantic coast of South Carolina. Results were interpreted as supporting female philopatry to natal nursery areas. However, the reproductive structure of blacktip shark nurseries throughout the remainder of the Gulf of Mexico is unknown. The characterization of stock structure, and nursery residency and subsequent use of this information by fishery managers is critical to the long-term success of conservation and fishery management programs. Failure to detect existing population structure can allow the removal of too many individuals from small regional populations, resulting in localized extirpations and reduced overall recruitment. This is a 12 month consecutive project.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL TASKS:<br />All vertebral centra will be obtained from field sampled age-0 sharks though collaborations with the National Marine Fisheries Service's Panama City Laboratory. Vertebral centra first will be sectioned (0.5 mm width) with a low-speed isomet saw. Each section will be aged by two readers independently by counting opaque zone without knowledge of fish size. Sections will be read using transmitted light and an image analysis system to confirm sharks are age-0. Following aging, vertebral sections will be assayed for Ba, Ca, Cd, Hg, Li, Mn, Mg, Pb, Sr, and Zn with a New Wave Research EO LUV 266 laser system integrated with a Finnigan MAT Element2 sector field ICP-MS. The laser is this system is a solid state Nd:YAG laser with an output frequency of 266 nm with a maximum energy of 4 mJ. Pre-ablation will be performed prior to sample analysis to remove any surface contamination. Image analysis software then will control the laser's path such that sample transects of 50 &mu;m wide x 50 &mu;m long x 50 &mu;m deep laser spots will be rastered from the center of vertebral sections to their edge. Ablated material will be swept by He gas into the ICP-MS's plasma. Standard reference materials (SRM) will be National Institute of Standards glass beads (NIST 612), as well as a solid carbonate standard prepared and certified by the U.S. Geological Survey (MACS-3). These SRMs will be used to calibrate the ICP-MS, as well as to test periodically and correct for instrument drift.</p>
<p>Element:Ca ratios will be computed for elements whose concentrations are consistently above instrument detection limits (3 sd of mean blank values). A multivariate analysis of variance will be computed to test for differences in shark vertebrae element:Ca signatures (integrated from the terminus of the natal opaque band to the edge of a given vertebra section), with sample location (i.e., nursery area) as the independent variable and element:Ca ratios as the dependent variables. The discriminant function analysis will then be employed to test the efficacy of distinguishing nursery areas with vertebrae chemical signatures.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES:<br />Upon completion of LA-IC-MS analyses of shark vertebrae samples and conduct of statistical analysis all data and the written report shall be provided to, NOAA Fisheries, Panama City, Laboratory within 12 months of award.</p>
<p>SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:<br />No federal government property and/or equipment will be provided for this statement of work. The appropriate quality assurance shall be employed at all stages of this project.</p>
<p>REQUIRED EXPERIENCE: <br />Vendor should have current and past history with conducting research on fish hard part chemistry. This experience should involve examining bony fish otolith chemistry as a natural tag to distinguish nursery contributions to adult populations or trace inter- and intra-annual mixing among adult populations.<br />Vendor must have experience with laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) techniques. This experience should include using LA-ICP-MS to examine habitat residency in elasmobranchs based on Sr:Ca ratios in vertebrae centra.<br />Vendor must have access to the equipment to perform LA-ICP-MS analysis such as sectioning machines, ultraclean hoods, chemical hoods, and water polishers.<br />Vendor must have peer-reviewed manuscripts and/or technical reports on LA-ICP-MS and related research literature on Hard Part Chemistry.</p>
<p>Assaying calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr) phosphorus (P) in elasmobranch vertebrae is only possible through laser ablation-inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The method has only been available since 2006. The previous study did not find conclusive evidence. Since that time the Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium (Dr. Patterson) has been able to refine the technique to apply to elasmobranch vertebrae. The laser spec, is the only known method that can be used because it's the only reliable and accurate way to measure concentrations of calcium phosphorus in vertebrae.</p>
<p>Dr. Patterson has 15 years of experience conducting research on fish hard part chemistry. Principally, this work has involved examining bony fish otolith chemistry as a natural tag to distinguish nursery contributions to adult populations or trace inter- and intra-annual mixing among adult populations. While other institutions and researchers have conducted work on fish hard part chemistry, Dr. Patterson is the first individual to successfully apply laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) techniques to examine habitat residency in elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) based on Sr:Ca ratio. Unlike fish hard parts (ear bones), elasmobranch vertebrae are a more porous structure and require special skills that Dr. Patterson has already developed. Providing a contract to another individual will require added costs as individuals other than Dr. Patterson will need to learn the methods that could take additional time and delay the completion of this research. <br />This project is in direct response to the recent stock assessment for blacktip sharks that was conducted by NOAA Fisheries Service in 2012. Considerable debate occurred at this assessment regarding the extent of the stock and location of nurseries for blacktip shark in the Gulf of Mexico. Indeed, a major research recommendation from this assessment was to examine the stock structure of blacktip sharks in the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 2012). It is critical for NOAA Fisheries Service to understand the extent of the stock of these sharks prior to the next assessment. Failure to understand the extent of the stock could lead to spurious estimates on its status and potentially lead to litigation to the US government.</p>

<SUBJECT>FOLLOW ON CONTRACT TO ADD SEVEN ADDITIONAL SEA DAYS
<SOLNBR>NFFN7600-12-04904SLW
<RESPDATE>072612
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Fax 757-664-3845, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), located in Miami, FL intends to award a follow on purchase order to the Inwater Research Group, Inc.. to add seven additional sea days to a current Purchase Order.
<p>This follow-on is to cover an additional 7 days at sea and associated staff time, travel costs, and equipment costs to locate and capture sea turtles in offshore waters of the North Central Gulf of Mexico off the southern coast of Louisiana. The capture effort will consist of day trips to the expected sampling location staged out of ports along the Louisiana coast. The work to be conducted, activities, and contractor requirements are the same as in the original statement of work for this contract. In addition, this contract will extend the period of performance by one year to September 20, 2013 .</p>
<p>The SEFSC has recently entered into an interagency agreement with the Department of Interior's Bureau of Offshore Energy Management (BOEM) to deploy satellite telemetry tags on loggerhead and Kemp's ridley sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico. As part of this project, SEFSC needs to deploy 10-15 tags on sea turtles in ocean waters (30-60 miles offshore) of central Louisiana. The ideal time period for this work is September -October because aerial survey data indicates high densities of sea turtles in this area at that time of year. Inwater research group has the expertise and permits required to accomplish this task, and the work is consistent with their current contract with SEFSC.</p>
<p>Due to the possibility of low encounter rates with turtles in these waters, the government is budgeting additional time to search for and capture turtles. The government anticipates that a maximum of 15 turtle captures and tag deployments will be accomplished during this period. The extension of the contract performance period through September 30, 2013 is needed to allow for the possibility that unfavorable weather conditions will occur during the target time period.</p>
<p><br />A follow-on order for additional sea days and turtle captures is justified for the following reasons:</p>
<p>A) Awarding to another source would require duplication of effort and additional cost</p>
<p>Inwater Research Group has experience in the specialized mission of locating and capturing sea turtles for biological sampling and the deployment of satellite telemetry tags. In addition, they have demonstrated local knowledge and specialized capabilities that improve their efficiency at locating turtles and thereby maximizing the effectiveness of the effort while at sea. They also have appropriate permits that are required for the capture and handling of sea turtles. During the initial solicitation for this exercise, no other source could be found with this same level of experience and demonstrated capability.</p>
<p>Awarding the follow-on order to a different source would require the additional administrative costs of seeking and reviewing other sources. While another source may be able to provide appropriate vessel services, there would be costs in training that source in the effective search, capture, and handling of sea turtles. These training missions would reduce the effectiveness of each day at sea, thereby increasing the number of days required to capture the same number of turtles. This would increase the cost of the Government and reduce the likelihood of a successful mission.</p>
<p>The cost per day at sea offered by Inwater Research Group is comparable to other vessels of this size, and hence it is very unlikely that competition would reduce the per sea day cost sufficiently to offset both the higher number of sea days required and the risk of mission failure.</p>
<p>B) There would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to deploy satellite telemetry tags on sea turtles in the central and western Gulf of Mexico. This will compliment studies conducted in the eastern Gulf of Mexico during prior years. Aerial survey data indicates a very high abundance of both Kemp's and Loggerhead sea turtles in the waters offshore of western Louisiana during September and October. High densities of sea turtles are not seen in this area during winter months. Therefore, it is essential to conduct this sampling effort during the early fall, preferably during September. After that time, it will be more difficult to find sea turtles, and it will require a greater number of sea days to accomplish the mission. It is possible that after this period it will not be possible to capture a sufficient number of turtles, and hence the effort would have to be delayed for an additional year.</p>
<p>Inwater Research Group has a vessel and vessel staff available for the mission during September of 2012, and the Government has scientific staff available to deploy the satellite tags once turtles have been captured. Additional administrative delays involved in searching for another source, preparing additional contracts, and arranging for the placement of a vessel and equipment in the right location may result in missing the critical window for the study and thereby delay the mission.</p>
<p>Conducting a follow-on order to the current contract will provide cost-benefits to the Government by reducing administrative costs and delays and by ensuring that the most cost-effective project will be conducted. The at sea capture of sea turtles is a highly specialized requirement, and Inwater Research Group has demonstrated a unique level of capability and effectiveness. Awarding a new contract to another source would incur additional costs to the government because additional sea days would be required for training and to account for the inefficiency of a less experienced vendor. The additional administrative requirements of conducting the search would also increase the likelihood of an unacceptable delay in the mission since the timing of the effort is critical. For these reasons, a follow-on order to the above referenced contract is in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 541990. The government knows of no source with this level of experience working with the government. Inwater Research Group, Inc. is the only known source that can provide this service. Firms who believe they can provide the services must submit detailed information concerning their vessel and capability, along copies of permits, to provide the services and satisfy the Government's needs. In addition shall include name, telephone number and address of concerns for which you have furnished this type of service previously. Interested parties must respond within five (5) days after publication of this notice. The Eastern Region Administrative Division (ERAD), requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/.

Has documented software and operations procedures for real-time seismic systems. 
The offeror shall briefly describe, summarize or provide an overview of projects for all the areas listed above that have been successfully completed within the last five years.  Provide contact information on these projects.  Statements by past clients may be used in the evaluation of the vendor's technical quote under any and all applicable evaluation criteria. Any information obtained by the Government from references outside the vendor's quote may be used in a similar manner.
Factor (B) Qualifications of Technical Personnel: Offerors shall provide resume and/or qualifications of technical personnel, showing the qualifications needed to complete the requested work listed in the Statement of Work.  Qualifications shall include, but not be limited to, seismic network operations and data acquisition and developing seismological algorithms for real-time operations, particularly details of programming experience on such systems.  
Factor (C) Past Performance:  The offeror shall submit references from one (1) to two (2) customers who have purchased similar services within the last five years.  Offerors shall provide a point of contact name, phone number, email and company address for those references.  Statements by past clients may be used in the evaluation of the vendor's technical quote under any and all applicable evaluation criteria. Any information obtained by the Government from references outside the vendor's quote may be used in a similar manner.
 (b)  Options.  The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.
In determining which proposal offers the greatest value or advantage to the Government, overall technical merit will be more important than evaluated price.  Price will become the determining factor between proposals judged to be essentially equal in technical merit.  PPIRS.gov will be used as a source of past performance information in the source selection process, in addition to any other past performance information acquired both inside and outside the government.
Your proposal should be straightforward and free of extraneous information. Technical proposals will be evaluated without reference to proposed prices/costs. Therefore, no references to price or cost may be included in your technical proposal. If helpful, technical proposals should include information on staffing levels and/or estimated levels of effort, but such data should not include dollar rates or costs.  Simply repeating or paraphrasing the specifications or statement of work does not constitute an acceptable technical proposal. Technical proposals must demonstrate how the offeror proposes to meet stated requirements or goals, and that the offeror has the necessary understanding, expertise, facilities, personnel, and experience to successfully accomplish the proposed work.  The technical proposal should contain (1) identifying cover page; (2) table of contents; (3) listing(s) of tables, drawings, and/or exhibits, if any; and (4) a short introduction or summary describing the overall approach, if desired.  The main body of the technical proposal must provide sufficient information and detail to permit the evaluators to score the proposal on each of the factors listed above in Evaluation - Commercial Items.

An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (m) of this provision.

<p>Section C - Specifications</p>
<p>The government has identified the following salient characteristics required for the items listed in Schedule B:</p>
<p>(CLIN 0001): The government requires base layer clothing that will be part of a cold weather clothing system that employs the use of multiple layers to protect the wearer. Due to the variation in climate and temperature that the wearer will be subjected to. The government is requesting tops that will be used in warm to cold weather that weighs no more than .5 kg to .75kg. The shirts must be equipped with gusset underarms to allow for maximum movement. Furthermore the shirts are required to have a crew style collar so as to prevent chaffing by equipment on the wearers neck. Since this shirt will be part of a layering system the top is required to fit close to the body (anatomical shaping for fit). The government requires a top that is a raglan style long sleeve design, the top must utilize a raglan style sleeve to allow for maximum movement of the wearers arms in all directions without binding, as the wearer of this garment will be wearing multiple layers comfort and ease of movement are performance design characteristics being requested. The government requires a top that reduces the bulk created by a standard overstitch design, as such the government is requiring a top that utilizes a flat lock stitch design. The government requires that the top be composed of moisture resistant fabric that is breathable, lightweight, durable, odor resistant, quick-drying and stretchable. The material must further be a non-petroleum based material so as to not be highly flammable and to not adhere to the wearer's skin in the event of a fire. The government requires tops that are odor-resistant, and will not cause discomfort to the wearer in terms of a fabric that would be likely to cause skin irritation, this characteristic is being required due to the nature of the tops being a base layer of a cold weather clothing system. The government requires that the tops offer an ultraviolet protection rating of 40 or higher and be constructed of merino wool. If applicable, any company logos or markings shall match the color of the top or be tonal.<br /><br />(CLIN 0002): The government requires base layer clothing that will be part of a cold weather clothing system that employs the use of multiple layers to protect the wearer.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>IAW WITH THE SETUP OF ALL TENTS.
