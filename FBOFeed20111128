<SUBJECT>DARPA SSO/UITSS Four Month Contract Extension 
<SOLNBR>HR0011-12-R-0001
<RESPDATE>121311
<CONTACT>Jessica L. Morris, Contract Specialist, Phone 5712184961, Email jessica.morris@darpa.mil
<DESC>This is a sole source synopsis for the acquisition of a four month performance period extension, 01 January 2012 to 30 April 2012, for current Unclassified IT Support and Services (UITSS) contract HR0011-06-D-0001 with Wyle Information Systems, in support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Support Services Office (SSO). In accordance with the authority at FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements", DARPA intends to negotiate a contract modification for the&nbsp;four month extension.
<p>This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for this requirement and is issued for notification purposes only.</p>
<p>The current support services are set to expire on 31 December 2011. Wyle Information Systems needs to continue to provide support services for the four month period because DARPA/SSO requires a team of individuals that are familiar with the current DARPA IT environment and the strategic plan in order to provide full spectrum IT Services. Wyle has five (5) years of experience with the current systems and knowledge of how DARPA conducts IT business on a day to day basis. If the proposed contractor is not selected 3-5 months of effort and cost will need to be incurred to facilitate a new teams understanding of the customizations included in the DARPA systems and the business operations in order to effectively execute the action. During that time there would be significant risk to DARPA's IT systems and the ability of the Agency to carry out its mission, as management of the IT systems would not be sufficiently staffed, and there would be a lack of knowledge of current systems and architecture to ensure that the networks operate properly.</p>
<p>To this end, a separate competition for the performance of IT services at DARPA is currently underway with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. A Pre-solicitation notice was published on 23 November 2011 with the solicitation number W911NF-12-R-0002. The Request for Proposal is expected to be released on or about 08 December 2011.</p>

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /></span></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Mask Particulate Respirator (N95) on or about <strong>January 15, 2012,</strong> but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days. The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br />Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to, the N95 Respirator, disposable, fluid resistant (160mmHg), size medium/large or regular and the N95 Respirator, disposable, fluid resistant (160mmHg), size small and other items. The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $10,358,864 annually. <br />NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <strong>Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /></strong>Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website. <br />

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) that preceeds that actual solicitation.   Please respond by 12/29/2011 with a Capability Statement for the requirement below. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR FORMAL PROPOSALS.


1.0	SCOPE  

The scope of this effort is to provide system safety oversight support to the Program Manager (PM), Digital Fires Situational Awareness (DFSA) Target Location, Designation Hand-off System (TLDHS) Project, of Product Group 11, Marine Corps Systems Command.  The Contractor will follow the MIL-STD-882D guidance to eliminate or manage safety hazards, develop and update the safety documents, conduct software safety testing, incorporate and provide safety and warning devices, review procedures and training materials, report and manage safety risks, and perform limited software code quality assurance reviews in support of the Government Software Acceptance Testing.
 Execution will be done in accordance to the TLDHS requirements and MIL-STD-882D. Specific details of the scope and support required for this effort are further delineated in Section 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0. 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
PM DFSA has the need for independent safety oversight as part of the TLDHS system safety systems engineering process, required by the DoDI 5000.2 and USD (AT&L) Memo dated Sep 23, 2004. The safety oversight support is used to eliminate environmental, safety, and occupational health (ESOH) hazards, or minimize their risks.    

3.0 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 

The TLDHS is a modular, man-portable digital fires system designed for the Forward Observer (FO), Forward Air Controllers (FACs), Fire Support Teams (FSTs), Firepower Control Teams (FCTs), Tactical Air Control Parties (TACP), and Reconnaissance Teams to quickly acquire targets in day, night, and near-all-weather visibility conditions, conduct precise, near-instantaneous artillery fire support, naval gunfire support, and digital close air support (CAS) with strike aircraft, such as the F/A-18, AV-8B, A-10 and F-16.
  Operators are able to accurately determine their own location as well as that of their targets, digitally transmit (hand-off) data to supporting arms elements for fire mission planning.  This system interfaces with other Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) platforms to exchanges digital fires data, such as the Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P), Blue Force Tracker (BFT), Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS), Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS), Common Laser Range Finder (CLRF), Remote Video Viewing Terminal (RVVT), and Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC).
  It is also inside the Combat Operations Center (COC), offering its capability to the Regimental or Division Air Officer.  The Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S) is also incorporating the software to get ground tracks into the Joint Range Extension Gateway (JRE-G) gate, much like the Direct Air Support Centers (DASC) are doing today.

TLDHS is composed of a Military Ruggedized Tablet running StrikeLink software and associated equipment.  Associated equipment includes the AN/PRC-117F/G radio, Power Distribution Device, CD DVD R/W drive, external USB hard drive and associated cables.  The CLRF is an integral part of the operational system; however, it is not a component of the principle end item for TLDHS.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is issuing a Requuest for Information to seek comprehensive integrated software solutions that exist today that can meet the requirements identified below within the scope of 360,000 workstations and 24,000 server processors supporting a workforce of more than 600,000 users (including employees, volunteers, and contactors).  VA has a comprehensive Microsoft solution already in place that provides a seamless integrated environment where users are presented a single sign on and can then access all capabilities within the full set of products licensed by VA.  The comprehensive and seamless integration of the existing product set allows users to interchange data between the individual applications through cut/paste and retain linkages and characteristics to/of the original data.

<DESC>Request for Information
Renewable Energy Generation/Production
US Navy
NAVSTA Guantanamo Bay, Cuba


The Department of Navy (DoN) is considering issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) at some future time for renewable energy generation opportunities on US Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. DoN is particularly interested in wind and solar generation and bio-diesel fuel production but other technically and economically feasible technologies may also be included.

DoN will provide Government land for a renewable energy generation system, or systems, to be developed, constructed, owned, operated and maintained by a private entity. Attached to this RFI is a map of the installation with possible sites indicated in red.
 In order for the DoN to determine whether to develop a RFP, we seek to identify responsible sources and obtain information regarding renewable opportunities and risks associated with this specific installation. The results of this Request for Information will assist in developing a possible Request for Proposal (RFP) to be issued at a later date.

Specifically, the DoN objectives are: 

-Maximize the land opportunity for the development of renewable generation on the specified installation.
-Provide energy security for the installation. 
-Reduce the DoN carbon footprint.
-Maximize the financial benefits of the opportunity. 
-Purchase power and/or energy at a lower cost than current cost to generate power.
 

The specific information the DoN seeks at this time: 

1)	Name and brief description of company.
2)	The renewable resource and technology that maximizes the opportunity at the site.
3)	Indicate why these technologies present the best opportunity for development. Indicate any economies of scale in pursuing more than one technology, and what if any contractual arrangements would be beneficial. 
4)	Any innovative and/or new conceptual ideas and recommendations for alternatives for the sale of power and/or arrangement for the taking of power. 
5)	Indicate any additional information that you feel may be required.  Answers to questions will be made available to all responders.
6)	The Government is interested in obtaining the financial scale and scope required to implement these projects for planning purposes only.
  It is NOT necessary, nor required for respondents to provide proprietary detailed cost information.

All information submitted will be reviewed and analyzed by the US Navy, and will be considered proprietary and confidential with respect to other responders and to future contract actions taken by the Navy. It is not mandatory to submit a response to this RFI to participate in any formal request for proposal process that may take place in the future. However, it should be noted that information gathered through this RFI may significantly influence how the DoN proceeds in such a process.  

The desired goal for the DoN with this RFI is to solicit maximum industry participation, which will allow the DoN to formulate an acquisition process in a concise and timely manner.
 This request for information shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the requested information. 

Responses must be complete and sufficiently detailed to address the specific information DoN is seeking. Responses must be on 8 by 11-inch standard paper, single spaced, 12 point font minimum and are limited to 15 single sided pages (including all attachments). 

Responses to the RFI are due on 13 January 2012, by 2:00 PM EST. LATE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Packages may be sent via email to maureen.hoesly@navy.mil  and 
sharan.lind-shields@navy.mil OR to the following address: Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic, ACQ3 (ATTN: Ms.
 Maureen Hoesly), 6506 Hampton Blvd., Bldg. A, Norfolk, VA 23508-1278.

<SUBJECT>Market Research and Request for Information (RFI) For Dismounted Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronics Warfare (CREW) System ***Mod to N0017412SN003, 004 & 005***
<SOLNBR>N0017412SN006
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:omar.roque@navy.mil">Omar Roque</a>
<DESC>This notice is issued by the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 requires the Government to conduct market research before developing new requirements documents for an acquisition. Results of market research are used to determine whether qualified sources exist and whether commercial items are available to meet the requirement.

One of the ways the Government conducts market research is to issue a Request for Information (RFI).

A RFI provides a broad statement of need, briefly describes the Governments intention regarding program/acquisition approach, and identifies key events in the acquisition program schedule. 


Description:

This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes, as part of a market survey on services for Dismounted Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronics Warfare (CREW) system.
 This particular system is intended to be worn by an individual, and provide protection to only that individual. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION FOR BID NOTICE. The document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to identify potential solutions for individual dismounted CREW hardware.

NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.

Requirements have been identified for a CREW capability that provides a small zone of protection for an individual troop. Threshold and objective level performance parameters have been identified. Although it is desired that the initial fielded capability meets objective level requirements, the system must meet threshold performance parameters and be ready for fielding in 2Q of CY12.
 Based on performance and capabilities of the initial fielded hardware, an improved capability may be developed for fielding in 2Q CY13 that fully meets objective performance parameters. The Government has a desire to assess the capabilities of any hardware that has potential to meet the requirements.

In order to meet the requested fielding timeline, prototype hardware must be available to the government no later than the end of January 2012. Threshold and objective performance requirements can be provided separately at a classified level. It is requested that white papers be submitted that fully describe system capabilities with respect to the classified performance levels in as much detail as possible.
 Based on the submissions, the Government may elect to conduct one-on-one discussions with Industry based on its analysis of the RFI responses, the quality of submission, and the level and scope of the information provided. This may include visits to contractors facilities to assess firsthand the validity of described capabilities.

A laboratory demonstration at the contractor facility may also be requested. Those capabilities or systems that show promise may be selected for additional testing at Government locations. The additional testing will be pursued outside of this RFI. Test results from closed loop or range testing will be releasable to a variety of DoD activities. 


Response Format:

Interested parties who believe they are capable of filling this requirement are invited to indicate their interest by providing a white paper; (a) company name, company address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), cage code, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number; and (b) business size and unique qualifiers (e.g.large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, woman owned, etc.)

Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI in Microsoft Word for Office 2007  compatible format.
 RFI responses are limited to 15 pages, including cover and administrative pages. Response documents shall be written using a 10 point font size or larger.

The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any proprietary (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:


1.Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) proprietary with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.

2.
 In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as proprietary may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 3 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.

3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.

Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Governments rights in the data.

4.
 Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the proprietary legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends proprietary portion begins: and proprietary portion ends.

Response Deadline and Submissions:

Parties may begin submitting responses to this request for information immediately. Submissions are due by 1600 hours Eastern Time on 7 Dec 2011.

Responses shall be sent via email to: Omar Roque at omar.roque@navy.mil.

Note the Government is under no obligation to conduct these sessions, nor is it liable for any costs or expenses incurred in replying to this RFI.
 The information provided in response to this RFI will be used to support on-going initiatives within DoD to analyze emerging requirements for dismounted CREW systems and ultimately may result in the Government developing and issuing a RFP for respondents


QUESTION 1: Can you tell me if these efforts are currently being performed by a contractor? If so, could you please provide the Incumbent name as well as the contract number?

Answer: There is no incumbent contractor for this requirement.


QUESTION 2: How do we obtain a copy of the classified information


Answer: Please submit requests to Omar Roque at omar.roque@navy.mil


QUESTION 3: If our proposal contains classified information, how should we submit that portion of the proposal?


Answer: Please email Omar Roque for delivery instructions.

QUESTION 4: In order to meet the requested fielding timeline, prototype hardware must be available to the government no later than the end of January 2012.

This does not appear realistic if the process is going to involve a solicitation, bid, review and contract award.
  It suggests that such prototype hardware already exists and there will be some way for an agreement to be put in place within the next few weeks to make the hardware available to the government no later than the end of January 2012.  Please clarify.

If we can provide devices for fielding that meet requirements for this application by the end of the second quarter of CY2012, can the date for a prototype hardware demo/availability be extended past the end of January 2012?

Answer: The timeline associated with this effort is very condensed based upon the operational tempo in the area of operations.  If the requirement for the iCREW capability is ultimately approved by DoD, a rapid acquisition authority may be granted to shorten the contracting timeline.
  It is recommended that realistic dates be provided for delivery of test hardware, even if those dates do not match those in the RFI.  Responses with dates that extend the timeline will not be automatically rejected.  That is only one factor to be evaluated in all responses to the RFI.

It has been determined that PerkinElmer Health Services is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government?s requirements, as they have been the sole provider of  these repair services, as the NEIC has purchased several pieces of instrumentation from PerkinElmer and held multiple service contracts with them over the past few years.  PerkinElmer is the only company with access to the service data bulletins on the Optima 5300 DV, Elan DRCII and LC used  at the NEIC to describe developing problems with the equipment and any subsequent reports or replacement parts that may be necessary.  PerkinElmer service engineers are specifically trained on the instrument software systems, and have a complete understanding of the software and how it relates to the instrument?s use. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA?s requirement as stated herein may request a copy of the Statement of Work and submit a capability statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement must provide evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Cara Lynch, at lynch.cara@epa.gov by COB on December 12, 2011.

<DESC>Special Notice
Analytical Laboratory Services Supporting the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation, Cycle 3 (UCMR 3) 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Water, Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW), Technical Support Center will require contract laboratory support for analytical services in conjunction with the implementation of the third cycle of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR 3).  The EPA has the responsibility to investigate contaminant occurrence in order to characterize drinking water threats. EPA relies on independent research efforts, but also is heavily engaged in conducting drinking water occurrence studies like the UCMR 3 to obtain new data.  The UCMR 3 was proposed March 3, 2011 and is expected to be promulgated as a final regulatory action in early 2012.  To get more information on UCMR 3, go to: http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/ucmr/ucmr3.
As a means to reduce the UCMR 3 compliance burden on small public water systems (those serving less than 10,000 individuals), EPA selects a representative sample of small systems that must comply with the UCMR 3 monitoring requirements.  EPA pays the analytical costs for the water samples collected at these small water systems.  The anticipated future procurement will specifically serve as the means for conducting these sample analyses.   Any offering laboratory interested in providing chemical contaminant analytical monitoring services under the future anticipated procurement must seek and receive EPA approval for the EPA methods identified for UCMR 3 chemical contaminants by May 31, 2012.  For EPA Method 522, EPA will only collect enough sample volume from small systems to process the 100 mL sample size, so laboratories are advised to follow ?Option 1? when applying for Method 522. To learn more about the UCMR 3 Laboratory Approval Program, go to: http://water.epa.gov/lawsr egs/rulesregs/sdwa/ucmr/ucmr3/laboratories.cfm 
Proficiency Testing is an integral part of the UCMR3 Laboratory Approval Program.  A lab must pass a PT study for each method for which it seeks to gain UCMR 3 approval.  The anticipated schedule is as follows:PT#	Deadline for application submission	Deadline for completed application*	Date PT shipped	PT Results Submission DeadlinePT1	11/7/2011	12/5/2011	1/9/12	1/23/12PT2	1/23/2012	2/21/12	3/5/12		3/19/12PT3	3/12/2012	4/9/12  	5/7/12	5/21/12PT4	6/25/2012	7/23/12	8/20/12	9/4/12PT5	9/24/2012	10/22/12	11/19/12	12/3/12
*  "Deadline for completed application." An application is considered complete when there are no additional questions or clarifications needed in the review of each method application. Laboratories will be notified when an application is complete and the laboratory is considered "PT Ready". 
This schedule is dependent upon several factors and is subject to change. A PT study may be cancelled if there are none or an insufficient number of laboratories considered "PT Ready" on the deadline for completed applications. Upon successful completion of one PT study per method, laboratories will be notified in writing of EPA approval on a method-by-method basis. Please note that UCMR 3 monitoring is expected to begin in January 2013.

<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

Materials will be evaluated using both the traditional wet-mixed method and the accelerated dry-placement method. The traditional method includes the use of fixed volume "drum type" or volumetric mixers. The dry-placement method involves dispensing the aggregate-cementitious blend directly into the prepared excavation and metering the required mix-water over the backfill surface. The mix-water is allowed to percolate through the dry material matrix, hydrating the cementitious materials, providing a hardened layer with the properties of in-place flowable fill. ERDC researchers will examine the current rapid repair methods in addition to developing optimized procedures that minimize labor intensity, manpower, equipment, and construction time requirements. <br><br>Specifications<br>1.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:   

1.
  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees. 

2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:  

	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D.
	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof
	of insurance.
	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the
	prime contractor including contract number and term).
	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year
	covering the previous two years.
  Contractor employee background checks are
	conducted at contractor expense.  The background check:

(a)	must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports.
(b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S. for less than two years).  
(c)	will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III).  If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.
  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at
Government expense.

Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshals Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).  

3.  Permanent Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years.  Submit all items listed above under business access.  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.
  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractors expense.

4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.
  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.
  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:
	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.
	b.    is illegally present in the United States.
c.	   is subject to an outstanding warrant.
d.	   has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or                fradulent  information.
	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.

7.  Employee Identification:  Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer.
 

8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractors employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.

9.  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched a new program in Afghanistan in July 2009, in line with U.S. Government priorities. The program implements civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, during the shape, clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The program seeks to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects.  In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partners, manages an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  Activities focus on stability assistance, which incorporates a range of sectors, including, but not limited to, irrigation and small infrastructure, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, and small livelihood activities. All activities are community driven and strive to address sources of instability which often includes increasing the legitimacy of GIRoA.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Program Manager is a member of one of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, D.C. OTI currently has four regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak), Asia and Middle East (AME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.   <br />With this solicitation, OTI intends to hire Program Managers for its Af/Pak team.  After an initial time with Af/Pak, at the discretion of senior leadership, there may also be opportunities to work with other Regional Teams within OTI.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to hire qualified personnel needed to assist and support OTI's Afghanistan/Pakistan regional team with program implementation-related activities.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Program Manager's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.</p>
<p>The work of the Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Regional Team Leader or his/her designee (e.g. the Sr. Program Manager), the Program Manager will:</p>
<p><br />At the GS-11 equivalent level:</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries;</p>
<p>&bull;	Implement and manage assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field, being prepared to travel to difficult posts in overseas conflict or post-conflict areas for up to one month or more if required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide backstopping and troubleshooting support to field-based staff through frequent communication;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor/train other OTI Program Assistants/Program Managers as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure completion of OTI project administration, budgeting and contracting action needs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and/or participate in the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and personal services contractors;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) for Task Orders with a contractor for Program Office services, ensuring OTI's requirements are met (serving as COTR requires the successful completion of a USAID training course within the first 6-12 months of employment);</p>
<p>&bull;	In limited circumstances, the incumbent may be required to provide assistance to organizations outside of OTI but within the current scope of work, where such assistance would enhance both OTI's goals and objectives as well as the incumbent's job skills;</p>
<p>&bull;	Participate in design and implementation of new country program operations to include management, logistical, budget, administrative, personnel and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull;	Respond to requests for information and taskers regarding OTI programs from within and outside the Agency in collaboration with OTI's Program Office;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, participate on inter-office, inter-bureau, or inter-agency committees where issues relate to OTI's program goals;</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions, the Department of State, other USG agencies and departments, NGOs, international donors, and others interested in particular OTI country programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Initiate and manage the preparation of documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop, monitor, evaluate and recommend performance measures for country programs and individual projects, including the work of contractors and grantees;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting team leader or country or deputy country representative in his/her absence, for example.</p>
<p>At the GS-12 equivalent level:</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform the same duties as the GS-11 equivalent level but with less supervision, greater decision-making authority, and greater independence of action.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Program Manager will take direction from and will report to their respective OTI Regional Team Leader within the Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on assessment teams, Country Start-Ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Assessments, Country Start-ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC><p>The following are the questions that have been received and the government's response to them:</p>
<p>Question 1: We need any historical data on volumes of waste generated during cleanings at each facility so we can determine quantities of drums needed. We are assuming we will need to provide drums for waste containerization as per Section 1.3.6 of the Performance Work Statement even though Chapter 10, section 10.1.1 of OPLAN 19-3 states that "Drum or containers for wastes generated by servicing operations will be provided by the 673 CES/CEANQHWC as necessary."</p>
<p>Answer 1: This contract represents a new approach to the OWS service and maintenance work. Historically, the contractor, in the process of cleaning the OWS unit would remove all of the water, oil, and sludge together into a vacuum truck. This truck would then transport all material to one location and separate out phases for drying. Therefore, the material to be disposed of was a dry "cake-like" material with a low moisture content. Unfortunately, changes in the regulations now prevent us from continuing this process. As a result, the sludge that will have to be removed and drummed during cleanings will have a much higher moisture contain and thereby greater volume. As a result, we have no way of knowing the amounts/volumes that will be removed from each location.</p>
<p>Question 2: CLIN 0002 lists a quantity of 21, but for the base period (1 Jan 2012-30 Sep 2012) there are only four (4) months of "Seasonal OWS Cleanings" for the three (3) specified buildings for a total of twelve (12)?</p>
<p>Answer 2: This is correct because the base year has been reduced to a 9 month period.<br />Question 3: Please confirm the methodology that will be used to evaluate the bids for this scope of work and the work histories of prospective bidders.</p>
<p>Answer 3: Please refer to FAR ADDENDUM 52.212-2 (B) within the solicitation for clarification.</p>
<p>Question 4: Please explain the deviation of a 3-year requirement--especially given that the Government has historically required 5 years.</p>
<p>Answer 4: The past performance evaluation considers each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying products and services that meet requirement and it is in the best interest of the government. The government is changing the original 3 year past performance to 5 years.</p>
<p>Question 5: In the event, a contractor "teams" with another company with a higher level of experience in Oil/Water Separator maintenance, would that contractor get maximum benefit for the experience of the team if that contractor were to be the prime contractor on this project?</p>
<p>Answer 5: Please refer to FAR ADDENDUM 52.212-2 (B) within the solicitation for clarification. Total files size shall not exceed 4 MB.</p>
<p>Question 6: Since requiring experience in the past 3 years will preclude all local contractors from bidding this contract, would the Contracting Office consider experience in the past 5 years as being acceptable?</p>
<p>Answer 6: The government is changing the original 3 years past performance to 5 years. Please be sure to fully understand the Performance Work Statement; in that the methodology has changed significantly from what has been done in the past.</p>
<p>Question 7: The solicitation states that the price and past performance proposals should not exceed 25 pages - these forms are provided with the solicitation. (Ref pg. 40) Is there a page total on the Technical portion of proposal submittals?</p>
<p>Answer 7: The Technical portion of the proposal shall not exceed 25 pages.&nbsp; Total file size shall not exceed 4 MB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If hand carrying proposal on 5 or 6 December please deliver to Ms. Cindy Thompson in Suite 344.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.
  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:
	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.
	b.    is illegally present in the United States.
c.	   is subject to an outstanding warrant.
d.	   has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or                fradulent  information.
	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.

7.  Employee Identification:  Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer.
 

8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractors employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.

9.  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.

<DESC><strong>This is a Sources Sought notice.</strong> This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><strong><br />Background.</strong> The Comparative Medicine Branch (CMB) maintains the animal facility for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The health of the animals is a critical factor in many research projects. Laboratory animals are susceptible to many different diseases, which may be symptomatic or subclinical but still have profound effects on research. Some of the diseases can be zoonotic (contagious to humans). Diagnosis of these animal diseases is very important in maintaining the quality of the NIEHS research animals as well as ensuring the safety of the researcher and animal care staff. The CMB oversees the care and use of these animals. The Quality Assurance Laboratory (QAL), a laboratory within CMB, is responsible for monitoring the health status of incoming and resident animal colonies and making appropriate decisions based on the results of this monitoring. The animals used as sentinels for colony health status are evaluated by the QAL staff. This evaluation may include, as appropriate, a complete necropsy, examination for ecto and endo parasites, bacterial cultures, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and/or serological assays. Animals which appear ill or die are also submitted to the QAL for diagnostic services. The QAL is responsible for reporting the health status of the animal or tissue specimens back to the appropriate veterinarian(s) and researchers. <br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objective.</strong> The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain the services of a commercial laboratory for the serological analysis, PCR and related assay rodent sera, tissues, and fecal specimens used to monitor the health of NIEHS animal colonies. To provide a readily available source of Serology Assay Testing Services and PCR assays to meet the needs of the QAL and NIEHS. The overall objective is to provide serological testing and PCR assays for the diagnostic and health monitoring programs of the NIEHS. The specific objective is to have a Contractor receive serology samples, perform testing on these samples and report the positive and negative results.<br /><br /><strong>Project Requirements.</strong> <strong>(1)</strong> The scope of this requirement will be to perform the serology testing necessary to complete the animal health monitoring process. In addition to the serological testing, PCRs, may be requested to determine the presence of an agent in an animal facility or may be used in conjunction with serology as a method of health surveillance. Other assays, such as Western Blot or Immunofluorescent Antibody (IFA) may be requested to confirm initial positive serological results. <br /><strong>(2)</strong> The Contractor shall perform serological testing and/or PCR testing in accordance with good laboratory practices, and state of the art microbiological procedures. The number of tests requested per sample will depend upon species and the animal's history. <br /><strong>(3)</strong> Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services (except as otherwise specified herein) and perform the work set forth below.<br /><strong>(4)</strong> Based on what we feel is in the best interest of the Government the PCR and Serological services may be awarded in either one or two contracts. The serological assays, such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), Multiplex Fluorescent Immunoassay (MFI), IFA, Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) and Western Blot, may be awarded separately from the PCR assays for the presence of viral antigens in cell cultures, tissues, feces, and swabs.<br /><strong>(5)</strong> Serological Tests: <em><strong>(a)</strong></em> The Contractor shall, as a minimum, be prepared to perform serological assays by appropriate methods such as MFI, IFA, ELISA, and HAI, as appropriate. IFA and/or Western Blot methodology should be available for confirmatory testing. Should new testing technology become available or new pathogenic agents be discovered during the course of this offering, it will be incorporated through modification of the Contract.<br /><em><strong>(b)</strong></em> Rodent sera shall be processed (diluted 1.5 and heat inactivated at 56&deg;C for 30 minutes), frozen in 2 ml cryotubes labeled with the QAL's identification number and shipped in leak proof styrofoam containers with dry ice. The styrofoam container will be delivered to the Contractor by express overnight delivery service by NIEHS personnel. The Contractor shall receive the samples delivered by the express delivery service at the Contractor's own expense. Samples will be mailed by the Government on Wednesday afternoons at 4:00 p.m. with an anticipated arrival time and day of 10:00 a.m., Thursday of the following day of shipment. Sera shall be received at the Contractor's testing laboratory within twenty (20) hours following pickup. If the samples are not received within the designated timeframe the Contractor will contact the Government's Project Officer (PO) / Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) by phone for further instructions.<br /><em><strong>(c)</strong></em> The Contractor shall perform the appropriate tests requested by the QAL and provide the PO/COTR and the Contracting Officer (CO) with reports of the serological results within the following time periods:<br />The Contractor shall provide to the PO/COTR and CO by email or fax at the Contractor's expense the serological results within 3 working days from the date of receipt of the sera and a final written report within 10 working days.<br /><strong>(6)</strong> PCR Assays: <strong><em>(a)</em></strong> The Contractor shall be prepared to perform PCR assays for a variety of agents. Cell lines, tissues, fecal samples, and environmental swabs will be shipped in a leak proof, styrofoam container with dry ice.

<DESC>Synopses:
<p>The purpose of this notice is to comply with the synopses and pre-solicitation notice requirements of FAR 5.2 - Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions. Any solicitation resulting from this notice will be handled in accordance with FAR 5.102(d); therefore, availability of any resulting solicitation package may be limited to this electronic medium.</p>
<p>The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for anticipated multiple-award indefinite-quantity contracts (IQCs) for evaluation services restricted to South African local organizations (as defined below). Evaluation services will be performed in any of the following countries: South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland. Work under the IQCs will be delivered under Task Orders to perform evaluations that will serve two primary purposes: providing accountability to stakeholders and learning to improve aid effectiveness. All evaluations conducted under the IQCs will be unbiased in measurement and reporting, relevant in terms of linking evaluation questions to specific future decision to be made by USAID leadership, partner governments and other key stakeholders, based on best practices, oriented toward building local capacity and with a commitment to full and open disclosure of findings. Task Orders may include: 1) Problem diagnostics and analytics, 2) Problem identification, 3) Program/project/task design, 4) Analysis and assessment, 5) Strategic planning, 6) Technical Evaluations for Health, Democracy and Governance, Economic Growth, Environment, Education, 7) Contractor/ recipient performance evaluations, 8) Impact evaluations, 9) Partnership evaluations, 10) Development of metrics, 11) Performance monitoring and data quality assessments, 12) Assessments and analysis and 13) Provision of logistical support for task implementation teams.</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to be three (3) years. The maximum sum of all Task Orders awarded under all IQCs is anticipated to not exceed $5,000,000. Note that this ceiling applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate; each successful contractor will be eligible to compete on all Task Orders until the shared ceiling for all contracts is reached. There is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded, the number of Task Orders that any one firm will receive or the amount of money each contactor is entitled to beyond the minimum monetary amount stated in the anticipated Request for Proposals (RFP). USAID's preference is that Task Orders will be awarded on a firm fixed price basis.</p>
<p>Eligible organizations shall be limited to local organizations, defined as follows:</p>
<p>"Local Organization means an entity, that at the time of the award and performance of the contract or subcontract, is one that:</p>
<p>(1) is organized under the laws of the South Africa;<br />(2) has its principal place of business in South Africa; <br />(3) is not less than 51 percent legally and beneficially owned by one or more resident citizens of South Africa or is managed by a governing body, the majority of whom are citizens or lawful permanent residents of South Africa; and<br />(4) is not controlled by a foreign entity or by one or more individuals who are not resident citizens of the South Africa. "</p>
<p><br />Additionally, USAID wishes to notify potential offerors that USAID intends to hold a Pre-Proposal Conference.</p>
<p>Pre-Proposal Conference to be Held in Pretoria, South Africa</p>
<p>USAID/SA is planning on holding a pre-proposal conference in Pretoria, South Africa. This pre-proposal conference is for informational purposes only. At the conclusion of a presentation, attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions.

Due to high interest and space limitations, participation is limited to two (2) representatives per organization. Organizations must send their email and submit attendees names no later than January 1st, 2012.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wednesday, January 11th, 2012<br />10 AM to 12:00 PM (noon)</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF AWARD - SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT<br><br>Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager Constructive Simulations (ConSim) has a requirement to purchase licensing rights and a Software Development Kit (SDK) from Tapestry Solutions, Inc. to maintain the JDLM interface to the JLCCTC for a five-year period.  This effort is required for the design, development, integration, test, management, documentation, exercise support and training, and delivery/fielding of the JDLM software as the logistics component of the JLCCTC and US JFCOM J-7 (JWFC) Joint Live-Virtual-Constructive (JLVC) constructive training federations.  Tapestry Solutions, Inc. has sole proprietary rights to the software used in JDLM.  <br><br>JDLM was developed in 1998 to support U.S. Army Europe's then evolving role from Cold War defense to expeditionary force operations.  JDLM eventually became the U.S. Army and Marine Corps choice for high fidelity logistics simulations and training.  JDLM is in use at the Army logistics training center at Fort Lee, VA and is a crucial part of the JLCCTC.  JDLM is used to stimulate the Battle Command Support and Sustainment System (BCS3) currently fielded to U.S. Army units and is the only logistics model used with JLCCTC.<br><br>The Government has purchased the use of the JDLM license through a licensing agreement required for continued use of JDLM as part of the Army's training capability.  Additionally, the Government will purchase the SDK to provide the ability for JLCCTC development contractors to modify the JDLM software to meet JLCCTC and Army training requirements.<br><br>This effort will temporarily continue JDLM development and Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS), for a period not to exceed 12 months, to support ongoing training of the Army Corps, Divisions, and Brigades.  With the impending introduction of the Army's next generation logistics Mission Command System - Battle Command 10 - it is imperative that JDLM development and PDSS continue in order to ensure logistics simulation capability to support training.  Continued JDLM development and PDSS is imperative to ensure its viability as an effective Army training vehicle.  Future JDLM development and PDSS efforts will be executed under the future JLCCTC development contract that will be awarded as a full and open competition. <br> <br>AWARDED DOLLAR VALUE:  $2,368,658.06<br>

<DESC>NOTICE OF AWARD - SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT<br><br>Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager Constructive Simulations (ConSim) has a requirement to maintain the JDLM interface to the JLCCTC which entails design, development, integration, test, management, documentation, exercise support and training, and delivery/fielding of the JDLM software as the logistics component of the JLCCTC and US JFCOM J-7 (JWFC) Joint Live-Virtual-Constructive (JLVC) constructive training federations.  Tapestry Solutions, Inc. has sole proprietary rights to the software used in JDLM.  <br><br>JDLM was developed in 1998 to support U.S. Army Europe's then evolving role from Cold War defense to expeditionary force operations.  JDLM eventually became the U.S. Army and Marine Corps choice for high fidelity logistics simulations and training.  JDLM is in use at the Army logistics training center at Fort Lee, VA and is a crucial part of the JLCCTC.  JDLM is used to stimulate the Battle Command Support and Sustainment System (BCS3) currently fielded to U.S. Army units and is the only logistics model used with JLCCTC.<br><br>This effort will temporarily continue JDLM development and Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS), for a period not to exceed 12 months, to support ongoing training of the Army Corps, Divisions, and Brigades.  With the impending introduction of the Army's next generation logistics Mission Command System - Battle Command 10 - it is imperative that JDLM development and PDSS continue in order to ensure logistics simulation capability to support training.  Continued JDLM development and PDSS is imperative to ensure its viability as an effective Army training vehicle.  Future JDLM development and PDSS efforts will be executed under the future JLCCTC development contract that will be awarded as a full and open competition.   <br><br>AWARDED DOLLAR VALUE:  2,368,658.06<br> <br>RESPONSES REQUESTED:  No responses are required or requested.<br>
