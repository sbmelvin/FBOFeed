<SUBJECT>V -- New Commercial Air 2003 Program
<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Announcement:

The current air transportation contracts (ASYS-99-01 and ASYS-R-99-01) are scheduled to expire on May 30, 2003.  The commercial air transportation needs of the Postal Service will be fulfilled through a newly developed competitive process.  This is a significant departure from the current process of Negotiated Set Rate Contracting.  The new process will apply a best value approach to seek highly reliable air transportation services with an adequate number of capable suppliers, sufficient to provide coverage for the domestic air transportation network.  There will also be provisions for recognition of code share partners and subcontracting.  To be eligible to participate, a business entity (airline) will be required to:

?	Be a Certificated air carrier.
?	Have or certify that it will obtain, the necessary capability to scan USPS bar-coded mail pieces and transmit and receive such data to the Postal Service in accordance with the specifications in the solicitation.
?	Be in good standing in other areas of governmental purchasing, and must not appear on the Postal Service?s or General Services Administration?s (GSA) Debarred listings.

Of significant importance is the reality that the amount of mail transported on commercial aircraft has decreased since the fall of 2001.  This is due to several factors to include the events of 9-11 and cost initiatives of the Postal Service involving the effective use of surface transportation.

The mail volume currently transported via commercial air contracts is divided among over 50 suppliers.  In the realization that the reduced volume, spread over this number of suppliers has changed the value equation for both the suppliers and for the Postal Service.  The Postal Service and several of our suppliers have concluded that the current ?ASYS? purchasing approach should be improved upon; thus, the institution of new competitive procedures, which will be detailed in the solicitation.

The solicitation is in the final stages of development, and it will be issued electronically through the General Services Administration?s Electronic Posting System at http://www.eps.gov in the very near future.

Concurrently, a pre-proposal conference is being scheduled for mid-January.  Formal announcements of this event will also be posted in the Electronic Posting System. 
Sincerely,
