<DESC>Opportunity to license ORNL-developed method for making inorganic nanoparticles (particularly ferrites) using a highly scalable fermentative system. The IP portfolio contains US Patent 6,444,453 and two patents pending, along with selected bacterial cultures.

The process can be modified to produce single-crystal mixed oxide particulates with well-controlled sizes in the range of 10 to 100 nm.  In the case of ferrites, the particles are single-domain and demonstrate giant paramagnetism.  Many other metal oxide systems have been demonstrated as well.  Potential applications include ferrofluids, magnetorheological media, pigments and colorants, catalysts, microwave-absorbent materials, and others. In laboratory-scale tests using a 25-L fermenter, about 500 g of powder was synthesized in each run.  Pilot-scale experiments are presently being designed that we estimate will yield 10-20 kg of powder in each run.

The process may be conducted at or near room temperature but can also be conducted at elevated temperatures using thermophilic bacteria.  The higher temperature process is somewhat faster and more resistant to contamination from microorganisms from the air, because most cannot survive at the process temperature (65oC).  

Details of related publications and patents are available upon request.

The technology transfer process will be facilitated through licensing of UT-Battelle’s intellectual property, and subsequent development undertaken cooperatively between UT-Battelle and the licensee, funded by the licensee.     Such development will focus on transitioning the technology from the current pilot-scale demonstration stage to commercialization.     Interested companies with experience and expertise commensurate with the requirements of this commercialization effort are invited to respond to this announcement.     Companies interested in this opportunity may obtain more detailed technical information and a description of the licensing and cooperative research and development process by submitting a statement of interest, including a written description of their company and its activities and an explanation of their potential application of the technology.     No licensing intermediaries please. This is not a procurement activity.

Only Remote Sensing Solutions has developed these technologies to a sufficient level of maturity sufficient to provide a digital receiver subsystem and transceiver design for the HIWRAP. Sufficient proprietary data such as technical data packages, specifications, or engineering descriptions are not available to enable another vendor to provide system design, digital receiver and processor, and experiment design and analysis.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

As the coordinating unit at the National Library of Medicine for health services research and health data standards, NICHSR is responsible for assuring that major medical vocabularies and nomenclatures, including medical device nomenclature, are represented in the UMLS®.  ECRI has created and maintains the proprietary Universal Medical Device Nomenclature System (UMDNS), a standard international nomenclature and computer coding system for medical devices.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for purchasing Product Lifecycle Management Software and Implementation Services. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Softech, Inc., as the only known source who can meet the Agency's needs.  The purpose of this purchase of Product Lifecycle Management Software and Implementation Services is to design and install a web based electronic Aircraft Work Order (AWO) Process that will track all aircraft configuration changes in real time as well as create historical configuration data that will be used by flight and simulation. Using email notifications and customized user interfaces, users will be able to initiate, route and approve AWO’s in a much more streamlined fashion.  Consistency and full visibility will be ensured through the use of custom reports and electronic forms. Web based access, security, and revision control will be applied to all information that defines any AWO, including supporting information.  Selecting a different vendor would incur substantial cost for customization of interfaces and data base development, which has already been performed by another NASA Center, and is directly transferable to LaRC's application.  In addition, the purchase of this software will provide a streamlined process and provide a way to build upon established capabilities already being utilized. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 30, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

 Morocco: Olive Oil Waste Treatment Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a Feasibility Study on the treatment of olive oil wastes in Morocco. 

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has provided a grant to the Grantee, the Agence du Bassin Hydraulique du Sebou, to fund the cost of a Feasibility Study to conduct economic, technical, financial and regulatory analyses to develop the most appropriate technical solution for the treatment of olive oil waste in Morocco.  

The Agence du Bassin Hydraulique du Sebou, is under the supervision of the Moroccan Ministry of Environment and Water, Regional Planning.  It was created in 2002 as a publicly owned company equipped with an independent legal authority and financial autonomy.  Agence du Bassin Hydraulique du Sebou is responsible for the development and management of the hydraulic public domain of the Sebou River basin and regional water resources.  The company collaborates with the Moroccan National Office of Potable Water on issues concerning potable water, while, Agence du Bassin Hydraulique du Sebou maintains ultimate authority for the Sebou River watershed area.

The Government of Morocco has recently begun implementing stricter environmental laws to improve the country’s management of wastewater discharges in an effort to more effectively address water scarcity issues.  Enforcement actions have also been increased to comply with European Union (EU) environmental regulations, which require certification that exporters of food products meet strict standards for the treatment of wastewater.  Additionally, King Mohammed VI has ordered the cleanup of major industrial wastewater facilities in the north of the country.  In response to these actions, there is a concerted effort amongst the Moroccan private and public sector to comply with these requirements in order to get potable water to communities affected by water scarcity.  To provide potable water to these areas, the Government of Morocco is looking at technologies, such as nitrate removal, and desalinization.  These actions create significant opportunities for U.S. exporters of goods and services in the wastewater treatment sector, as the United States is the leader in tertiary wastewater treatment technologies.  The Government of Morocco has allocated funds to apply to infrastructure improvements in the wastewater treatment sector, such as the Olive Oil Waste Treatment project.  The U.S.-Morocco FTA also facilitates financing and eliminates costs associated with the implementation of this project.

Approximately 100 production facilities and 4,000 traditional processing units in the basin of the Sebou River produce olive oil on a seasonal basis by pressing semi-processed olives (which must be salted or otherwise treated in order to improve their palatability).  The semi-solid wastes, known as “margines,” which are left over as a result of this process amount to more than 2,000 tons of olive oil waste per day.  Presently the factories near Fès (in the north of Morocco) place the waste in holding ponds, which were designed to allow evaporation and then removal of the dried waste.  However, evaporation is not occurring, most likely because of the limited surface area of the ponds and the characteristics of the waste that both contribute to the creation of a large oil component, which remains with the waste.  This oil component forms a layer at the surface of the ponds, which seals in the waste and prevents evaporation.  Additionally, olive oil producers must transport their wastes to the ponds via trucks, but many producers do not comply with this regulation because it is not enforced and therefore a significant amount of margines are left completely untreated.

In both instances, with the waste brought to the ponds or with waste left untreated, the margines are extremely high in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), a measure of their ability to utilize oxygen in the receiving waters.  The consequences of the introduction of these wastes into the Sebeu River include damage to aquatic life and the contribution to the loss of the Sebeu River, the largest river in Morocco, as a source of drinking water.  These margines also have the potential to seriously disrupt the operation of a new wastewater treatment facility planned in Fès, Morocco.  The margines are but one of many sources of BOD and there is a strong need to start addressing these issues and begin to more effectively limit the level of BOD in waste products.

As mentioned above, the need to certify that Moroccan food product manufacturers meet strict standards for the treatment of wastewater in order to export to the EU is driving the private sector, which owns the olive oil manufacturing facilities, to address these issues.  The GOM, through the Agence du Bassin Hydraulique du Sebou, is acting as an umbrella group to oversea the management of this problem in particular, and the problems of the Sebou River in general.  This project represents a first step in addressing water issues on the Sebou River, which has had heavy pollution for many years and which has been identified for at least two decades as needing environmental management solutions.  This Feasibility Study would act as a blueprint for handling margines throughout the Sebou River watershed and for other margines-producing areas, such as Marrakech.  
The Olive Oil Waste Treatment project would improve environmental conditions in Morocco and promote optimal use of existing water resources.  Specifically, this project will result in the transfer of advanced waste management techniques such as biogas production, increased water efficiency, and improved productivity by reducing the need to treat this water before it is used for agricultural irrigation.  The project will also allow new industry sub-sectors to develop, including waste management services and biogas production systems.
This Feasibility Study would provide Agence du Bassin Hydraulique du Sebeu with consulting services on:  (1) Analytical overview of the Moroccan olive oil industry and the margines management systems currently employed; (2) Technical analysis; (3) Analysis of treatment methods to be utilized at the two pilot sites; (4) Implementation plan; (5) Regulatory review; (6) Economic analysis; (7) Financial analysis; (8) Environmental analysis; (9) Proposed goods and services; (10) Development impact assessment; (11) Develop bidding packages for each pilot site; (12) Provide direct assistance to strengthen Moroccan margines management capacities through education, public awareness, and inspections; and (13) Final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $322,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>The Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch (SS/SA) under the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has a requirement for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) to provide meeting space for a retreat workshop.  This requirement is being competed using FAR 13 procedures and quotations are being sought.  Reference Request for Quotations (RFQ) 60006.

The NINDS Intramural Retreat Workshop scheduled for April 19-21, 2006 is a conference meeting the criteria for training under the Government Employees Training Act (5 U.S.C. 410.404).  This training conference is for investigators and fellows of the intramural research program in an intimate and reflective atmosphere to foster interaction, exchange of ideas and group cohesiveness.  This training is a unique and essential annual program to keep intramural scientists abreast of recent scientific advances and techniques within the institute to enhance their own research, to encourage collaborations among scientists, and to stimulate initiatives that will translate from basic to clinical research.  

The program will consist of an intense two and a half day program with evening sessions by senior investigators and two outside speakers on research findings and techniques that cut across basic and clinical neuroscience research.   A poster session will be a focal point of the program to afford fellows an opportunity to showcase their research for critical exchange about research findings and methods.   Abstracts by fellows will be reviewed by senior faculty and four will be chosen for oral presentation thus giving fellows valuable experience in presenting research data in a scientific meeting.  Opportunities will be provided for informal interaction to encourage creative thinking and exchange of ideas among faculty and fellows. Outside speakers will present lectures on cutting edge science of interest to both the basic and clinical research community.   NINDS Extramural Program Directors will participate in order to inform fellows about extramural grant and career transition opportunities and processes and to discuss extramural career path issues.

<DESC>DESC: 6675-01-067-0687 and 1290-01-510-0540, Part Number 11785090 and 11834483, The item to procure is a M2A2 Aiming Circle  (Head Assembly)  - 11834483 The Aiming Circle consists of an elbow telescope mounted on orienting and elevating mechanisms which are contained within a main housing.  The main housing, in turn, is mounted on a tripod and provides precise measurements of a zimuth and elevation angles of a ground or aerial target through the use of azimuth and elevation scales.  The telescope is a low power, fixed focus instrument.  The elbow bend in the telescope makes it easier for the operator to use.  A mounting mechanism  provides the elbow telescope with unlimited azimuth movements and limited elevation movements.  The aiming circle can be used to shoot the sun for general topographical surveying.  An integral magnetic compass is used to orient the aiming circle to magnet ic north, therefore the entire construction of the aiming circle must be non-magnetic.  The Aiming Circle can also be oriented using stars with a reticle inside the elbow telescope.  The aiming circle mounts on the tripod head with leveling screws and leve l indicating vials.  The aiming circle consists of cast and precision machined components.  Two precision matched worms and wheels are also incorporated for azimuth and elevation movement.  The aiming circle is roughly 10 inches high by 6 inches in diamete r.  An aluminum dome cover is provided with two latches and a webbed carrying strap for ease of transport and protection. And M2A2 Aiming Circle (Complete)  11785090 The M2A2 Aiming Circle is fielded as a system consisting of the aforementioned head assembly and the following items:  Tripod, M51 Instrument Light, Plumb Bob and a Canvas Bag.  The Tripod consists of three wood en legs, adjustable in length, hinged to a flat tripod head.  The flat tripod head contains a screw assembly which secures the aiming  circle to it and provides a hook for hanging the plumb bob string.  The M51 Instrument Light contains 2 batteries, a rheo stat type switch and two wire cables each equipped with a specialized light.  The Plumb Bob consists of a pointed cylindrical weight with a nylon string and a slide adjuster.  The Canvas Bag contains pockets for storing the instrument light, plumb bob, and  a lamp extractor.  This bag is generally strapped to a leg of the tripod. Manufacture of these items will require the ability to precision machine worms and wheels and fit them as matched sets (lapping).  The ability to access cast and machined components made of brass and other non-metallic materials.  The ability to access opt ical workings or instruments and test ( i.e. azimuth test fixture and/or cross level fixture experience).    This solicitation is for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) five (5) year contract.  The guaranteed minimum quantities are 147 Each M2A2 Aiming Circle (Complete) and 370 Each M2A2 Aiming Circle (Head Assembly) to be divided evenly amongst al l awardees.

<DESC>Fort Hood Contracting Command is soliciting for its construction job order contract (JOC).  Construction services procured will be predominantly for the repair and maintenance of existing facilities, renovation of existing buildings, and minor new co nstruction projects not expected to exceed the installation Real Property Management Activity statutory limit.   This contracting activity anticipates awarding a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to a qualified Hubzone certified small  business.  The proposed JOC will consist of a base period (from date of award through one year), and two one-year option periods.  The Government reserves the right to make subsequent awards from this solicitation for up to six months following initial aw ard.  The guaranteed annual minimum amount for the base period will be $750,000.00.  The guaranteed amount for any option periods exercised will be $375,000.00.   Task orders will be negotiated by project, as individual firm fixed-price contracts.  The gen eral scope of work consists of managing multiple projects from development to completion.  All contract management, all quality control management, and a percentage of trades will be performed by in-house resources.   The scope of work being procured inclu des, but is not limited to: providing and constructing site built pre-engineered metal buildings; parking lots; fencing and security lighting;  asbestos abatement; mold remediation; demolition and clearing; site preparation; all utilities; entrance drivewa ys and sidewalks; roofing; mechanical systems, to include fire alarm and fire suppression systems; heating and air conditioning systems; and electrical distribution systems.  The Contractor will be responsible for obtaining, maintaining and operating an in dustry standard computer system, capable of creating electronic as-built drawings, and completion of required construction and contract documentation on line and in standard Military formats.  All work performed under the JOC will be ordered by issuance of  individually negotiated task orders.  The Fort Hood Directorate of Public Works utilizes the R.S. Means Estimating System in the development of its work projects.  All of the Means database as it relates to this JOC will be used in the development of proj ect proposals.  The Government will implement updated versions of Means on an annual basis, thereby eliminating the use of an Economic Price Adjustment Clause in the contract.  The Contractor will be required to acquire rights/licenses for this software to  participate in this acquisition.   The magnitude of the proposed procurement is estimated to be more than $50,000,000.00, base period and options included.

No paper copies of this solicitation are available.  All responsible sources submitting viable proposals shall be considered for award.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Minerals Management Service has received several questions regarding the apparent overlap between Topic 3 and Topic 6 in the original announcement posted on November 30, 2005.  To clarify, Topic 3 simply requests hindcast data for wind, wave, and current conditions through the water column with a relatively short delivery schedule.  Topic 6 may include the scope of work under Topic 3; however, should also include advanced work such as simulation of circulation of surface currents and circulation throughout the water column; response of currents and waves; determination of the length of time for which substantial ocean response to these hurricanes persisted; and determination of areas of greatest wave height and current speed.  Topic 6 required more complex analyses, thorough discussion and extensive scholarly interpretation of findings with a longer delivery schedule.  The due date for receipt of responses remains unchanged.

Per AAFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.
The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. 
Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

The bid closing date has been extended to 02/08/2006 at 02:00 pm MST. This project involves operation and maintenance of rock-block monitoring equipment installed on the Mount Rushmore sculpture.  The intention in advertisement is to award a base-year contract with the option to renew the period of service for four additional years.  A total of five years. This work includes the review and interpretation of electronically produced and collected data to determine if: 1) all components are operating properly, and 2) interpreting block movement.  This data is collected from 36 transducers and documented in report form semi-annually and made available to the National Park Service (NPS).  The analysis of the data will be provided to the designated Contracting Officers Representative (COR) for this project.  Sampling will be performed often enough to determine if the readings change significantly, as specified in the contract. The Contractor will perform the repair and maintenance of the data collection system in its entirety.  It is expected that some of the required maintenance functions will include gauge retrieval from the Sculpture, gauge calibration and reinstallation, instrument inspection and equipment replacement.  At a minimum, 25% of the transducers will be recalibrated annually.  Each instrument will be checked annually for alignment and tightness of fasteners.  Cables, connections, and protective enclosures will also be inspected annually and repaired/replaced as required.  This is a firm, fixed-price contract for a period of one year, with four, one year renewable options. Contract renewal options will depend on successful performance and availability of funding. This contract will be an Evaluated Procurement.  Proposals will be evaluated based on best value to the government.   Evaluation factors are past performance, technical expertise, key personnel and cost.  All evaluation factors other than price or cost, when combined, are significantly more important than price or cost.  Past performance factors will be evaluated on the proposed project team's recent experience in performing similar type work, references from the past five years will be required.  Technical expertise factors will be evaluated on the proposed project team's knowledge and experience in rock block monitoring systems similar to the one installed at Mount Rushmore NM, including monitoring and maintaining installed equipment; gathering and interpreting data; understaning of computer hardware and software in procesing the data.  Other technical factors are the team's certifcation in industrial rope access/rappelling and ability to work independently without supervison by NPS staff.  Key personnel factors will be evaluated on the proposed project team's education and qualifications related to geotechnical and rock mechanics as they apply to granite formations, as well as the aforementioned rock climbing abilities.  (40% past performance/30% technical expertise/20% key personnel/10% price or cost/100 points possible).  Proposals must be submitted on government provided forms only.  This project is subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965.  The magnitude of this project over five years is between $250,000 and $500,000.  NAICS: 541690, P&S: B519.  This solicitation will be available ONLY on the Department of Interior (DOI) website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.

<DESC>Stratton VAMC is seeking Broadband/LAN connection services. These services are DS3 transport, CoLocation, and 100 Mbps Dedicated Ethernet Connectivity between 113 Holland Ave, Albany, NY and the CoLocation facility, which must be within a 12 mile radius of the Stratton’s Holland Ave location.   VISN 2 will not consider breaking out these services separately. The purpose of this network is to provide redundancy from the existing facilities at 113 Holland Avenue in Albany, NY. Therefore the local Fiber demark at 113 Holland Ave, Albany NY to support the DS3 Transport and 100M Ethernet Connectivity must be completely independent of the existing facilities currently provided by the LEC.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY FOR PURPOSES OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICIATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  

The Missile Defense Agency is conducting market research to determine the extent of small business sources capable of performing as prime contractors for the Office of the Deputy for Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (SADBU) (MDA/SB) for two efforts currently contemplated for future procurements. One effort supports the MDA Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technical Transfer (STTR) Programs by providing 7-9 man-years of effort and the other effort provides administrative and technical support for the MDA SADBU office; the MDA Mentor-Protégé and Historically Black College and Universities/Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) Programs; and the MDA Small Business Outreach Program by providing 3-4 man years of effort. The SBIR/STTR Support requirements include: (1) Developing and maintaining a web-based SBIR database which contains evaluation and debriefing functions and which allows for various data collection functions to enhance SBIR/STTR program management and Department of Defense (DoD) reporting requirements; (2) Producing various required DoD and MDA SBIR and STTR reports; (3) Maintaining and producing various financial reports for the MDA SBIR/STTR program offices; (4) Providing a SBIR/STTR help desk function for MDA two-letter and program offices; (5) Providing administrative support to the MDA SBIR/STTR Program Office; and (6) Planning and conducting a SBIR/STTR outreach program to identify and provide information to potential small businesses which have the capability to participate in MDA’s SBIR and STTR programs and coordinating the outreach effort with the MDA SADBU Outreach Program.  The effort to support the MDA SADBU Office includes: (1) Planning and conducting an MDA SADBU Outreach Program to identify and provide information to small businesses that have the capabilities needed to support the management, development and fielding of the Ballistic Missile Defense System. This includes the development and production of outreach materials and the planning and conduct of outreach efforts at various conferences and information forums around the country; (2) Planning and executing of the annual MDA Small Business Day, a conference for over 300 persons in the Washington, D.C. metro area; (3) Maintaining data on MDA’s performance on various small business programs and preparing various required MDA and DoD reports related to that performance; (4) Providing administrative support to the MDA Mentor-Protégé and HBCU/MI Programs; (5) Developing and maintaining a web based, keyword searchable database of small businesses, which allows small businesses to enter their capabilities and allows MDA SADBU and Program Offices access to key word searches on those capabilities; and (6) Providing a liaison to the MDA Contracting Deputate (MDA/CT) in order to identify upcoming MDA contracting requirements, stay abreast of developing MDA contracting policy and provide general knowledge exchange of small business capabilities with MDA/CT personnel.

MDA intends to make both these future procurements small business set-asides of some type. Teaming arrangements and joint ventures will also be considered for these procurements as long as the prime contract is awarded to an applicable small business and that small businesses provide fifty percent or more of the support. The information provided in response to the SOURCES SOUGHT announcement will be used to finalize the acquisition strategy for these requirements including determining what type of specific small business set-aside will be used.  All small business concerns are required to submit Capability Statements containing the following information: (1) Evidence of the ability to provide services (in whole or in part) similar in scope and complexity to the above requirements; (2) Past performance information demonstrating relevant past experience in any of the functional task areas referenced above within the past five years; (3) Identification of contracts with total dollar values over $1 Million within the past five years, by description of relevant services performed, dollar value, contract number, point of contact with telephone number, and if they were prime or subcontractors on the referenced contracts; (4) Gross annual receipts for the past three years; and (5) Identification of small business category and/or Socio-economic group.  The anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541611; small business size standard is $6 Million.  THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY TOOL. INTERESTED SMALL BUSINESSES MAY ALSO SUBMIT SUGGESTIONS FOR ALTERNATE NAICS CODES THAT MAY HAVE APPLICABILITY TO THE AFOREMENTIONED REQUIREMENTS.

<SUBJECT>16 -- F1WHEELSPEED1
<DESC>Notice of Contract Action for a Sole Source Procurement

SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR  Wheel Speed and Hubcap Assembly.  The assembly consists of the items as listed:  30 each - P/N 140-285, Wheel Speed Transducer, and 30 each – P/N 140-28530, Hubcap.

DESC: INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT WITH ELDEC Corporation; doing business as Crane Aerospace & Electronic.  The Air Force, Edwards Air Force Base, CA intends to award a Sole Source purchase order to Crane Aerospace & Electronic, 16700 13th Ave W., Lynnwood, WA 98037-8503.  The Sole Source purchase will be for the following one (1) commercial item: Wheel Speed and Hubcap Assembly


Description:	The function of the entire assembly is to sense wheel speed at landing to prevent skid on a runway by communicating with an on-board control unit that monitors brake application pressure.  Other salient characteristics are described below:

Two wheel-speed transducers provide individual wheel velocity measurement for each of the braked wheels. The transducers have axle adapters to allow them to be mounted inside the axles.  The transducer-adapter assembly is secured by threaded fasteners protruding through the axle and castellated wheel axle nuts.  The transducer shaft extends from the transducer toward the hubcap.  On the shaft, a drive coupling is installed, which is driven by the hubcap drive mechanism.  The field-proven hubcap-transducer drive interface is of sufficient rotational stiffness and strength to prevent transmission of erroneous wheel-speed velocity signals.  The coupling design can accommodate angular and parallel misalignment and axial assembly tolerance without degradation such as premature bearing or drive coupling wear.  The transducer is a variable reluctance alternator with 36 poles (teeth) on the rotor with 36 matching poles (teeth) on the stator.  The magnetic field is provided by a coaxial coil energized by the control unit transducer bias current.  With the excitation applied, a static magnetic field is established between the north and south poles of the rotor, air gap, stator and return path iron of the transducer, and no output is produced.  As the wheel rotates, rotor teeth pass the stator slots and teeth, causing variations in the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, which causes a change in the flux linking the coil.  The transducer output is, therefore, a sinusoidally varying voltage, with a frequency directly proportional to wheel rotational velocity.

Transducer Weight:  The weight of the wheel-speed transducer is 1.1 pounds.  The weight will be further defined after final axle adapter design.  The transducer weight does not include the weight of the hubcap, which is included in the total system weight estimate.  The proposed wheel-speed transducer is similar to Hydro-Aire 36-tooth wheel-speed transducers used on numerous commercial, business and military aircraft.





  ELDEC Corporation, doing business as Crane Aerospace & Electronic, is the only known source that can satisfy the requirements of the Government at this time.

Please note that this is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the Wheel Speed and Hubcap Assembly. .   Responses may be sent via e-mail to kim.rabatin@edwards.af.mil or mailed to 412TW/PKDD, 5 South Wolfe Ave, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Attention: Kimberly Rabatin.  Fax Number: 661-275-7862.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.  If the office has not received any affirmative written responses by Close of Business (COB), 10 Jan 2006, a Sole Source purchase order will be pursued with ELDEC Corporation; doing business as Crane Aerospace & Electronic.  16700 13th Ave W., Lynnwood, WA 98037-8503.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) requires a consultant to assist in administering its Assessment Center Program.  The Bureau enforces federal laws and regulations relating to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, explosives and arson.  In November 1990, a lawsuit was filed in United States District Court on behalf of all ATF African-American special agents.  The parties reached a settlement agreement approved by the court.  Among the requirements of the agreement was that ATF would implement a promotion assessment system based on job analysis, and OPM/EEOC guidelines.  ATF implemented a promotion plan that includes Promotion Assessment Centers (ACs).  Bureau managers and senior supervisors (known as subject matter experts or SMEs) design the AC exercises.  Attendees receive profiles rating their performance in each competency.  ATF holds one AC a year, rewriting all of the exercises for each AC.  ATF needs to hire a contractor with expertise in the field of industrial/organization development to assist ATF in the design and administration of the ACs, securing SMEs within ATF to work on exercise design, overseeing exercise design workshops and giving final approval to all AC exercises, obtaining assessors from other directorates in ATF, reviewing and approving all assessor training material, approving all AC administrative material that goes to AC participants, reviewing and approving all AC schedules and serving as the on-site administration at all ACs.  Timely provision of these services will provide ATF with the support required so that the Bureau can continue to deliver a valid promotion system that meets all governing regulations, industry standards and is in full compliance with the court-approved settlement agreement.  The contactor will serve as the subject matter expert/consultant on the Bureau’s AC Program, and shall provide recommendations for the administration of the Program, in consultation with ATF’s AC Program Director.  The performance period shall be 12 months from the date of award of the contract plus four one-year options.

ATF’s AC Director will monitor the contractor’s performance and will be responsible for reviewing and accepting all deliverables.  The contractor will perform all tasks necessary to ensure that the following activities are completed in a timely fashion:  1) Finalizing AC scores, including if necessary, coordinating meetings to determine critical competencies and to review AC statistics.  This work will be completed in month 1; 2) Overseeing the issuance of AC scores and conducting the AC pilot test (for current calendar year’s AC).  This work will be completed in month 2; 3) Overseeing Exercise Development Workshop # 1 (for the following calendar year’s AC).  This work will be completed in month 3; 4) Ensuring the opening of the AC Vacancy Announcement and reviewing the results of the AC pilot test.  This work will be completed in month 4; 5) Overseeing Exercise Development Workshop # 2.  This work will be completed in month 5; 6) Conducting the AC location visit.

The AC Director will establish due dates for each of the above activities.  While the contractor will be required to perform all of the task/deliverables outlined above, the AC Director may adjust the time frame for each deliverable.  The AC Director will provide the contractor at least 30 days notice of any change in the schedule or deliverable due dates.  The AC Director or his/her designee must approve all travel required for any of the above described tasks or deliverables in advance.  The contractor will be required to travel to Washington D. C. and Alexandria, VA to complete many of the deliverables outlined below.  It is anticipated that a minimum of 10 trips, approximately one-week each, will be required.  In addition, the contractor will be required to make at least one trip each year, approximately one-week in length, to secure an appropriate location/facility in which to conduct the AC, and then travel for up to two weeks in connection with the administration of the AC.  Additional travel may be required to meet the needs of the Government, as determined by the AC Director.  All travel requires advanced approval by the AC Director or his/her designee.  Travel costs will be reimbursed on a per diem basis, in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations, with receipts to be provided by the contractor as required by the Federal Travel Regulations.

The contractor will not do root pruning, top pruning or culling, unless authorized by the Forest Service.  If it should appear that any of these treatments are necessary, the conditions should be reported to the Forest Service.  If any root pruning is done, a sharp cutting instrument and a cutting board will be used.  The Forest Service will determine the minimum root length required to be maintained.  FIELD HANDLING   -  Trees in possession of planter will be handled in accordance with the following:  Trees in planting bags or trays will have only their tops exposed.  Root systems will be kept moist at all times by use of burlap, wet leaves, moss, or other moisture retaining material.  Trees will not be removed from planting bag or tray until the planting hole has been prepared.  Seedlings will be gently removed, one at a time, to prevent striping or other injury, and quickly inserted into the planting hole.  Seedlings carried in planting bags or trays will not exceed the amount that can be carried and removed without injury, or which can be planted out and not returned to storage.  Materials used by the planting contractor to keep tree roots moist in planting boxes or other containers and to shelter supplies of trees in his custody must meet the approval of the Forest Service representative.  The contractor will have only three bundles of trees opened at any one time.  All the trees in these bundles will be planted before another bundle is opened.  The contractor may have five bundles open at a time if approved in writing by the Forest Service and then only for sufficient cause.  PLANTING SPECIFICATIONS:  Trees will be planted in spots distributed over the area at the intervals prescribed.  The average spacing may be varied as much as 25 percent in any direction to find a suitable planting spot.  Where a planter encounters an unplantable spot, he will plant in the closest suitable spot; however, average spacing will be maintained.  The contractor will observe good planting practices, such as planting each tree in the best available spot with the space limits; avoiding places such as animal burrows; rotten wood;  rock existing trees or shrubs, etc.  HOLE PREPARATION:  planting holes will be located near the center of the spot in a near vertical position.  An open hole deep enough to fully accommodate the root of the tree.  CLEARING:  Before planting, all debris within six (6) inches of each planting spot will be removed.  Debris to be removed includes sod, leaf litter, duff, and rotten wood.  TREE PLACEMENT:  Trees will be suspended near the center of the hole with roots in a natural arrangement at a depth that after closing the hole, firming  and leveling the soil, the soil comes to a point even with the original ground line of the tree (root collar).   The root collar must be at or slightly below the ground line.  A tolerance of 1 inch below ground line will be accepted.    No portion of the root should be exposed nor any branches covered with soil.  The roots will not be doubled, twisted, spiraled, or bunched.  The central stem of the tree must be vertical with the roots extending downward.  Firming the Tree - The planting hole will be closed with mineral soil and firmed so that the tree is as firmly planted as soil conditions will allow.  Dry soil, organic matter, rock and other foreign material will be kept out of the hole.  Soil will be firmed so that no loose soil or air pockets remain.  Planting must be done in a manner that assures that the tree and root system are not damaged.  The tree will be left in free-to-grow situation.  LIMITATION AND PROTECTION:  All refuse resulting from the contractor's operations will not be left in an exposed or unsanitary condition and will be removed from National Forest lands.  The contractor will protect improvements, such as roads, telephone lines, power lines,  pipelines, oil wells, storage tanks and land survey monuments, corners, and bearing trees.  Do not plant within 15 feet of roads, powerlines, telephone lines or pipelines.  The contractor's operation will be conducted to minimize soil erosion.  Equipment will not be operated when ground conditions are such that excessive damage, such as rutting, will result.  The contractor will be required to repair to the original condition any alteration or damage to the access road or erosion control device.  General safe working conditions will be adhered to by the contractor.  INSPECTION :  The Government will inspect planting to determine compliance with specifications and to provide the basis for computing the rate of payment.  Inspection will consist of intermittent and/or continuous observations of tree handling, and planting procedures while work is underway, and examination of individual trees and planting spots on sample plots.  The plots will be located throughout the planting areas so as to obtain a representative sample of the work.  Each area will be inspected separately and inspection results will not be combined with other areas.  Determination of the acceptability of the work performed will be based on these inspections,  which will be considered conclusive, except as otherwise provided in the contract.  The contractor or his representative is encouraged to observe inspections while they are underway.  Care of Trees - On-going operations will be inspected to assure compliance with the specifications.  Planting Quality - Planting procedures will be observed and planted seedlings on representative sample plots will be examined to assure and measure compliance with specifications.  PLOT PROCEDURE  - Sample plots will be examined as follows:  The Inspector will take a series of  plots sufficient in number to yield at least a one percent sample of the number of trees planted.  Plots will be distributed uniformly over the entire planting area.  Inspection within each plot will be done as follows:  Locate plot on the ground.  Determine the number of trees in the plot based on the specified spacing.  This could vary due to ground condition and acceptable existing trees within the specified spacing allowances.  Inspect and record the number of planted trees that do not meet the contract specifications.  Compute the planting quality by use of the following formula:  Total planted correctly divided by total sample equals percent planted correctly.  Percentage of planting quality as calculated above will be rounded up to the nearest whole percent.  Upon completion of each item, the contractor may request in writing, a final evaluation of planting on that item.  The evaluation results for the item will be made available within (3) days of receipt of the contractor's request.  REINSPECTION UPON CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST :  If the original inspection results are unacceptable to the contractor,  a re-examination may be requested.  Requests for reinspection must be made in writing within five (5) days after receipt of notice of initial inspection results.  The same inspection procedure will be used but new plots will be selected.  The inspection pattern will be shifted so new inspection plots will not overlap previously inspected plots.  PAYMENT:  Payment, less deduction for wasted trees, will be made for completed units of work at the unit contract price.  For all units of work where the quality of work is less than 95 percent,  the contractor will have deducted from his contract price that percentage of unsatisfactory planting.  For example:  Inspection indicated a planting quality of 84 percent.  The Government will deduct 16 percent from the contract price for that particular item (100 - 84 = 16).  Where quality falls below 90 percent,  the Contractor will be informed in writing of the deficiencies and of the necessary action for him to take to correct those deficiencies.  If corrections are not made and the planting brought up to an acceptable standard  (95 percent or above) within two days after notification,  all work will be suspended.  If 25 percent or more of the trees are incorrectly planted in specific locations of one or more acres in size,  the contractor will be required to replant that area at his own expense.

Specifications for Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA)

The dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) instrument to be purchased shall be based on the standard platform that uses a direct-drive linear motor to apply the strain and a separate Force Rebalanced Transducer (FRT) to measure the force.  Instruments that combine the motor (M) and transducer (T) into a single assembly (CMT design) will not be considered.  To ensure optimal measurement sensitivity, the FRT shall incorporate low friction air bearings.  The instrument shall also use a forced convection oven to permit precise temperature control using liquid and gaseous nitrogen from -150 degrees C to 600 degrees C.

Therefore the successful instrument shall meet or exceed the following minimum requirements:


Detail Specifications:

Instrument Platform ¡V General Design Requirements
(1)	DMA design shall utilize separate, isolated DC servo actuator (motor) and Force Rebalance Transducer (FRT).
(2)	Shall employ steel frame design.
(3)	For safe operation instrument shall have ¡§emergency off¡¨ switches for both the oven and the motor on the test frame to enable immediate termination of instrument operation.

Actuator and Force-Rebalance Transducer Requirements
(4)	Actuator:  The DC servo actuator mentioned above shall be a direct drive, DC servo-motor that commands both strain and strain rate (i.e., not a CMT design):
i.	In strain control mode the actuator shall generate dynamic strain amplitudes from 0.5 to 1,500 micrometers with a displacement resolution of 1 nanometer
ii.	In stress relaxation mode the actuator shall be capable of performing a true step-strain (stress relaxation) experiment, without the use of a feedback control loop or a user-input modulus/viscosity target.  The actuator shall be capable of providing less than 10 msec rise time to 99 percent of a 10 micrometer step-displacement
iii.	In frequency range mode, the actuator shall be capable of generating a range of frequencies between 2x10-5 to 80 Hz.  This should be accomplished in no less than 50,000 discreet steps with a resolution to within 0.10 percent of commanded frequency.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS 53415099 REMOTE POWER RACKING DEVICE FOR LOWER GRANITE LOCK AND DAM 1.0	INTENT The following specifications pertain to the purchase of a remote power racking device  for use on 4160 VAC DHP-VR power circuit breakers at Lower Granite Lock and Dam. 2.0	SCOPE The successful bidder shall be required to fabricate and deliver a remote power  racking device to Lower Granite Dam by the date shown in Section 9.  The successful  bidder shall also provide training, documentation, and other items as stated in the  specifications.   3.0	REMOTE RACKING DEVICE The remote power racking device shall be a Eaton brand rackout device Or Approved  Equal.  It shall be designed to completely rack out and rack in a DHP-VR  4.0	GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS The Eaton Electrical Remote Power Safety Racking device system provides an  innovative means of inserting and removing a power circuit breaker in metal  clad and metal enclosed switchgear, while allowing personnel to be outside of  the calculated  Arc Flash danger limits as defined by NFPA 70E.   All  breakers being considered for Remote Power Racking must have some method of  levering that can be operated by the rotational motion of a drive system  (Screw or gear-drive racking).  If one of these type systems does not exist,  then the breakers and cells must be modified to add one of these levering  features before any remote power racking system can be applied.  The Remote  Power Racking System may be used with the switchgear door either open or in  many cases with the door closed. The Eaton Remote Power Safety Racking system does not require complex  programming that is normally associated with programmable logic controller  (PLC) based systems.  This eliminates cumbersome programming (re- programming), extensive training, and the creation and modification of torque  profiles each time a breaker is moved between different cells.  This also  simplifies maintenance.  A few entries into a key pad and the unit is set for  operation. It is also much easier to apply and opera te than other designs.  Positioning  the Remote Power Safety Racking System in front of each cell is as simple as  moving a hand truck.  The Remote Power Safety Racking System also has an  onboard height adjustment system that does not require auxiliary motors for  operation.  Height adjustment is fast, easy, and virtually maintenance free.   Many breakers require positive pressure on the levering systems to maintain  engagement and must traverse horizontally.
