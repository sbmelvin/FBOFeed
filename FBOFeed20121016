All interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make the determination to set aside all, part, or none of this procurement, the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify: Type of services provided by your firm, Size and type of services provided by   previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance), Number of years in business
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
All responses to this market survey must be received by 31 October 2012, 15:00 Central Time.   All submittals should be submitted to:

<DESC>The FAA Technical Center intends to issue a single source modification to Contract DTFACT-09-D-00017 with FJ Leonelli Group to increase the ceiling hours and the dollar ceiling in accordance with AMS 3.3.1-5.
The contract was awarded as a single source procurement in September 2009, with a period of performance through September 2014; however, the ceiling of the hours awarded is not sufficient enough to provide for the requisite services for the remainder of contact performance.  It would be cost prohibitive to create a new contract, as the services provided under this contract have now been provided for several years and are safety research specific.   In addition, a new contract would have a negative time impact on continuity of the services being provided.
If your company disagrees with the FAA's intention to issue a modification to the aforementioned contract to increase the labor hour ceiling and the dollar ceiling must submit their position to the Contracting Officer no later than close of business October 19, 2012.  The email address for the cognizant Contracting Officer is Lori.McLaughlin@faa.gov.
No phone calls, please.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address  NASA Shared Services Center Procurement Division Building 1111 Stennis Space Center, MS 39529-6000 Description NASA/NSSC intends to issue a sole source contract modification to LeGacy Resource, Brentwood, TN 37027-2201 for Agency-wide contract closeout services.  The period of performance includes a one month base period. NASA recently conducted acquisition procedures including receiving proposals, evaluation of proposals, and selection of a successful Offeror for the follow-on contract, Agency-wide Contract Closeout and Procurement Support Services.  Immediately following the award of the Phase-In purchase order, a protest was received.	The protest has now been settled. NASA/NSSC now plans to award a 60 phase-in contract with an effective date of December 1, 2012 and a new Agency-wide Contract Closeout and Procurement Services Contract with an effective date of February 1, 2013.  Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, the acquisition of these services has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.	In order to maintain the current level of contract performance and continuity of services during a short transition period, it is in the best interest of NASA to award on a sole source basis.  The current contractor has sustained operations in place to perform, as required, month-to-month at all NASA Centers.   The management and staff are familiar with processes and procedures currently being performed, therefore providing essential continuity without the potential of disrupting services. 2.	It is not feasible or realistic to conduct a competitive acquisition to cover such a short period due to the requirement for a 60 day phase-in to adequately cover required transition activities.     The period of performance for this contract action is: Base period:	Jan 1  Jan 31, 2013 This contract will require on-site performance of closeout services at 10 NASA Centers. The services will include closeout support services for all types of NASA procurement instruments in accordance with the FAR, NFS, and other related guidance. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. central standard time on October 31, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Capabilities and qualifications should be submitted to Lewis R. Hansen at lewis.r.hansen@nasa.gov NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. Contact information for the installation Ombudsman can be obtained at: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) has a need to procure a Modified Over Ground Access Sensor (OGAS) locator system suitable for Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Special Operations Forces (SOF), and Naval SOF (NAVSOF), dismounted operations.   An OGAS is required to provide visual and electronic detection to SOF/NAVSOF as they conduct countermine efforts.    Most Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) OGAS locator systems currently in use by EOD forces are designed for Humanitarian Demining (HD); therefore, these detectors are not intended for dismounted operations.  Speed and mobility are integral to the countermine mission.  No capability is currently available in a handheld form factor that can detect/locate and provide the data needed to allow the EOD and NAVSOF/SOF operators to avoid Low Magnetic Content (LMC)/No Magnetic Content (NMC) objects.
  Market research indicates that current COTS OGAS locators could be redesigned with less weight and size for dismounted operations without losing capability.  This requirement is for a  modified COTS locator system to meet the requirements of the OGAS locator system and deliver to the Government for testing and user assessment.  Additional specifications will be available with the solicitation.
A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  This requirement will be a small business set-aside.  The contract will include three phases for the following:
Phase I:  The Government intends to award two awardees for Phase I for 4 Prototypes. 
Phase II: The Government will select one of the two Prototypes awardees to enter Phase II for 10 Production Representative Model (PRM)/Production Systems (Option)
Phase III: System Delivery (Option of 50 Units upon approval of the First Article testing).

This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. There will be no reimbursement for the information provided. <br />The PATS (Portable Automated Test System) group of the 516 SXMS/MXDED is building test systems for O-Level maintenance and repair. The O-Level environment can consist of using the PATS in exposed outside weather conditions. Because of the exposed outside weather conditions, the operator's PC tablet must also meet the same exposed weather conditions as the PATS. Because of this requirement, the ruggedized PC tablet pushed a unique design requirement for the PATS. Not only is there a very specific form factor that is required to fit/latch into the PATS PC carriage, but there is a unique external pinout for power connection between the PATS to PC tablet and a unique very specific modification that is required before fielding of the PATS. The modification is done as per PC tablet technical drawing package. Touch labor is required to implement the modification prior to PATS fielding. This modification was designed to the specific PC tablet form factor. The Attachment PC Tablet Specs Draft lists the required assets to be procured under a contract with their necessary corresponding requirements. Any deviation from the assets listed in the Attachment PC Tablet Specs Draft is prohibited due to meeting customer exposed weather condition requirements, unique PC tablet form factor that drove a design requirement of the PATS, and unique PC tablet modification that is specific to the PC tablet form factor as well. <br />The PATS is a major O-level maintenance and repair program for the USAF. This activity will procure the assets necessary to repair and maintain current Electronic Environmental Systems, Weapon Systems and Avionics on various weapon platforms to insure on sight mission readiness. <br />

The O-Level environment can consist of using the PATS in exposed outside weather conditions. In the exposed outside weather conditions, self-test of the PATS is required to ensure proper functionality. To aid the PATS self-test functionality, cable wrap-around components are needed. These cable wrap-around components are required to have high reliability in these exposed weather conditions. Attachments Self-Test Wrap-Around Draft 201226995 and Self-Test Wrap-Around Draft 201227000 are examples of typical self-test assemblies that need to be procured under a contract with their necessary corresponding requirements. There will be 17 different self-test type assemblies and we'll need 54 each of all 17 different assemblies. Any deviation from the example drawings in Attachments Self-Test Wrap-Around Draft 201226995 and Self-Test Wrap-Around Draft 201227000 is prohibited due to meeting customer exposed weather condition requirements and MTBF requirements. The drawings in Attachments Self-Test Wrap-Around Draft 201226995 and Self-Test Wrap-Around Draft 201227000 are just examples of two of the 17 configurations. The other 15 drawings will be released with the Request for Quotation (RFQ).<br />The PATS is a major O-level maintenance and repair program for the USAF. This activity will procure the assets necessary to repair and maintain current Electronic Environmental Systems, Weapon Systems and Avionics on various weapon platforms to insure on sight mission readiness. <br />

<DESC>This notice is a request for information (RFI) and is not a request for proposals (RFP). The government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released. In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
<p>This is a FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT requesting technology information on rapid sample-to-sequence genomic sequencing systems.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The Research and Technology Directorate under Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) is seeking market research and potential sources for available commercial sample preparation and genomic sequencing systems. Platforms of particular interest are those that support rapid sample processing, sequence-ready nucleic acid preparation, and whole genome shotgun sequencing read output, all with minimal human intervention (i.e., "Sample-to-sequence"). The scope of the information being sought covers the processing and sequencing of unknown aqueous clinical and aqueous environmental samples to identify viral and/or bacterial components. This RFI does not support the development of such a system but seeks to evaluate existing capabilities. Submitters may be contacted to participate in an evaluation of their system hosted at ECBC in Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Maryland. Vendors both domestic and international are encouraged to respond. Submitters are advised to include all necessary participation expenses. These will be factored into the selection criteria. Selection for inclusion into the evaluation does not guarantee all expenses can be met.</p>
<p>PART I - Technical Criteria</p>
<p>The system should be able to support the sample processing of unknown clinical or environmental samples through to genomic sequencing and provide sequencing read data that can be used to identify viral and/or bacterial components. This request for information is focused solely on the sample-to-sequence capability and not the subsequent data analysis or assembly software. This evaluation does not require the use of select agents as equipment will be operating under BSL1/2 conditions. Specific information of interest is as follows:</p>
<p>&bull;Candidate systems must support complex sample processing from initial sample addition to shotgun sequencing read output including: nucleic acid extraction if necessary, nucleic acid sequencing preparation, and sequence read generation, all with minimal manual manipulation. Vendors must include an outline of the process from start to finish, the time involved in all processing steps including manual steps, and all components used.</p>
<p>&bull;Description must include existing system footprint, hardware specifications, power requirements, and a detailed description of the manual steps. Smaller specifications for size, weight, and power (SWAP) will be favored. Incorporate a concept for how SWAP could be reduced in future system models including a system footprint reduction to one cubic meter; include an outline/schedule and timeline for a realistic approach for such and all associated costs.</p>
<p>&bull;Include list of logistics, reagents, materials and associated costs. Favor will be given toward systems that have a lower logistical burden (i.e., battery, chemicals, refrigerated consumables, etc) and lower overall cost.</p>
<p>&bull;System may be separated into components that collectively support sample processing, sequence-ready nucleic acid preparation, and sequence read generation.</p>
<p>&bull;A description of how whole genome shotgun sequencing reads could be generated in approximately one hour of complex sample insertion should be included as well as the time involved for the existing system.<br /><br />&bull;System may contain software and firmware to coordinate sample processing and sequencer activities.</p>
<p>&bull;Sensitivity of system should be optimized to identify organisms in sample at low concentrations, i.e., 10 organisms in one sample.</p>
<p>&bull;Sample processing should support sample inputs of unknown aqueous clinical and aqueous environmental samples potentially containing bacterial cells and/or viral particles.</p>
<p>PART II - Submission of Information</p>
<p>Vendors desiring to respond to this request should provide a white paper as follows:</p>
<p>White Paper:</p>
<p>Limit the number of pages to four (4) total (Times New Roman, Font 12, one inch margins) excluding cover and photos which can be included separately. Interested vendors are also asked to submit a quad chart as a summary template. Describe technology including, at a minimum, the specific information of interest stated in Part I. Other information of potential interest that vendors could include are current and investigational applications of product, future commercial developments, references that document utility of the system or product, and photographs of complete system and components.</p>
<p>To be responsive to this announcement a vendor must supply their information as requested by 31 December 2012 as a Microsoft Word document. The recipient email address is: stacey.m.broomall.civ@mail.mil. At least one image of the full system should be submitted as a jpeg file with email file sizes not to exceed 3 megabytes. Vendors are requested to provide the name of Contact Person, telephone number, FAX number, email and complete address with each submission of data.</p>

<DESC>NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION Request for Information - Centennial Challenges Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Airspace Operations Challenge, NNH13ZUA001L AGENCY:   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION:   Request for Information by November 15, 2012.  Responses must be submitted in electronic form no later than November 15, 2012 to Dr. Larry Cooper, Centennial Challenges Program, NASA Headquarters, 300 E Street, SW, Washington, DC 205460001. E-mail address: larry.p.cooper@nasa.gov. For general information on the NASA Centennial Challenges Program see: http://www.nasa.gov/challenges	  . SUMMARY:   This notice is issued in accordance with 51 U.S.C. 20144. NASAs Centennial Challenge Program seeks to stimulate innovation in technologies that have value to NASA and the nation through open prize competitions that directly engage the public, academia, and industry. NASA is considering initiation of an Unmanned Aircraft Systems Airspace Operations Challenge (UAS AOC or Challenge) focused on finding innovative solutions to the problems surrounding the integration of UAS into the National Airspace System (NAS). The approach being considered would require competitors to maintain safe separation from other air traffic while operating their UAS in congested airspace, under a variety of scenarios. This will be accomplished through the use of sense and avoid technologies, as envisioned in the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). NASA is planning this Challenge in collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), with NASA providing the prize purse.  For general information on the NASA Centennial Challenges Program please see: http://www.nasa.gov/challenges    . The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is threefold: (1) determine the UAS communitys level of interest in competing in this Challenge, (2) gather feedback on the draft rules that are being released in association with this RFI, and (3) identify potential partners interested in (a) providing a venue for the flight competition, (b) assisting NASA in managing and executing this Challenge which may include qualification of potential competitors.  A set of draft rules, included in this RFI, has been developed for this Challenge, to give potential competitors and partners more insight into the scope and technical sophistication of the contest.  This RFI is for informational purposes only and the Government will not pay for the information received.  This RFI is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into any agreement or other obligation or to conduct a UAS Airspace Operations Challenge.  This document is for information and planning purposes and to gauge interest from the community in participation.  The Government welcomes all segments of industry, academia, and government, including associations, innovators, and enthusiasts to reply. Responses should be submitted in Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word format and are limited to five (5) pages in length.  Responses should include (as applicable):  name, address, email address, and phone number of the respondent, business, or organization, with point of contact for business or organization.   All responses are to be for general access by Government evaluators and comments on draft rules may be provided to the public.  Responses must be submitted in electronic form no later than November 15, 2012 to Dr. Larry Cooper, Centennial Challenges Program, NASA Headquarters 300 E Street SW, Washington, DC 205460001. E-mail address: larry.p.cooper@nasa.gov. DATES:	Due date for responses to this RFI is November 15, 2012 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Summary The UAS AOC being considered would initially be competed in 2013 at a location in the United States that will be determined prior to NASA announcement of the Challenge.  The successful integration of UAS into the NAS may be enabled by a series of technological and operational innovations that can be broadly applied to increase the safety and efficiency of the entire airspace system. The UAS AOC will be formulated to accelerate the development and integration of these innovations into single aircraft that can demonstrate these capabilities under realistic conditions, in flight. As currently envisioned, the UAS AOC would be divided into Level 1 and Level 2 competitions. Both would focus on capabilities that have been identified during the development of the Next Generation (NextGen) Airspace concept. The Level 1 Competition (L1C) would focus on a competitors ability to fly 4-Dimensional Trajectories (4DT) to provide a reasonable expectation that they will be where they are supposed to be, when they are scheduled to be there, successfully employ Automatic Dependent Surveillance  Broadcast (ADS-B), maintain safe separation from other ADS-B equipped air traffic, and operate safely in a number of contingency situations. The Level 2 Competition (L2C) would extend the requirements in each of these areas while adding a requirement to maintain safe separation from air traffic not equipped with ADS-B and a requirement that the vehicle be able to communicate verbally with the Air Traffic Control system under lost link conditions. Competitors would be required to have a working Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation (HiLSim) for their flight vehicle. The HiLSim would be used at the beginning of the competition, prior to flight, to verify that a competing UASs flight operators, ground software, and flight software exhibit the proper responses in a variety of safety-critical situations. It would also be used to verify that a team is capable of performing the basic tasks required by the competition. HiLSim test suites would be provided prior to the competition to allow competitors to verify they are in compliance with contest requirements during development. In order to meet flight test range safety requirements, the L1C may be preceded by a Qualification Round in which prospective teams would establish the airworthiness of their flight vehicle in addition to the flight skills of their system operators and/or safety pilot. Specific details of this process will depend on final competition site selection. I. Prize Amounts The purse for the L1C is planned to be $500,000 (five hundred thousand U.S. dollars). Up to 20% of the Level 1 prize purse may be used to reward competitors for successful completion of the Qualification Round. The L2C, which would be conducted approximately one year after successful completion of the L1C, is planned to have a prize purse of $1,000,000 (one million U.S. dollars).	Prizes will be offered to entries that meet specific requirements detailed in the final rules should a challenge be announced. II. Eligibility To be eligible to win a prize, the competitor must (1) register and comply with all requirements in the rules and enter into a team agreement; (2) in the case of a private entity, shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States, and in the case of an individual, whether participating singly or in a group, shall be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States; and (3) shall not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  The draft rules for the proposed UAS Challenge are included in the attachment.	Comments must be submitted no later than November 15, 2012 to Dr. Larry Cooper at E-mail address: larry.p.cooper@nasa.gov.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement. This notice is for market research purposes only and IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.
 
The Naval Air Systems Command, Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA is conducting a market survey to determine the interest and capability of Industry to participate in a competitive acquisition for Contractor Engineering Technical Services (CETS) Contractor Field Services (CFS) for Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC) , San Diego, CA.  Services will include on and off-site proficiency training, technical guidance and advice to resolve unusually complex technical problems.
  U.S. Government (USG) has authorized the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) transfer of twelve (12) P-3C aircraft and two (2) TP-3A aircraft to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO).  The Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) for FMS Case TW-P-SEG dated 22 December 2007 between the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the TECRO specifies the terms and conditions of the FMS sale.  The Taiwan Navy (TN) P-3C Program (TN P-3C) will acquire and modify twelve (12) P-3C Update IIIR aircraft with a Structural Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), tailored Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), and new missions system avionics.  The Twelve (12) P-3C aircraft will be activated from desert storage at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) in Tucson, Arizona and prepared for land transport to Lockheed Martins Greenville, South Carolina facility for the PDM, installation of the SSLE, and mission systems upgrade components.
  The first TN P-3C is scheduled for delivery to Taiwan in July of 2013.  Accurate and timely maintenance on the 12 TN P-3C aircraft is essential for the performance of these aircraft in order for the TN to complete their in-country training and meet their Initial Operational Capability (IOC) milestone.  It is essential that these aircraft be flight-ready and able to perform their military missions with the minimum possible failures or faults. CETS will assist the newly trained TN personnel to perform the necessary tasks, particularly those on new or modified systems. The Government is performing market research in order to determine if small businesses possess the capability to execute the requirements within this acquisition.
 Respondents need to indicate all small business designations. Interested business firms who meet the capability requirements identified in this notice are requested to reply to this notice with a response. Based upon small business responses received, consideration will be given to defining what part of the acquisition, if any, will be set-aside for small business competition.

<DESC>This is a SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small businesses, services-disabled veteran owned small businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and women-owned small businesses) having the capability to provide services to adjudicate pharmacy claims submitted under the Emergency Prescription Assistance Program (EPAP) for the Office of Preparedness and Emergency Operations (OPEO) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Secretary (OS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). Small Businesses with the ability to meet the staffing needs BARDA has based on BARDA's mission (both included in the description) are encouraged to submit capability statements in response to this Source Sought.
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The purpose of requirement is to obtain services of a qualified vendor to perform the activities related to adjudicating prescription drug claims for medications and Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and reimbursing pharmacies enrolled in the Emergency Prescription Assistance Program (EPAP) on the Government's behalf. This effort will allow any pharmacy in the United States and its territories to use existing electronic pharmacy systems as an infrastructure to efficiently process prescriptions and DME for individuals that are eligible for the EPAP. This effort is performed under the authority cited in Sections 403 and 502(a) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), 42 USC 5170b and 5192(a). Under that authority, ASPR may issue a task order to the contractor to perform tasks under the contract at any time.</p>
<p>As part of this requirement, the government shall require that any interested offeror make available a minimum limit of $1M for reimbursements to pharmacies. This means that once claims have been adjudicated, a vendor will then submit a list of approved claims to the government, allow for the government to verify that the approved claimant may be paid, and then reimburse the list of approved pharmacy claims up to $1M. Offerors will be permitted to invoice bimonthly for the reimbursements, even if at a level below $1M, but must guarantee that they can meet the reimbursement obligation up to $1M prior to the government reimbursing them.</p>
<p>Instructions for Capability Statements:</p>
<p>In order to be able to validate a firms capabilities, responses to this sources sought should demonstrate a vendor's experience in the adjudication of pharmaceutical claims, any access to nationwide pharmaceutical networks, and any other information regarding adjudication that the vendor may have experience with. In addition, interested vendors must acknowledge and make a statement that they can commit to the $1M minimum threshold, or if they cannot meet such a threshold, what their maximum threshold would be, and state how they would plan to maintain a reserve for those finances.</p>
<p>Please do not exceed 10 pages for your capability statement. Please include your business classification and DUNS number as part of your submission.</p>
<p><br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS NOT AN RFP; an RFP is anticipated on or about the week of April 16th, 2012. This Sources Sought notice does not bind the government to release an RFP. A set-aside determination will be made based in part on the capabilities a firm is able to demonstrate in response to this Sources Sought.</p>
<p>Responses to this Sources Sought announcement, along with a firm's capability statement referencing "Adjudicating EPAP Claims and Reimbursing Eligible Pharmacies - Capabilities" may be submitted to Brendan Miller, Contract Specialist.</p>

<DESC>The Department of the Army, Healthcare Acquisition Activity- North intends to negotiate five Sole Source commercial item procurements for Multiple Amputation Trauma Trainers for MacDill AFB, Travis AFB, Edwards AFB Tyndall AFB and Hurlburt AFB. This procurement will include liquid blood, Needle D Skin Plugs, Cric Skin, Manubrium Skin Plugs and training. This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than October 124th, 2012 noon local time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Michele Devine, Contract Specialist, e-mail: michele.g.devine.ctr@us.army.mil The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6). K Force Government Solutions Inc., is the only vendor in the commercial market that offers this product. It was researched and developed under the Severe Trauma Simulation Army Technology Objective (ATO), TraumaFX was engineered specifically to meet the rigorous requirements of military and civilian training needs. Jointly developed with the U.S. Army RDECOM-ARL-STTC, TraumaFX MATT leverages in-depth human factors requirements analyses of military and civilian training needs to deliver powerfully realistic, yet easy to use training solutions that can be deployed to any location and operated in nearly any weather condition. There is no other simulator on the market that provides this realistic, rugged, remote-control, tetherless training scenario complete with animatronics and special effects. Unlike other trainers, it can be worn by human actors and is compatible with other anthropomorphic trainers. The MATT has packable wounds, multiple tourniquet points, interchangeable priapism and scrotal avulsion and an upper torso that allows a multitude of procedures. The animatronics give a degree of control to the instructor to advance a training scenario. Students will learn how to find lifelike anatomical landmarks to execute critical patient treatment without relying on marked indicators. The sole source will avoid duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or the unacceptable delays due to the government. The purchase of any other unit would reduce the training that the MATT is able to provide.

<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY NOTICE FOR IDENTIFICATION OF NEW METHODS OF DEMILITARIZATION (DEMIL) 

The Office of the Product Manager Demilitarization and the Joint Munitions Command will co-sponsor and host an Industry Day for the identification of innovative ideas regarding the increased efficiency of ammunition demilitarization (DEMIL), primarily at Army depot installations. 
As Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA), the Army is responsible for the demilitarization of all fielded ammunition for the Military Services that is unserviceable, obsolete, or excessive to requirements.  The DEMIL stockpile exceeds 600,000 tons and is projected to grow; stockpile reduction is a significant challenge.  Demilitarization is the destruction and disposal of Defense items so that they cannot be used for further military purposes and their residual parts can be safely handled and disposed of by civilian society. Ammunition Demilitarization is conducted at Army Depots and certain commercial facilities through a variety of processes including, but not limited to closed disposal technologies, Open Burn / Open Detonation, thermal destruction, explosive fill extraction, and disassembly.


The purpose of this Industry Day is to enable the commercial industry and the Army ammunition community to identify and discuss new and innovative ways of conducting ammunition demilitarization on Army Depot installations in an open forum.  It will also explore the idea of public private partnerships at ammunition depots accomplishing demilitarization as a mechanism to encourage investment and increase efficiency in depot ammunition demilitarization operations.  This meeting is designed to provide depot capabilities and locations of ammunition stocks slated for demilitarization to commercial industry and solicit industry ideas on options for cooperative demilitarization operations between commercial industry and government depots.  The government will kick off this Industry Day with a detailed briefing highlighting the current Army Demilitarization Program to share information to spur discussion.  These slides are anticipated to be shared on this site on or around November 14, 2012.  Attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions during Industry Day, and those questions will be answered as time permits.  Any unanswered questions will be posted as an attachment to this notice on or about one (1) week following the event.  All information discussed at Industry Day will be unclassified.  All media and recording devices, including cellular smart phones, will not be allowed.

Industry is cordially invited to attend the Industry Day to be held: Date: 28 November 2012 Time: 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Location:  Cannon Gates Business Center, 121 Buffington Road, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000

It is requested that all participants review the DRAFT solicitation and submit proposed means and methods as well as any specific questions, comments, or concerns in writing via e-mail by close of business on October 26, 2012, to Beau.Corbett@us.army.mil. This will allow the technical team time to review industry submissions prior to the teleconference. Any information that is considered proprietary should be marked accordingly to alert Government personnel as to what can and cannot be released or discussed publicly without the prospective offeror's permission. The teleconference will begin with Jacksonville District personnel responding to industry questions, comments and concerns. An open discussion period will follow and any additional issues may be presented at that time.</p>
<p>The toll free dial in number for this teleconference is: (888) 830-6260 and the participant access code is 768759. The total number of available incoming phone lines is limited; therefore, it is requested that each firm utilize a minimum number of lines (preferably only one or two) for those individuals participating.

<p>The Jacksonville Harbor (Mile Point) Navigation Study Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Environmental Assessment will be posted to the link below for informational purposes.<br />http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/Navigation/NavigationProjects/JacksonvilleHaborMilePoint.aspx</p>
<p>Items for Discussion at Pre-Solicitation Teleconference<br />&bull; Construction Sequencing (prescribed order of work items and ideas about how the work will proceed)<br />&bull; Deconstruction of existing training wall and the processing of material for reuse<br />&bull; Work during strong tides/dynamic environment <br />&bull; Staging/Stockpiling/Processing requirements - sufficient space on Helen Cooper Park?<br />&bull; Temporary Containment features (prescribed-geotextile tubes vs. performance-met environmental and containment requirements)<br />&bull; Return water system (low spots on southern containment and/or through west wall?)<br />&bull; Structure foundation through scour holes (bags, tubes, riprap, sand?)<br />&bull; Concrete Structural Units (CSU) ideas (should we provide a default stone structure in addition?)<br />o Proposed training wall systems will need to promote tidal exchanges hydrating and draining the new salt marsh, and should also promote favorable oyster and fish habitat deliveries for a 3.9 Foot mean tide range using openings or windows. The systems will be required to resist loads for final dredge material placed at elevation +4 Feet MLLW with a base elevation at -2.5 Feet MLLW, while resisting overturning and sliding for described conditions. Approximate dredge slurry maximum elevation may achieve +4 Feet MLLW. Maximum river current velocity is 5 Feet/Second. Systems must deliver shoreline protection for wind and wave conditions with a design wave height of 5 Feet. Top of structure is required at elevation of not less than +7.5 Feet MLLW. The proposed system should be expected to perform with minimum operational maintenance and repair, and should remain structurally stable for a service period of 75 to 100 years.<br />&bull; Containment features behind the west training leg. (marine mattresses laying on the backs of the CSU's or geotextile tubes behind the CSU's, etc...) Would CSU manufacturers be comfortable having those earth pressures on their structures if we use marine mattresses, or the CSU may not have a flat face conducive for laying a marine mattress against?</p>

<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

Long-Term Contractor Personnel:<br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for<br />each new long-termii contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after<br />October 27, 2005:<br />a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge<br />issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment<br />Eligibility Verification, " and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal governmentissued<br />picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible<br />for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime<br />during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ<br />official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated<br />with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk<br />level:<br />High Risk- Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />Moderate Risk- Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation<br />(MBI)<br />Low Risk- National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:<br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;<br />2) Favorable fingerprint results;<br />3) Favorable credit report, ifrequired;iii<br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management<br />schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and<br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC)iv portion of the appli9able BI that<br />is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.<br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.<br />If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued<br />based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of<br />Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results).<br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If<br />the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.<br />2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel:<br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or<br />DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in<br />items 1a. and 1 b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:<br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;<br />b. Favorable fingerprint results;<br />c. Favorable credit report, if required; v and<br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of<br />the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.<br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire<br />six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a<br />twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the<br />full PIV-I identity proofing process.<br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this<br />contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second<br />request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of<br />extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or<br />four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to<br />the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.<br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.<br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to<br />DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless<br />of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that<br />delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.<br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please<br />reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy<br />memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.<br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access<br />for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver<br />requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.<br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a<br />daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must<br />be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.<br />If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need<br />to be re-approved each year.<br />4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the<br />individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and<br />DOJ's BI requirements.<br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.<br />Notes:<br />1 FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505 .pdf<br />1 Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ<br />facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-1 identity proofmg process, including initiation and<br />adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of<br />whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase ofHSPD-12 implementation (PIV-11) requires<br />badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.<br />1 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as<br />part of the pre-appointment waiver package.<br />In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating<br />investigations to OPM. Per OPM' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code 11 311 must be placed in<br />block 11 B 11 of the 11 Agency Use Only 11 section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case<br />types.<br />1 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as<br />part of the pre-appointment waiver package.<br />52.27-103-72 DOJ Contractor Residency Requirement (JUN 2004): For three of the five years<br />immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under the contract or<br />commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing services must have:<br />1.

<DESC>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Aviation intends to award a five (5) year Indefinite-Quantity Contract for the procurement of items that are sole source to B/E Aerospace, Inc. Items included in the solicitation population are sole source to B/E Aerospace, Inc. (Cage 2N935) and all B/E Aerospace divisions. This acquisition will include consumable items managed by DLA and depot level reparable (DLR) items managed by the Military Services.
<p>The resulting contract will be a Fixed-Price with prospective price redetermination pursuant to FAR 16.205 for multiple NSNs (National Stock Numbers) covering multiple Federal Stock Class Codes (FSCs), for spare parts utilized in various weapons systems, which include aircraft, electronics, engines, helicopters, ground equipment, sea vessels, and related hardware under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>Alternate offerors must submit a complete technical data package for each NSN for approval in order to be considered. Any items found to be competitive after award of the contract or become competitive after award, will be removed from the contract.</p>
<p>Shipments are to DLA depots within the Continental United States (CONUS). Consumable items are FOB destination with inspection/acceptance at origin or destination, dependent on item's criticality, and DLR items are FOB origin with inspection/acceptance at origin. The NSNs, part numbers, and annual estimated quantities for the initial population are available upon request. Any supplies to be furnished under this resulting contract will be ordered by issuance of a delivery order.</p>
<p>Surplus dealers and small business dealers and distributors having existing stocks of surplus or newly manufactured material are invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, Defense Logistics Agency Directive (DLAD) 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material, or adequate traceability documentation to show product is acceptable. In addition, respondents should identify quantity available and price. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly manufactured inventory is in the best interests of the government.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>Notice Type: <br />Combined Synopsis/Solicitation</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br />The Kentucky National Guards intent is to award a firm fixed price contract for the waste disposal services. This acquisition is a 100% small business set-a-side using NAICS code 562111, solid waste collection. The base period of performance will be from 1 December 2012 thru 30 November 2012 with 2 option years. The evaluation criteria will be the lowest price technically acceptable. Technical acceptability will be determined on the contractor's ability to meet the delivery schedule and the contractors past performance. <br />The Kentucky Army National Guard wants to establish prices for the following items; <br />1) 20 yard dumpster usage and disposal (60 each estimated emptying of dumpsters over one year period; emptying/service on an on call basis)<br />2) 8/10 yard dumpster usage and disposal (52 each estimated emptying of dumpsters over one year period; empty/service on an on call basis)<br />3) Fuel Surcharge associated with servicing and/or moving dumpsters<br />These prices will be used for the extent of the one year contract plus two option years. These dumpster usage and disposal services will be used for the full one year period and the dumpsters may be required to be moved on occasion to various locations and may be required to be serviced at different days on an "on-call" basis. The requirement for dumpsters will consistently fluctuate based on operations/support needs. 2 each 20 yard dumpsters and 2 each 8/10 yard dumpsters will be required to remain permanently on site at the servicing location.

<p>DIRECT SUPERVISOR:	Office Director, Program Office</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROL:	Minimal. Incumbent is expected to act independently with little direction.</p>

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE: 	Secret Level Clearance         <br /> <br /> <br />STATEMENT OF WORK FOR SUPERVISORY DEVELOPMENT OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER</p>
<p>A.  OVERVIEW:</p>
<p>USAID/Bangladesh manages a $200 million portfolio of development programming that spans Democracy and Governance, Food Security, Health and Climate Change.  Bangladesh is a focal country for four Presidential Initiatives: Feed the Future, Global Health, Global Climate Change and Global Engagement with the Muslim World. The mission's recently developed CDCS, for 2011-2016, guides mission activities toward the overall development goal of making Bangladesh a &lsquo;knowledge-based, healthy, food-secure and climate resilient middle income democracy.' As a focal country for the Presidential Initiatives and with a highly engaged Embassy, outreach and communications is a high priority for the Mission and the Embassy.</p>
<p>The mission has also recently developed a communication strategy, based on the CDCS, incorporating key messaging from each of the Presidential Initiatives and the agency's USAID Forward reform effort. The goal of the communication strategy is to promote a better understanding and awareness of the impact of USAID's cooperation with Bangladesh and to demonstrate the benefits of USAID programs. The communication strategy targets key audiences such as senior Bangladesh government officials, other donors, youth, private sector and civil society, local and international media and US lawmakers. The rationale for these selections is to reach decision-makers and opinion leaders on development issues to encourage good will and foster productive partnerships to achieve development goals.</p>
<p><br />B.  BASIC FUNCTION OF POSITION:</p>
<p>The Supervisory Development Outreach Communications (DOC) Officer is an essential member of the Program Office (PRO), which includes as a primary responsibility the production and dissemination of public information regarding the Mission and its development portfolio. The Supervisory DOC will lead the DOC team within PRO to investigate, analyze, collect, manage, and distribute information associated with the USAID foreign assistance program in Bangladesh. A crucial objective is to develop strategic information used to educate and promote better understanding of USAID programs for both Bangladeshi and American audiences. Equally important, is to ensure outreach activities further Mission and U.S. Embassy strategic goals. To effectively achieve these objectives, the Supervisory DOC Officer will work closely with the Embassy Public Affairs Section (PAS), Senior USAID staff, local news agencies, as well as USAID partners. The Supervisory DOC Officer will be USAID/Bangladesh's primary point of contact and liaison for all information requests on program activities. S/he will supervise the Supervisory DOC Specialist, who leads a highly motivated team of Bangladeshi professionals.</p>
<p>The Supervisory DOC Officer's knowledge, leadership, and expertise, have a major influence on the Senior Management Team's development outreach policies. The DOC team collaborates closely with technical offices and implementing partners, providing oversight, advice and guidance in developing and implementing the Mission's DOC strategy. Close collaboration with the Embassy's PAS will ensure that senior embassy personnel are properly apprised of USAID public outreach activities and projects, that policies and procedures regarding outreach communications are strictly adhered to and that USG interests are protected. Close collaboration with the Mission's Senior Management Team will ensure that outreach activities support USAID / Bangladesh strategic goals including, but not limited to, those outlined in the Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS). A key function of this position will be to mentor the DOC team and build capacity within the mission and with implementing partners to develop more effective communication plans and materials. S/he will also serve as principal liaison with the Agency's Legislative and Public Affairs Bureau in Washington (USAID/LPA).</p>
<p>Under the direction of the Mission Director, PRO is responsible for overseeing the formulation and implementation of the Mission's CDCS for Bangladesh and assisting to define the role and objectives of U.S. assistance. This includes ensuring that the Agency's program policies are adhered to and reflected in the Mission's programming policies and procedures.

<p>RESPONSE DATE: 15 NOVEMBER 2012</p>
<p>CONTRACT SPECIALIST NAME &amp; PHONE NUMBER: TEDRA N. THOMPSON, 904 232-2016</p>
<p><br />THIS NOTICE IS POSTED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY: THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING CONTRACTORS AWARDED A CONTRACT UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER</p>
<p>W912EP-10-R-0023 &amp; W912EP-12-R-0011: Great Lakes Dredge and Dock, LLC (W912EP-11-D-0004); Weeks Marine, Inc. (W912EP-11-D-0005); Manson Construction Company (W912EP-11-D-0006); Dutra Dredging Company (W912EP-11-D-0007) and Cashman Dredging and Marine Contracting (W912EP-12-D-0003)</p>
<p><br />PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FROM ANY ENTITY OTHER THAN THE PREVIOUSLY LISTED FIRMS INCLUDED IN THE GROUP1 MATOC POOL.</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The proposed project is to construct beach nourishment along 4 miles of the Atlantic Ocean shoreline commencing south from the northern boundary of Martin County between the FDEP reference monuments R-1 through R-25. The approved historical beach fill template included a 9O-foot wide berm at Elevation +6.5 NAVD 88. The constructed foreshore slope would be 1:10. At the south of the project, the beach tapers to the existing profile at monument R-25. The beach fill design also includes a 65-foot wide dune feature that has a 20-foot wide crest at Elevation +11.0 NAVD 88.</p>
<p>For this project, the Contractor shall construct alternate equal-length segments of shoreline using the historical template mentioned above with an experimental construction template. The experimental or turtle-friendly template would begin at the design toe of the dune at Elevation +6.5 NAVD 88. The design beach profile would slope at 1 on 50 to Elevation +5.5 NAVD 88 (50-foot wide). From this point, the turtle-friendly profile shall slope at 1 on 20 to mean low water (Elevation +2.6 NAVD 88). This experimental segment of fill shall also include the dune feature as specified above. The distance from R-1 to R-25 is approximately 21,600 feet. Each 2000-foot segment shall be separated by a 700-foot transition. The north limit of the project shall transition into the existing beach profile at R-1 with a 200-foot taper.</p>
<p>Magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.<br />To fill this project will require a hopper dredge or similar equipment to obtain beach quality sand that will come from a borrow site located approximately 6 nautical miles offshore of the northern portion of the project. Designated pipeline corridors shall be used by the Contractor for access to the beach. This will minimize impact on the marine habitat offshore. The request for proposal will be issued on 10 OCTOBER 2012 and proposals will be due on or about 09 NOVEMBER 2012. The award of the task order will be made on the basis of Lowest Price Technical Acceptable (LPTA). For LPTA, the technical evaluation factors are availability of technically acceptable plant and equipment and past performance. Districts can contact the Jacksonville District regarding contractors' performance under the MATOC and/or check contractors' past performance on PPIRS (CCASS). See attached request for proposal for submission requirements.</p>
<p>The request for proposal will be issued in electronic format only and will be posted on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/. In order to receive notification of any amendments, firms must REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. If you are not registered, the Government is not responsible with providing you with notification of any changes to this solicitation. NAICS Code 237990, size standard $20 million.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<DESC>Questions 10/16/2012:
<p>1. Item 8.b Engineering Services: Are you providing that service to<br />have the layout design that you want? Or Is that to be included as part of<br />the quote.</p>
<p>**** The design service is part of the quote. ****</p>
<p>2. Do you have one of each case now to make samples? If not would you<br />like to have them?</p>
<p>**** Sample of the case design would be nice as a first article and would be<br />easier than drawings for approval. ****</p>
<p>3. Will you supply the articles going in to the cases for best fit and<br />lay out testing and configuration.</p>
<p>**** We do have initial prototype cables but they would need to remain here.<br />****</p>
<p>4. Page 2 of PD A-10 AWTS Transit cases is blank. Is there any missing<br />information?</p>
<p>**** The PD should have 10 sections concluding with "10. Warranty". ****</p>
<p>5. The Acrylite FF-Red, 0118FF is not a good number according to the technical<br />section of the manufacturer of Acrylite. Please check with engineering to<br />determine the correct color number and the thickness of the material to be<br />used. Also, if we could determine the purpose of the Acrylite in the base<br />and lid of the cases, our engineers may be able to suggest an alternative<br />material to reduce cost and still maintain the necessary properties.</p>
<p>****The purpose of the Acrylite is to protect the foam and to provide a contrast for instantaneous inventory of the case. Red was specified by our customer. The updated PD describes the use of the material.****</p>

Delivery of non-conforming products results in delivery delays and increased costs to the Government. <br /><br />Please note that if you receive this award, your performance under this contract (including timeliness of deliveries and the quality of supplies/services delivered) will be monitored and recorded by this contracting office. This information may be used to determine a record of past performance for future contract awards. Contractors/offerors that are concerned about their record of past performance may contact this office if they wish to view and discuss their records.<br /><br />EVALUATION OF AWARD <br /><br />(1) Price: The Government will evaluate quotes based on prices quoted in the paragraph (v) of this solicitation. <br /><br />(2) Past Performance: This factor will be based on information obtained from any sources available to the JMTC Contracting Office, including the PD2 Vendor Performance Database for the JMTC Contracting Office, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System- Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR) and other records maintained by the JMTC Contracting Office or other agencies. Data maintained by this contracting office may include an offeror's record of performance on previous contracts issued by this contracting office. Quotes received from vendors with no past performance history information will be evaluated based on information obtained from various sources, such as contracting agency experience with the contractor, previous contract history available from DCMA, etc. The Government does not intend to discuss any negative Past Performance data with offerors, if that data is contained in the JMTC contracting office's own records on past contract performance, or PPIRS-SR database. <br /><br />The Government intends to make a single award to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, based on an integrated analysis of each offeror's Past Performance and Price. The final award decision will be a trade-off between Past Performance and price, with the Past Performance factor being more important than price.<br /><br />The Government will develop a Past Performance rating for each offeror, based on the Past Performance information described above. This may include numerically-generated scores (such as PPIRS-SR), narrative information contained in this contracting office's own databases, or descriptions provided by references. The contracting officer will analyze this information and develop an adjectival rating, going from "Low Risk" to "Medium Risk" and finally "High Risk". Offerors who have no past performance information will be assigned a "Neutral Risk" rating.<br /><br />The contracting officer will perform a trade-off analysis based on the assigned Past Performance rating and price for each proposal. In determining the best value to the Government, award may be made to other than the lowest-priced proposal. While the Past Performance factor is more important than price, the price factor may become controlling as Past Performance ratings tend to equalize. <br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS FOR QUOTE SUBMISSION<br /><br />The Government intends to make an award based on a best value basis. This process will involve a trade-off analysis, if applicable, between Price and Performance Risk. This may result in award to other than the low quote and/or other than the highest rated (best performance risk) quote. <br /><br />For the evaluation of Performance Risk, the Government will obtain information from the any sources available to the JMTC Contracting Office, including the PD2 Vendor Performance Database for the JMTC Contracting Office, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System- Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR) and other records maintained by the JMTC Contracting Office or other agencies. You are not required to submit any additional information on Performance Risk. The Government does not intend to discuss performance risk information with the offerors.<br /><br />FAR 30.202-1(a) DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FORM<br /><br />Disclosure Statement, Form CASB-DS-1, is not included in this solicitation<br />package. Any offeror meeting the criteria for concurrent submission of the<br />Disclosure Statement, who has not previously received the form from another Government source, will immediately contact the cognizant ACO (See DOD Directory of Contract Administration Components (DOD 4105.59H)) to obtain a copy of the form.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is, in fact, unable to maintain a mailing list. The burden is therefore on any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal nonresponsive and result in the rejection of the proposal. <br /><br />NOTICE TO ALL CONTRACTORS: All contractors who provide goods/services to the Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the Central Contractors Register (CCR). You may register via the Internet at https://www.uscontractorregistration.com/. Further information may be obtained through the internet at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/faq.html.<br /><br />If you have any further questions, please call Brendon M. Courtade, (586) 282.9748 or e-mail at brendon.m.courtade.civ@mail.mil. <br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Additionally, the Government seeks to collect data from companies interested in this requirement. If your company is interested in this procurement, please provide a response to the contract specialist, Mr. Brendon Courtade at Brendon.m.courtade.civ@mail.mil no later than 20 Sep 2012. NOTE: These responses are voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to the sources survey and any follow-on information requests. Responses are NOT required to bid on any future solicitation. See below:<br /><br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or PROPRIETARY restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br /><br />1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br /><br />2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br /><br />3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data. <br /><br />4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS." <br /><br />5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br /><br />6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain confidential information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE:<br /><br />1. Number each response with the appropriate question number.<br /><br />2. You do not have to repeat the question in your response. <br /><br />3. If you cannot answer the question, please indicate "No Response."<br /><br />4. If a response will satisfy another question, state: "See response to question XX." <br /><br />5. Include relevant sales media and product manuals. If providing an ACROBAT formatted manual, annotate the manual to indicate which material is applicable to the questions. If preferred, include Internet Web links to locations where animations/videos may be viewed. <br /><br />6. If your sales media and/or manuals contain a restricted distribution statement, issue a release statement indicating that the restricted material may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this Sources Survey. <br /><br />7. Spell out any acronyms in their first instance. <br /><br />8. Clearly mark any confidential information. If applicable the front page of your response package should state "Confidential Information Contained." <br /><br />Provide a release statement indicating that the confidential information may distributed to Army personnel involved with this Market Survey. <br /><br />A. GENERAL <br /><br />1. Manufacturer <br />a. Name <br />b. Mailing Address <br />c. Cage Code (if any) <br />d. Website <br /><br />2. Personnel Responding to Questionnaire <br />a. Name <br />b.

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE: <br />The Joint Project Manager for Protection (JPM P) Pre-Solicitation Conference for the Contamination Indication/Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS).
<p>The Joint Project Manager for Protection (JPM P) and the Contamination Indication/Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS) Program will host a Pre-Solicitation Conference to inform and solicit input from industry regarding the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the CIDAS. This Pre-Solicitation Conference will be conducted from 0900 - 1400 on 8 November 2012 in the Aberdeen Proving Ground - Edgewood, Maryland area. The exact location and facility access instructions (if any) will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>Following the Pre-Solicitation Conference, an opportunity will be afforded to attendees for 15 minute one-on-one discussions with the CIDAS Product Manager. The discussions will be held on 8 November from 1400-1700 at the same general location as the Pre-Solicitation Conference. Interested companies may register for one-on-one discussions at the Pre-Solicitation Conference. Due to the limited amount of time available, one-on-one discussion time slots will be given to interested companies in the order in which they are received until no more slots are available, no exceptions.</p>
<p>Interested companies must pre-register no later than 1530 hours EDT 1 November 2012 as follows:<br />Request for attendance must be sent via e-mail to Mrs. Kelly Conerly at kelly.y.conerly@navy.mil and Ms. Amanda Yocum at amanda.l.yocum@us.army.mil. Due to conference facility size, attendance is limited. Your request must include the company name, contact person, address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address and the names of the representatives planning to attend. Attendance is not mandatory and will not affect your eligibility to submit an RFP offer.</p>
<p>For security purposes, all interested companies must submit, ON COMPANY LETTERHEAD, the following information: <br />Company Name, Address <br />Subject: Contamination Indication Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS) Pre-Solicitation Conference Participation, 8 November 2012<br />Contact Person, Address, Phone Number, Fax Number, Email Address <br />Name(s) of attendee(s), Phone Number(s), Email Address(es)<br />The letter must be e-mailed to Ms. Conerly and Ms. Yocum at the e-mail addresses above no later than 1530 hours EDT 1 November 2012.</p>
<p>All attendees from outside the United States must submit the International Visitor Information Form and supporting documentation as a requirement to participate in the Pre-Solicitation Conference and one-on-one discussions. The International Visitor Information Form and supporting documentation must be e-mailed to Ms. Conerly and Ms. Yocum at the e-mail addresses above no later than 1530 hours EDT 1 November 2012.</p>
<p>Detailed information regarding the Pre-Solicitation Conference, including agenda, directions, conference facility and accommodations will be posted when the exact location is announced. It is incumbent upon interested parties to monitor this posting for updated information.</p>
<p>Draft RFP: <br />The draft RFP for the CIDAS program is posted in the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov for solicitation W911QY-13-R-0001.</p>
<p>Send questions and comments regarding the draft RFP to Ms. Jean Greenwood at jean.t.greenwood.civ@mail.mil with a courtesy copy to Mr. Peter Wallace at peter.j.wallace6.civ@mail.mil no later than 1530 hours EDT 1 November 2012. Questions received regarding the draft RFP will be discussed at a planned Q&amp;A session during the Pre-Solicitation Conference.</p>
<p>Contamination Indication/Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS):<br />The goal of CIDAS is to provide the Warfighter a capability that not only detects trace levels of chemical warfare agents on surfaces before and/or after a decontamination operation, but also visually indicates the exact location of that contamination and provides significant utility during Detailed Equipment Decontamination (DED) operations. This technology will afford Warfighters the ability to accurately map the area of disseminated contamination on equipment and quickly determine if a given area is (or is not) contaminated. This technology has unique benefits, such as isolating "hot spots" from "clean spots" on surfaces and visibly indicating whether standard decontamination procedures performed were successful. Given the capability to visibly indicate contaminant location on a surface, DED personnel will be able to focus decontamination efforts on the localized threat, therefore dramatically reducing manpower, water requirements, decontaminant requirements and exposure hazard to Warfighters performing DED while increasing decontamination efficiency. The CIDAS must be compatible with a wide range of materiel and facilities to avoid degrading readiness and capabilities due to damage from the application of indicant.</p>
<p>Refer to the Draft RFP for additional information and evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. No solicitation exists at this time. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties for participating in the pre-solicitation conference or responding to this notice.</p>
ANNOUNCEMENT OF DRAFT RFP:<br />The Army Contracting Command -Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, in support of the Joint Program Manager for Protection (JPM P) and the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Program, hereby issues a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in advance of a Pre-solicitation Conference/Industry Day for the Contamination Indication/Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS). Details for the Pre-solicitation Conference/Industry Day, if conducted, will be forthcoming. This is a draft RFP made available for comment prior to the Pre-solicitation Conference/Industry Day.

Given the capability to visibly indicate contaminant location on a surface, Detailed Equipment Decontamination (DED) personnel will be able to focus decontamination efforts on the localized threat, therefore dramatically reducing manpower, water requirements, decontaminant requirements and exposure hazard to Warfighters performing DED while increasing decontamination efficiency. The CIDAS must be compatible with a wide range of materiel and facilities to avoid degrading readiness and capabilities due to damage from the application of indicant. <br /><br />The draft RFP and associated attachments can be accessed from the solicitation link on this page. This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. No solicitation exists at this time.<br /><br />The announcement number W911QY-13-R-0001 will be the controlling document and the Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse companies or entities that respond in any way to this Draft RFP. <br /><br />Any information concerning a Pre-solicitation conference/Industry Day, if conducted, will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website at https://www.fbo.gov under announcement number W911QY-13-R-0001.<br /><br />Questions regarding this Draft RFP will only be accepted in writing via e-mail to jean.t.greenwood.civ@mail.mil with a courtesy to peter.j.wallace6.civ@mail.mil. <br />

<DESC>The "TSI NSN Listing" available at the TSI website has been modified to reflect the current TSI Program NSNs, associated&nbsp;request for proposal (RFP) numbers and annual demand quantity (ADQ) as of 8 Sep 2010.<br /><br />The "Requisition History" (by zip code)&nbsp;for all TSI NSNs was posted 2 Sep, however, review of the data indicates duplicate listings of certain requisitions have inflated said data. It is anticipated a corrected requisition history will be posted by COB 10 Sep 2010.<br /><br />The TSI Program solicitations are currently under Agency reviews. When a firm release date for the LTC RFPs and TSI Contractor solicitation are determined, a notice will be posted via FBO.

<p>There was proprietary information in the incorporated subcontracting plan that was erroneously released in the award announcement and DLA Land &amp; Maritime requests that&nbsp;anyone who has accessed this data to please shred or destroy the information.</p>

<DESC>DLA Land and Maritime intends to solicit a total of 29 tires as split award candidates under four of the eight TSI&nbsp;LTC Vendor solicitations. The tires, to be identified in the pending solicitations, will request pricing at 100%, 70%, 50% and 30% of the total requirement&nbsp;and be evaluated on a Lowest-Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) basis. <br /><br />If the Government is able to determine split award pricing (70/30 or 50/50) fair and reasonable, a split award will result. If the Government is unable to make a fair and reasonable price determination for either allocation of the split(s), the Government will execute a single award to the LPTA offeror, assuming that single, 100% award price is determined fair and reasonable.

This is a Presolicitation Notice. This Notice is being issued for planning and informational purposes only. This notice is not a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice, nor will the Government accept proposals as a result of this Notice. The plans and technical specifications for this requirement will only be available upon solicitation issuance. <br /><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The relocation of BCR will tie in to the recently completed roadway on the east in the vicinity of the west end of the Polaris Parking Lot and, on the west, will tie-in to the existing Bear Creek Road just before the intersection with Old Bear Creek Road.

The road will have 12-foot lanes (one in each direction) with a 10-foot-wide utility shoulder on the south side and an 18-foot-wide utility shoulder on the north.<br /><br />A precast concrete beam bridge will be erected so BCR will pass over the haul road to prevent traffic into the Y-12 Complex from being interrupted or delayed by trucks on the haul road. The overpass will provide minimum vertical clearance of 20 feet, and the lower road will have a minimum width clearance of 45 feet for the full length. <br /><br />The BCR relocation scope consists of:<br />Roadway construction, including overpass<br />Tie-in to BCR eastern section<br />Tie-in on the west just before the intersection of existing BCR and Old Bear Creek Road<br />Steel casing for future duct bank crossing<br />Drainage structures (including 3 retention ponds and storm drains)<br />Safety appurtenances (i.e., guardrails, etc.)<br />Signs and pavement marking<br />Spur under the overpass with a base course of asphalt and temporary lane markings and signs<br />Signalization, as determined by a study<br /><br />Construction of 4,000 feet of a City of Oak Ridge 24-in diameter waterline and ~3,600 feet of a plant 16-in diameter waterline, are part of the road construction. The new reinstalled potable water lines will parallel the relocated Bear Creek Road. The 24-in line will be installed in the 18-foot utility shoulder on the north side of the road, while the 16-in line, which will reduce to 12 inches, will be installed in the 10-foot shoulder on the south side. Installation will include new valve vaults in addition to use of existing valve vaults. Installation also includes electrical service for motor-operated valves and flow event date messaging; duct banks will be installed for lines and cables, and an existing control panel will be relocated and a new control panel installed. Although these waterlines and associated power will be installed in this WBS element, tie-ins to the City of Oak Ridge and Y-12 potable water systems, as well as electrical tie-ins will occur in a following phase of work.<br /><br />This description is not intended to be all encompassing and is subject to change. <br /><br />NAICS CODE AND SBA SIZE STANDARD: The NAICS code for this project is 237310 with a size standard of $33,500,000. <br /><br />PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS: Offerors will be invited to submit a proposal subject to Project Labor Agreement (PLA) requirements (a PLA proposal), a proposal not subject to PLA requirements, or both.

The Total Acquisition Value (TAV) of the contract awarded under this solicitation will not exceed $240M and will have a 10-year ordering period with a 5-year base period, one 3-year option period and another 2-year option period. The work will be performed primarily at the New Bedford Harbor site, although the contract will allow for work at other sites requiring these services within the mission areas of the North Atlantic Division. The awarded contract will include firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable task orders. This will be a performance-based procurement. Specific outcomes will be defined in each negotiated task order. Task orders will be awarded up to the maximum capacity of $240,000,000.00. There is no limit of the number of Task Order(s) that may be executed, but in no case shall the sum of all Task Order(s) executed exceed $240,000,000.00. The Government is obligated to satisfy a minimum guaranteed amount of not less than $200,000.00 over the base period of the contract.<br /><br />The primary work involves dredging, de-sanding dewatering, and disposal of sediments contaminated with PCBs. Other requirements include the operation of a water treatment facility, technical support including evaluations, cost analysis, studies, investigations, and other remedial actions as necessary. The remedial action at the New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site (NBHSS) is expected to take an additional 20+ years to complete based on the current annual funding levels. NBHSS operations are unique in both their complexity and scale. Highly contaminated sediment is pumped in a slurry through de-sanding, dewatering and treatment processes with the end product being clean water and dry filter cake that is then shipped to an offsite disposal facility. There are very few projects in the country that present the challenges faced by the contractor working in New Bedford. The work is currently being conducted through a Total Environmental Restoration Contract (TERC) under a Joint Venture agreement with Jacobs Engineering Group Inc and Tetra Tech EC, Inc. <br /><br />The work under the solicitation involves providing all labor, equipment, materials, program/project/ construction management and engineering required to perform remediation of PCB contaminated sediment from the Acushnet River in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Remediation includes dredging, removal of sand/oversized material from the dredge material, dewatering of the dredge sediment, PCB/metals treatment of the dredge water stream, loading, securing of contaminated waste streams in rail cars for disposal in a PCB regulated landfill, provide trucking option for disposal of same waste in the event rail service becomes unavailable. Remediation will also include the construction of three CDFs along the shoreline, maintenance, monitoring, and closure of Cell 1 (pilot CDF/Dredge Disposal Area), and monitoring of pilot cap area in the outer harbor. Remediation will also be performed on wetlands and mudflat areas of the Acushnet River estuary. Proposed PCB disposal also includes construction of Confined Aquatic Disposal (CAD) cells to receive up to 300,000 cubic yards of untreated dredge material. The contractor may also be responsible for construction and disposal of dredge material in CAD cells with split hull dredge scows using appropriate methods to promote consolidation. Once filled and consolidated, the contractor shall install an engineered CAD cell cap. Underwater capping of low PCB contaminated sections of the upper New Bedford Harbor estuary may also performed under the scope of this contract. <br /><br />As part of the remediation activities, a rigorous environmental monitoring program of air and water contamination is required. Results from the environmental program are used in contamination modeling applications.<br /><br />Please note this is not a request for proposals at this time, the solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about&nbsp;OCTOBER 31, 2012. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of the solicitation will be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov).

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the agency's need for these services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for this requirement. Time only permits that one source be solicited to provide technical support services for the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). By not awarding a modification to extend the period of performance on the bridge contract it would adversely impact the mission of the NDBC (In accordance with FAR 6.302(a)(2).
<p>This Modification is to extend the period of performance of contract QA133W-12-CN-0097 through December 31, 2012. The modification incorporates a Base Month (Oct 1-31, 2012) and 2 one-month options (Nov 1-30, 2012 and Dec 1-31, 2012). The acquisition is to provide uninterrupted contractor support services to meet the operational mission of NDBC. NDBC's mission is to operate a global ocean and coastal marine observation network for NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS). This network provides critical data on oceanic and atmospheric conditions that is used by weather and hurricane forecasters, researchers, climatologists, oceanographers, commercial fishers, and recreational boaters, among others, to prevent catastrophic losses of life and property. NDBC operates a network of near coastal and off-shore marine weather and oceanographic buoys, unmanned Coastal Marine Automated Network CCMAN) stations, NOAA's Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART) network, and the Tropical Atmosphere and Ocean (TAO) array network. NDBC currently operates and maintains 110 moored marine weather and oceanographic buoys, 4 near-coastal ocean observing buoys, 50 C-MAN stations, 39 DART monitoring stations, 55 TAO surface, and 4 TAO subsurface buoys.</p>

<DESC>To address challenges to Peru's decentralization process, this Project will assume an integrated, cross-sectoral approach to produce coherent, comprehensive and coordinated interventions. The Project will pursue the overall goal of: Improved decentralized management for effective service delivery benefitting marginalized populations in target regions (Madre de Dios, Amazonas, Loreto, San Martin, Ucayali). By working across different sectors (horizontal) and levels of government (vertical), the Project will achieve tangible improvements in sub-national government performance, in particular public service delivery to disadvantaged groups, such as women and indigenous communities. The contractor will focus on the following three areas to promote efficient and effective public service delivery by sub-national governments.
<p>1. National Policy: Improve key policies and implement reforms that directly impact decentralization and sub-national governance.</p>
<p>2. Institutional Strengthening: Strengthen sub-national institutions for effective public service delivery and improved management of social conflict and disaster risk reduction.</p>
<p>3. Transparency and Accountability: Enhance government accountability through improved formal transparency mechanisms and expanded participatory processes.</p>

<p>1. Contracting Activity: U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, <br />Installation Division, ATTN: CCAP-SCI, 4118 Susquehanna Ave, Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Maryland (MD) 21010-5401.</p>
<p>2. Description of Action: This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition seeks the approval to award sole source to CMS Field Products for preventive maintenance and repairs of the CMS/OI Analytical chemical agent air monitoring equipment in support of the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), Environmental Monitoring Laboratory for the US Secret Service location in Washington, DC (Bolling Air Force Base). This requirement will be awarded as a new Firm-Fixed Price Contract under FAR Part 12. The estimated value for the contract is $572,964 and will be obligated with FY12 2VCD11 Operations and Maintenance Army (OMA) funds.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services: The services being procured are for preventive maintenance, repair services, as well as technical and factory support services for 32 MINICAMS&reg; units, ChromLink&reg;Sysetms, Stream Selection Systems and 1 ChromNet&reg; system. All labor (performed during normal business hours, Monday thru Friday), repair parts, consumable supplies installed by CMS personnel, travel, per diem and report costs are included in the cost of the service agreement. Twelve (12) emergency site visits, one per month, are also included in the cost. If a piece of equipment cannot be repaired, replacement is not covered under the proposed agreement. The requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Service to be performed on a semi-annual basis will include but is not limited to: Functional testing of the MINICAMS electronics circuits and aligning pressure-transducer and electrometer circuits (if needed). Cleaning the GC module and inlet system by back flushing them with solvents, if needed. Checking GC module gas flows. Replacing the preconcentrator tube, cleaning the inlet valve, and testing the gas inlet system for leaks. Upgrading MINICAMS software (with permission and after testing to ensure no communication problems). Adjusting operating parameters and installing minor engineering upgrades are required. Functional testing of the overall system by calibrating and challenging the system with an appropriate compound. Verify error-free communications on the CHROM-NET air monitoring data network. Check hard drive for errors and free space of the CHROM-NET air monitoring data network central processing unit. <br />b. The on-site service technician will be formally trained by CMS Field Products in repair of covered instrumentation and will have at least 5 years of direct repair experience specifically on CMS Field Products equipment. The contractor will use all CMS approved parts. CMS Field Products reserves the right to refuse to perform service on any piece of equipment under unsafe conditions or if it is contaminated. The proposed Preventative Maintenance, Repair Service, and Technical Support Contract includes normal wear and tear which is fair and reasonable but does not include instrument abuse, misuse, mishandling or misapplication resulting from unfair and unreasonable use. Also instruments that are damaged during shipping are not covered unless CMS is specifically responsible for shipping.</p>
<p><br />c. The total estimated dollar cost for the contract sought is: The total estimated value for the contract is $572,964.00 broken down by year as:<br /><br />Base Year - $132,936.00<br />Option Year 1 - $139,584.00<br />Option Year 2 - $146,556.00<br />Option Year 3 - $153,888.00<br />4. Authority Cited: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as authorized in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br />5. Reason for Authority Cited: <br />a. O/I Analytical/ CMS Field Products is the sole source supplier of repair parts, training, and certification in the safe and competent operation of the MINICAMS line of air-monitoring equipment. There are no authorized distributors or re-sellers of MINICAMS repair or replacement parts in the United States. MINICAMS is proprietary technology, protected by two U. S. patents (5,014,541 and 5,052,805) and the name "MINICAMS" is a registered trademark (United States Patent and Trademark Office Registration No. 1,500,285). This monitoring system is available only from the CMS Field Products, Pelham, Alabama, a wholly owned subsidiary of O.I. Analytical, College Station, Texas.</p>
<p>b. Sensitive analytical equipment is used to detect chemical warfare material during demilitarization operations. This equipment is essential in providing protection to human health and the environment. These operations are conducted at various worksites within the U.S. and abroad. The requested vendor manufactured the equipment and has the expertise, parts inventory, trained technicians and offset the response time required to address preventative maintenance and emergency repairs in a timely manner. The inability to procure this contract will prevent our organization from supporting high visibility operations and delay scheduled deployments which will be costly and detrimental to our agency and the many government agencies we support.</p>
<p>c. The market standard for a service contract for unlimited repair of a piece of analytical equipment is 10% of purchase cost per year. The 32 MINICAMS&reg; units, ChromLink&reg; units, Stream Selection Systems and ChromNet&reg; system covered by this contract represent a capital investment of at least $2 million. Ten percent of the combined purchases is $200,000. The contractor selected must meet the contract requirements at a cost to the government of $200,000 or less per year.</p>
<p>6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: A notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis was published on 16 August 2012 to the Government's Federal Business Opportunities website. To date, 24 August 2012, there have been no responses to the notice of intent to award sole source to CMS Field Products, Inc. No comparable service meeting the Government's requirement has been identified in past published notices. Efforts were made to identify comparable vendor's services through literature searches, internet searches, requests for product information, and technical trade journals. Prior to exercising any option year under this contract and in accordance with FAR Part 17.202, the Government will conduct market research to determine if other vendors have acquired the ability to provide this service.</p>
<p>7. Actions to Increase Competition: The Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), Environmental Monitoring Laboratory (EML) has attempted to develop an alternative near real time monitoring system for chemical agents and toxic industrials compounds. The Environmental Monitoring Laboratory (EML) has not been able to develop another system that detects as many of these compounds as the O/I Analytical CMS Field Products and with the same detection limits. ECBC will continue research other interoperable systems.</p>
<p>8. Market Research: Market research was conducted within the last twelve months by the requiring activity at ECBC as well as the contracting agency. A search was conducted on the internet as well as discussions with the end users and other knowledgeable individuals within the government and industry. A sole source contract for identical work was awarded on 21 February 2012 for preventative maintenance on MINICAM equipment located in Edgewood. At the time when market research was conducted, no potential vendors were identified. Six months after this contract was awarded, still no prospective contractors have been identified by ECBC or the contracting agency. Market research was conducted by Amy Dubree and Michael Knudsen with the Environmental Monitoring Laboratory of ECBC prior to the award completed in February as well as before submitting the request for maintenance at Bolling AFB. A Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source was posted on FedBizOpps for any potential vendors who might be able to perform the work. No interested contractors contacted the Government. CMS Research Corporation / OI Analytical is the only manufacturer of the MINICAMS software and portable MINICAMS hardware compatible with Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) current air monitoring systems. The requirement is for the maintenance of current MINICAMS sampling systems and will augment on -hand capabilities, by ensuring sufficient instrumentation availability for current or future testing requirements. This equipment is necessary to provide a continuous safe work environment for ECBC air monitoring with minimal downtime and operating expense. Due to the continuous chemical testing operations at Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) sites and the stringent air monitoring requirements, a significant quantity of the MINICAM systems (over two hundred (200) MINICAMS), have been purchased in the past and are presently in operation.</p>
<p>9. Interested Sources: To date no other sources have expressed an interest in the requirement of maintenance and repairs of MINICAMS.</p>
<p>10. Other Facts:</p>
<p>a. Procurement history: <br />&bull; W91ZLK-06-C-0016, awarded September 28, 2006 in the amount of $3,446,028 with a base and four one-year options. <br />&bull; W91ZLK-10-P-1299, awarded September 29, 2010 in the amount of $105,780.00 with a base and one option year. <br />&bull; W91ZLK-12-C-0005, awarded February 21, 2012 in the amount of $572,708.00 with a base and one option year.</p>
<p>The Government has attempted to fulfill the statutory requirements to increase competition as well as small business concerns; however historical data shows that CMS Fields Products, Inc is the sole provider for these particular services. A Notice of Intent to award on a sole source basis was published through ASFI for all the previous orders and no responses were received.</p>
<p>b. Subcontracting Opportunities: The MINICAMS is proprietary technology, protected by two U. S. patents (5,014,541 and 5,052,805) and the name "MINICAMS" is a registered trademark (United States Patent and Trademark Office Registration No. 1,500,285). This monitoring system is available only from the CMS Field Products, Pelham, Alabama, a wholly owned subsidiary of O.I.</p>
<p>Analytical, College Station, Texas. CMS Fields is the sole source supplier of repair parts, training, and certification in the safe and competent operation of the MINICAMS line of air-monitoring equipment. There are no authorized distributors or re-sellers of MINICAMS repair or replacement parts in the United States. It has been determined that there are no subcontracting possibilities; therefore a subcontracting plan is not required.</p>

<DESC>Justification Review Document<br />For Other Than Full And Open Competition
<p>1. Contracting Activity: U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, <br />Installation Division, ATTN: CCAP-SCI, 4118 Susquehanna Ave, Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Maryland (MD) 21010-5401.</p>
<p>2. Description of Action:</p>
<p>Requirement: 1 New 0 Repeat<br />Pricing: 1 Firm-Fixed Price 0 Time &amp; Materials 0 Cost<br />Funds: 1 OMA 0 Other Funds:</p>
<p><br />Name of Proposed Contractor: Evex Analytical Instruments, Inc.<br />Street Address: 857 State Road<br />City, State, Zip: Princeton, NJ, 08450<br />Phone: 690-252-9192</p>
<p><br />3. Description of Requirement: This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition seeks the approval to award sole source to Evex Analytical Instruments, Inc. for the Evex MiniSEM electron microscope with integrated elemental analysis capabilities in support of the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), Decontamination Sciences Branch. This requirement will be awarded as a new Firm-Fixed Price Contract under FAR Part 12. The estimated value for the contract is $421,200 and will be obligated with FY12 Operations and Maintenance Army (OMA) funds.</p>
<p>The Decontamination Sciences Branch evaluates the performance of decontaminants for reducing the risk from contaminated materials, including paints, polymers, and impermeable substrates. The Decontamination Sciences mission requires advanced analytical capabilities for evaluating the interactions between the contaminants of interest and military-relevant materials. The instrument will provide rapid and efficient chemical warfare agent transport analysis and characterization.</p>
<p>Specific Instrument Part Numbers:</p>

<p>4. Authority Cited: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as authorized in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br />5. Reason for Authority Cited: <br />In order for the Decontamination Services Branch to fulfill mission-critical tasks, the group will be using this instrument to characterize both the elemental and molecular species distribution on the surface of the sample. This is why the branch needs a scanning electron microscope (high resolution) with an electron dispersive spectrometer (EDS) for the high-resolution elemental characterization of the substrate. The group also needs the complementary Raman spectrometer to confirm that the elements they are looking at correlate to the chemical warfare agents they are studying. Also, many of the materials the group will be evaluating include plastics and paints that do not conduct electricity. The Evex MiniSEM microscope incorporates a proprietary technology for imaging non-conductive substrates, which is a mission critical task for the branch to be successful.</p>
<p>To accommodate the chemistries the group will be evaluating, the instrument needs to be situated in a chemical fume hood, which limits the space requirements, and makes maintenance more challenging. These requirements necessitate a bench top version of the microscope, which is small and lightweight so it can fit in the fume hood. The Evex microscope is the only commercially available microscope in a bench top version which utilizes chemical characterization options needed for testing and evaluation.</p>
<p><br />6. Additional Information:<br />If this instrument is not purchased, the ability to analyze samples will be compromised and the program mission will not be met. These samples will be used to evaluate the threat imposed by several compounds of interest and emerging threats on domestic and military scenario materials. If these samples cannot be analyzed, the ability to thwart terrorism and identity effective decontamination methods may be significantly impacted.</p>
<p>If Evex does not receive the award, no other vendor will be able to provide the required instrument to allow for seamless integration into the lab. The Evex MiniSEM SX3000 is the only system that is compatible with our facilities and engineering controls; the system was specifically designed to accommodate our existing space requirements. Evex is the only worldwide manufacturer that builds both scanning electron microscopes (SEM) and electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system with a single integrated computer control which enables a unique ability to conduct chemical analysis of bulk and nanomaterials. Evex is the only SEM Company providing SEMs with environmental-SEM capabilities called Charge Reduction Module (CRM); this unique capability offers in experiments and imaging of non conductive sample that are of utmost importance to existing Government research in advanced materials. Evex is the only company that could meet the Government specifications of focus range, minimum dwell time, and adjustable landing energy of the electron beam.</p>
<p>7. Actions to Increase Competition: Systems that may have been similar to the Evex MiniSEM have been evaluated in market research but do not encompass all the specifications and characteristics needed. The testing the branch must conduct is very specific which means the microscope needs to fit within those needs. Until another microscope becomes available which will be able to perform all the requirements for testing, Evex holds the proprietary technology.</p>
<p>The EVEX MiniSEM is a "state of the art" electron microscope with integrated elemental analysis capabilities. The Evex system has been evaluated against other competitors (e.g. JEOL NeoScope) and was found to be the only instrument available fitting to branch needs. Evex is the only manufacturer and distributor of instrumentation capable of meeting the high resolution demands of the technical program. Furthermore, Evex is the only manufacturer that manufactures and incorporates 1. Electron dispersive spectrometer for elemental characterization of the substrate; 2. Raman spectrometer for confirmation of molecular species on the substrate; 3. Charge reduction module for imaging/analysis of non-conductive samples; 4. Small foot-print SEM to accommodate engineering controls requirements; 5. Adjustable electron beam energy for customization of image analysis procedures. Evex is the only manufacture that provides these capabilities and support for the instrument.</p>
<p><br />8. Market Research: Market research has been conducted within the last 8 months by the technical POC requiring the instrument. Web searches and consultation with multiple vendors indicate that only this system meets the requirements. Other equipment packages, e.g. JEOL NeoScope, provide bench-top SEM capabilities, but only the Evex MiniSEM integrates each analysis of the chemical interactions between the material and the contaminants of interest. Furthermore, Evex is the only manufacturer that manufacturers and incorporates 1. Small footprint instrument to accommodate engineering control requirements; 2. Integrated electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Ramen spectroscopy for elemental/molecular characterization of the substrate; 3. Peltier-cooled EDS system to increase instrument safety; 4. Charge reduction module to accommodate imaging/analysis of non-conductive samples at high-vacuum conditions; 5. Integrated optical microscope for low magnification imaging; 6. Adjustable beam energy for material-specific imaging methods.</p>
<p>Market research has also been conducted by the contract specialist within the last month and no other small businesses were found to manufacturer any instrument of equal specifications. A search on GSA also yielded no results.</p>
<p>No other manufacture produces a SEM &amp; EDS NanoAnalysis X-Rays System with the aforementioned essential features. Accordingly, the Evex MiniSEM Model: EX3000(FH) is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. Finally, Evex is a 100% small disadvantaged business and has been providing services and manufacturing NanoAnalysis instrumentation since 1993.</p>
<p>9. Procurement History:</p>
<p>Previous Contract or Purchase Order Number: or 1 N/A<br />Previously competed? 1 N/A 0 No 0 Yes<br />Previous authority for other than Full &amp; Open Competition:</p>
<p><br />10. Technical / Requirements Certification: I certify that the support data under my cognizance which is included in this abbreviated-J&amp;A is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Submitted By: Matthew Willis<br />Position Title: Research Chemical Engineer <br />Email address: matthew.p.willis.civ@mail.mil<br />Date: August 15, 2012</p>
<p><br />11. Fair and Reasonable Determination:</p>
<p>I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable in accordance FAR 15.404-1(b)(2), relatively similar prices for products in the same category and the contractors published priced list. Scanning microscopes can cost the Government hundreds of thousands of dollars and to be purchasing a microscope capable of providing the testing and technology to complete mission requirements at a reasonable price is in the best interest of the Government. A historical price search done to view purchases of scanning microscopes from Evex Analytical resulted in an Award Notice published in 2010 for a microscope at the price of $224,000.00. The microscope purchase did not include the necessary accessories ECBC is requiring for testing which could explain the lower price, however, it should be noted how much a microscope, on it's own, could potentially cost.</p>

<DESC>This notice is to advise of USDOT's intent to award, on or about 11/1/2012, a modification #7 to existing Contract No. DTFH61-11-C-00040 with The&nbsp;Regents of the University of Michigan, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI), for the collection of additional weather and contextual traffic data at a select number of locations within and during the USDOT's Safety Pilot Model Deployment initiative in Ann Arbor, Michigan. USDOT competitively awarded Contract No. DTFH61-11-C-00040 on 8/18/2011 to UMTRI. The contract is entitled, "Safety Pilot Model Deployment of Vehicle to Vehicle and Vehicle to Infrastructure Safety Applications." This contract is referred to as the "Test Conductor" contract. The subject contract currently requires that the Test Conductor provide to USDOT data collected from the Vehicle Awareness Devices (VAD), Aftermarket Safety Devices (ASD), and Roadside Equipment (RSE). In order to further enhance the value of the data, USDOT has determined the need to augment this data with weather and contextual traffic data collected from weather and traffic data collection systems. In order for this data to be of value, the data must be collected during the Safety Pilot test and at locations where Safety Pilot field equipment are already deployed. This additional data needs to be integrated with and synchronized (both in terms of time and geospatial location) with the VAD, ASD, and RSE data to be of value. UMTRI is uniquely qualified to effect this necessary integration since UMTRI is currently managing the DSRC data under this Test Conductor contract. As the current Test Conductor, UMTRI is the only source who will have the oversight and access necessary to collect this additional data and integrate it satisfactorily with the data that is already being collected. Since these additional data were not included in the original contract award, a sole source modification is necessary to add the technical tasks necessary to include the additional data in the Model Deployment. To meet this need for collection of weather and contextual traffic data, the Contractor shall:<br />1. Implement weather and contextual traffic data collection systems within the Model Deployment Geographic Area; and <br />2. Update the Model Deployment Site Plan to reflect the installation of this system; and<br />3. Collect the designated weather and contextual traffic data during the Model Deployment and deliver it to USDOT; and<br />4. Deliver meta-data and documented guidance describing how the weather and contextual traffic data can be related to the safety data collected by all other devices in the Model Deployment. <br />
