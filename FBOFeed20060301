The Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Ohio State Office intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) to small business sources capable of providing real estate appraisals throughout the state of Ohio for a period of approximately three years.

The review appraiser must have demonstrated competency in compliance with USPAP in conducting appraisal reviews of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.

History for the last three years is as follows:  FY 2003-24 appraisals; FY-2004-21 appraisals; and FY 2005-24 appraisals.  Changes in the policy require the new appraisals be divided into two parts.  The firs part will be on the entire parcel (not just the WRP area) to appraise it for market value before the easement.  The second part of the appraisal will be on the whole parcel after the easement is in place, the after value.  Technical review will be conducted on the first appraisal from all appraisers and 10% of all appraisals after the first.  An in house administrative review will be conducted on all appraisals.

<DESC>PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.1.3.12.   This is not a solicitation announcement.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is an informational announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents at this time.  The FAA at its nine Regional Offices, two Centers, as well as at headquarters and at other locations, employs a variety of purchasing processes to acquire equipment, services and supplies used in the furtherance of agency missions and goals. Purchasing Processes are defined as the purchase of supplies and services through various means, including purchase cards, interagency agreements, GSA schedules, as well as through direct single source and competitive procurements.   These purchasing processes are generally not closely coordinated across purchasing domains within the agency.  The FAA's Chief Financial Officer has determined that coordination and restructuring of these purchasing processes will lead to reduced costs and increased efficiencies.  One of the major objectives in the FAA Flight Plan is to control costs while delivering quality customer service.  To help achieve the Flight Plan of controlling costs, the FAA has embarked on an important agency-wide strategic sourcing initiative.  This initiative is called Strategic Sourcing for the Acquisition of Various Equipment and Supplies (SAVES) Program. The Program will include all FAA Lines of Business, Staff Offices, Regions, and Centers.     The objective of the SAVES Program is to enable the FAA to purchase selected commodities for less while maintaining or improving quality of purchases and our suppliers' service levels.  Initially, these commodities include: 1) non-National Airspace Systems IT hardware (enterprise servers, peripherals, printers) and software;2) Accounting (ABA) related IT services; 3) general office supplies; 4) office equipment (including leased and purchased copiers); 5) overnight mail; 6) printing; and 7) guard services.  An evaluation of how and from whom the FAA currently purchases these commodities has been conducted. Based on this evaluation, we will be implementing new procurement vehicles such as Basic Purchasing Agreements, Purchase Orders and Contracts. We are striving to have as few procurement vehicles as is practicable contingent on the commodity area. For example, we may have only one for office supplies, one for office equipment, one for overnight mail, and possibly several for Guard Services. With the support of the FAA's Chief Financial Officer, usage of these vehicles will be strongly encouraged agency wide and monitored for compliance so we may realize savings and control costs. All awards will be based on a best value analysis.   We will be releasing Screening Information Requests (SIRs) for each commodity area and will most likely commence with office supplies and equipment SIRs in the March/April time frame with the remaining commodity area SIRs to closely follow. In addition we plan on utilizing the latest electronic processes for online bidding & proposal receipt for the commodity SIRs as appropriate. Additional information and instructions specific to each commodity will be included in those individual commodity area SIRs.    Interested companies can register for future announcements related to this and any procurement by Going to the FAA Website address: "http://www.asu.faa.gov/faaco/index.cfm, which is the "Contract Opportunities" site.  Should you want the e-mail automatic notification of FAA opportunities you may look under the column "Main Menu" and click on e-Mail Auto-Notify System.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this informational announcement.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is an informational announcement. No solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.  Federal Aviation Administration ATTN:  Steven M.

<DESC>Statement of Work For Unique Identification Device (UID) 1.0	Background Item Identification has traditionally been a requirement for DoD programs.  The processes affected by item identification include configuration management, defense specifications, technical documentation, engineering drawing practices, identification marking, transportation, inventory operations, maintenance and logistics support.  Item marking requirements were traditionally expressed in human readable information (HRI) inscribed on data plates, directly on the item, or on packaging.  More recently, automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technology media, such as bar codes, contact memory buttons, and radio frequency identification, have been used to supplement the HRI markings, either as labels, tags, or direct part markings. IUID uses AIDC processes to collect data about an item through media that contains machine-readable information (MRI) in the form of a two-dimensional Data Matrix symbol.  The implementation of IUID requirements means that qualifying items must be marked with MRI encoded into the Data Matrix symbol.  The encoded Data Matrix symbol is called the Unique Item Identifier (UII).  It is marked on an item through the use of a label or by applying the symbol directly to the surface of an item (direct part marking). The basic IUID requirements are contained in an Acting Under Secretary of Defense (USD) Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) Memorandum of July 29, 2003.  On December 23, 2004, the policy was extended to legacy items in inventory and operational use, including Government Property in the Possession of Contractors (PIPC).  On May 12, 2005, additional policy updates were provided. A DFARS final Rule regarding IUID, entitled Item Identification and Valuation, was published in the Federal Register on 22 April 2005 (DFARS Case 2003-D081). MIL-STD-130L, Change 1, which specifies Identification Marking of U.S. Military Property, was published on 20 December 2004 to include practices for IUID.  It provides increased insight and guidance for the implementation of MRI processes for IUID.  HRI item identification may also be necessary for some end users of the identified item.  Finding the most effective use of both, either singly or in combination, is the prime responsibility of the Government requiring activity. In order to meet the DoD requirements, Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) is procuring an IUID Integrated System to mark various legacy systems and equipment in support of In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) and organic depot efforts. 2.0  Scope of Work The contractor shall provide an integrated solution for a proven IUID implementation solution.

The XTS5000 portable radio will be used on the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) to provide portable close range communications. This acquisition is sole source for the following reasons. The XTS5000 portable radios are the same type equipment used on other LCAC and required as part of craft alteration 516K.  Using the same equipment eliminates technical training and provides a direct replacement for existing radios. Motorola, Inc. is the only vendor of the equipment with the features of the Motorola XTS5000 radio for the LCAC. Therefore, this acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018. !   NAICS Code 3345220 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees.   FSC is 5820.  A request for quotation will be utilized in awarding this action on or about 1 April 2006.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate a follow-on contract with Rockefeller University (PI: Dr. Nathaniel Heintz, contact # N01-NS-0-2331, awarded 9/30/00) in order to: 1) continue the high-throughput analysis of gene expression patterns in the mouse nervous system during development; and 2) generate new mouse genetic research tools for the scientific community.  Using two complementary and coordinated technologies (BAC transgenic reporter mice and standard radiometric in situ hybridization), the contract screens probes for a large number (e.g., thousands) of gene products on a relatively limited number (10 to 20) of sections of the nervous system.  Planes of section are chosen by the NINDS to include the structures of most general interest to the neuroscience community (e.g., neocortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum, spinal cord, etc.).  The spatial locations/patterns of gene expression are analyzed at 3 or 4 stages of development (early and late embryonic, and early postnatal) and in adult mice.  The resulting images of gene expression are digitized and posted in Web-accessible databases, and all BAC transgenic mice generated by the contract are deposited in an NIH-sponsored mouse repository.  Background:  With the completion of the Human Genome Project, a major focus of biomedical research is to unravel the functions of the ~22,000 genes expressed in the mammalian genome.  A crucial and often early step in understanding a gene’s function is to decipher where and when a gene is expressed in an organism, both in normal development and under different physiological and pathological conditions.  In neurobiology, the task is even more challenging: the thousands of cell types, the intricate anatomy and elaborate circuitry require sophisticated technologies to reveal patterns of gene expression at a detailed cellular and subcellular level in the nervous system.  The systematic and high-resolution mapping of the distribution of genes in specific cells and circuits promises to yield new insights into brain development, function and disease.  Of the estimated 15,000-16,000 genes expressed in the brain, fewer than a third have been analyzed to any extent and/or have expression data in the CNS, and only a fraction of these are considered to be well-characterized.  Thus, the GENSAT (Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas) contract, awarded to Rockefeller University has developed high-throughput technologies to map the cellular locations of thousands of genes expressed in the mouse CNS throughout development – i.e., from embryonic to early postnatal ages and into adulthood.  GENSAT uses two complementary and coordinated technologies, BAC transgenic reporter mice and standard radiometric in situ hybridization, to create a publicly accessible “4-dimensional map” revealing the spatial locations and patterns of gene expression throughout the brain and spinal cord over developmental age.  As a public resource, all data are posted in Web-accessible databases and all resources including the BAC transgenic mouse lines generated by the contract are deposited in NIH or other public repositories.  New Objectives for the GENSAT Follow-on Contract:  The current GENSAT contract expires at the end of February 2007, and the NINDS intends to negotiate a follow-on contract with Rockefeller University for an additional five years of funding.  Based on the prior successes of the GENSAT project, we expect that the contract will continue to produce outstanding, high-resolution gene expression data on a large scale along with important and powerful new tools for the neuroscience community.  For the next 5-year contract period, the NINDS plans to continue to implement the GENSAT contract as described in the Background Section and will initiate requesting performance of the following:  1.  Increase the throughput of the BAC transgenic component to ~300 genes per year.  This includes a target estimate of approximately 25-50 BAC transgenic lines per year for the creation of state-of-the-art functional genetic tools such as BAC-Cre recombinase “driver” mice (for conditional cell-specific gene manipulation), and BAC-array mice (a new technology that allows the isolation of mRNA from specific cell populations for microarray gene expression profiling).  2.  Increase the throughput of the in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis from 1100 to 1500 genes per year in order to map the expression of ~12,000 nervous system genes by 2012 (the end of the next 5-year contract period).  3.  Continue development and implementation of the infrastructure and bioinformatics of the GENSAT contract.  This includes i) establishing a multi-site data management and (gene) tracking system for both internal and public use; and ii) adopting more sophisticated bioinformatics approaches (e.g., text-based mining approaches, microarray and other expression screens) to aid in gene selection (particularly of novel genes) for GENSAT.  4.  Improve the annotation of the expression data and develop better informatics and/or atlas tools to allow a user easier and enhanced access to the gene expression information in the databases.  This includes conducting finer-level annotation of brain regions and/or specific cell-types in the BAC transgenic mice (particularly important with the targeting of cell-type specific BAC vectors) and annotating the locations/levels of gene expression in the major brain structures of the ISH images.  Create or implement new brain atlas tools which allow the user to analyze more easily the gene expression images and align/compare the expression images with an annotated (anatomical) Nissl reference atlas.  5.  Continue to develop the infrastructure and capabilities to analyze gene expression in other key areas of the nervous system such as the eye and ear and selected peripheral pathways (e.g., DRGs, trigeminal ganglia) in addition to the brain and spinal cord.  This includes generating the BAC transgenic mice on another genetic background (for example, backcrossing the FVB/N transgenic founders to C57Bl6) that is less prone to defects of the eye (or ear) to ensure that the nervous system gene expression is the reflection of functioning sensory structures.  Technical Requirements:  Work under this program requires performance of two interdependent and complementary components for analysis of gene expression in the developing and adult mouse nervous system: Part 1) an initial in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis of large numbers of candidate genes each year; Part 2) a subsequent, more comprehensive analysis of selected genes (generally chosen from the ISH prescreen) in bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-EGFP transgenic reporter mice along with the creation of functional genetic research tools for the scientific community.  First, using radiometric in situ hybridization technology, the contractor shall prepare and deliver expression data for new candidate genes at a target rate of at least 1500 genes per year for the base contract and each option; each gene shall be analyzed at four developmental ages (E11.5, E15.5, P7 and P42) in the brain, spinal cord and retina of mice.  The contractor shall demonstrate the capability of scaling up to a throughput rate of 2500 genes per year if requested by the Government.  The ISH screen will be used to guide the selection of candidate genes for subsequent analysis in BAC-EGFP reporter mice.  Second, for at least 250 of the 1500 candidate genes analyzed in each Option Year, the contractor shall conduct a more thorough analysis of their cellular locations and patterns of expression in the nervous system of BAC-EGFP reporter mice; each gene shall be analyzed at three developmental ages (E15.5, P7 and P42) in the brain, spinal cord and other selected nervous system structures (as specified by the project officer) of BAC-EGFP mice.  The contractor shall demonstrate the capability to increase the gene target throughput rate by 20%, if requested by the Government.  From the BAC-EGFP reporter analysis (and as directed by the NINDS and the GENSAT Advisory Panel), the contractor shall target an additional 25 to 50 genes per year for the generation of state-of-the-art functional genetic research tools for distribution to the scientific community (for example, BAC-Cre recombinase “driver” mice or BAC mice expressing epitope-tagged ribosomal proteins to be used for cell-specific gene expression profiling).  For both the ISH and BAC transgenic analysis, the contractor shall annotate all sections for locations and patterns of gene expression, and shall ensure the quality and accuracy of all data and images submitted to the Government under this contract.  The contractor is expected to maintain a central data management and (gene) tracking system for all contract and subcontract sites (as may be applicable) as described below, and to develop and implement bioinformatic strategies to assist with gene selection/prioritization for the entire project.  Expression images from the contract shall be delivered to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and posted on (or submitted to) other publicly-accessible websites as appropriate.  All BAC transgenic mice generated from the contract will be deposited in the UC Davis Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (MMRRC) or another national repository as directed by the NINDS.  The NINDS believes that the Rockefeller University is the only known source to have the capability for high throughput analysis of gene expression patterns in the mouse nervous system using the technologies and approaches described above and producing outstanding, high-resolution gene expression data that is also consistent and compatible with the data currently in the databases.  At the present time, the NINDS is unaware of any other organization, public or private, that has in place existing capabilities that are at the same development and current level of performance (i.e., the equipment, laboratory, animal facilities, technical expertise or professional capabilities) to compete for this requirement, particularly at the quality, consistency and throughput rate stipulated by the contract.  Inability to produce high-resolution gene expression data on a large scale would lead to delays in the development of the GENSAT database and incurrence of duplicate costs to get to where we are today, both of which would be unacceptable to the Government.  A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302.  The Rockefeller University is considered the only source capable of performing the high throughput analysis and has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise to continue the contract work based on their current experience and work under the contract to date.  See Numbered Note 22.

All solutions must provide for migrating the existing database (estimated at 88 DVDs of 5.1gigs each). The solicitation will have four one-year options for maintenance of the contractor provided hardware and software, following one year of software maintenance and one year of hardware warranty following acceptance of the system.  Award will be made upon a best value basis.  First an offer must be determined technically acceptable.  Of those offers determined to be technically acceptable, the OCC will evaluate past performance and price and award on a best value basis.  This is an unrestricted solicitation which is being processed in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.   The solicitation will be posted on FedBizOps on or about 6 March 2006 with a one week response time. E-mail submission are authorized andmust be received by the date and time established in the solicitatioin for receipt of offers (however it is incumbent upon the offeror to ensure that all the required information is provided with such e-mail submissions, the same as if it were provided by hand, courier, or mail).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, intends to award a sole source acquisition to the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 for the Information Technology Laboratory, Spoken Language Processing Group, for a one year base period with two one-year option periods. The Speech Group is currently working with another Government agency (DAPRA) that has contracted with LDC for similar services. This effort, along with efforts by NIST has produced several standards and methods for creating these resources.

This follow-on work is intended to supply NIST with research-quality linguistic resources for testing several types of language technology systems. The requirement will  include four main components: (1) producing high quality transcripts of recorded, multi-person meetings, (2) producing quick transcripts of recorded multi-person meetings, (3) producing multiple, independent research-oriented translations of contractor-supplied source documents in Mandarin and MSA Arabic from appropriate sources from specified time periods and providing human assessments of the fluency and accuracy of machine translation systems, and (4) distribution of Linguistic Data Consortium owned corpora (i.e., collection of linguistic resources), to researchers. The technical requirements to fulfill components 1, 2, and 3 are not net by typical transcription or translation services. The specified deliverables require high degrees of accuracy, non-standard textual representations, and precisely controlled content segmentation rules. Component 4 is only distributed by the LDC. As a not-for-profit entity, the LDC is uniquely qualified to prepare these resources in that their staff is highly knowledgeable on the technical and linguistic requirements and they have an established quality control infrastructure that can fulfill the required accuracy, additionally, they maintain a large staff of linguistic academic personnel, and sufficient high performance computational resources needed to complete these tasks.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a single source under the authority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. Interested parties capable of responding to the requirement may submit a capability statement specifically identifying their ability to accomplish this requirement. Responses are due within seven days after the publication of this notice. Responses shall be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition following consideration of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Announcement of New Consent-Based Social Security Number Verification (CBSV) Service by the Social Security Administration (SSA)

SSA is planning to offer a new service to any interested parties.  As long as the party first obtains the required written consent of the number holder, we will, for a fee, verify a name and Social Security number combination as being correct (or incorrect) for any party registered to use the service.  There also will be a substantial fee to register to use the service because Social Security Trust Fund monies cannot be used to develop this service.  This new service is contingent on OMB approval.  Currently, we anticipate a May or June 2006 start date for the service.  There will be a limited time for parties to enroll in this service.  Once the enrollment period ends, there could be as much as a 3- year wait before additional companies will be permitted to enroll.

Please see Federal Register Notice Social Security Administration:  Agency Information Collection Activities:  Proposed Request, dated December 30, 2005, for more information about this service and to request documents such as the User Agreement that the party would sign with SSA and the consent form that must be completed by the Social Security number holder prior to you being permitted to send a request for Social Security number verification to SSA for processing.

Announcement of New Consent-Based Social Security Number Verification (CBSV) Service by the Social Security Administration (SSA)

SSA is planning to offer a new service to any interested parties.  As long as the party first obtains the required written consent of the number holder, we will, for a fee, verify a name and Social Security number combination as being correct (or incorrect) for any party registered to use the service.  There also will be a substantial fee to register to use the service because Social Security Trust Fund monies cannot be used to develop this service.  This new service is contingent on OMB approval.  Currently, we anticipate a May or June 2006 start date for the service.  There will be a limited time for parties to enroll in this service.  Once the enrollment period ends, there could be as much as a 3- year wait before additional companies will be permitted to enroll.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Using a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the US Army Aviation & Missile Research, Development & Engineering Center (USA AMRDEC), Applied Technology Initiatives Directorate (ATI) is interested in receiving proposals from offerors capable of sa tisfying Government requirements for research and development utilizing new and innovative technologies to advance the capabilities in Applied Technology for interceptor technologies and defense infrastructure technologies.  Proposals with new and innovati ve technologies are needed which could enhance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge for the following areas:  Proposals should address one of the technical areas listed:  A:  INTERCEPTOR TECHNOLOGIES, 1. Interceptor Systems, 2. Threat Negation Sys tems, 3. Simulation and Modeling Systems, 4. Command, Control & Communications Systems, 5. Networks, 6. System Interoperability, 7. System Requirements, 8. Other Applicable Interceptor Applied Technology Systems, and B:   DEFENSE INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGIE S (AIR, CRUISE MISSILE, ARMOR, FORCE PROTECTION AND OTHER), 1. Interceptor Systems, 2. Integrated Missile Systems, 3. Simulation and Modeling,  4. Target Systems, 5. Transportation Systems, 6. System Operational Analysis, 7. Battle Management Systems, 8. F ire Control Systems, 9. Directed Energy Systems, 10. Other Applicable Defense Infrastructure Applied Technologies.  All development activities related to this BAA are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Performance will require ac cess to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, Executive Order 12470, and/or DOD Directive 5230.25.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firms.  Any contractor or subcontractor considering this BAA can not have foreign nationals working on the effort. Foreign Nationals (also known as foreign persons) means any person who is NOT a citizen or national of the US; or a lawful permanent resident; or a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C 13 24b(a)(3). In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that the offerors first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation. From this sum mary concept paper the Government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Government and whether a formal proposal would be likely to succeed.  The Government, at its option, may provide comments that might be of  assistance to the submitter in determining how or whether to submit a BAA proposal.   Concept papers will be evaluated as soon as they are received.  Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will not be made, and concept papers will not be returned. The Contracting Office will ask only those offerors with promising concept papers to submit full technical and cost proposals.  The Contracting Office will notify offerors within 90 days of receipt of concept paper if a full proposal is requested.  Concept  papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data.  All proprietary material should be clearly marked. The summary concept paper should state the proposed technical concept including the ration ale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and its contribution to the USA AMRDEC.  In addition, the summary concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost and offerors past performance on Government contracts. The concept p aper shall be limited to 5 pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), of English text with one additional page for technical drawing if necessary, and shall be in MS Word for Windows format.  All concept papers, proposals, written communications or documentation co ncerning this BAA shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer,  Ms. Debra Scruggs, via e-mail debra.scruggs@us.army.mil, with a copy to Ms. Camille Jones, via  e-mail camille.jones@us.army.mil.  Facsimile proposal submission is not authorized under this announcement.  No classified data shall be included in the concept paper or proposal. A review of concept papers by the Government will determine which efforts a re of sufficient interest to merit a formal proposal.  Concept papers will be evaluated based on technical merit and offerors past performance. Technical merit will rank significantly higher than past performance. If there is sufficient interest, a formal proposal will be requested.  Contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals unless invited to do so by the Contracting Office.  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay fo r any response preparation costs. The cost of proposal preparation or response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract and interested parties should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be p ublished. Proposals may range from theoretical studies to a proof-of-concept that includes fabrication, delivery and test of prototypes. USA AMRDEC is interested in receiving proposals for the research efforts described under this BAA. USA AMRDEC contracts  with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those technical areas listed above.  Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract. Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee completion and/or level of effo rt type contracts are expected to be awarded.  For planning purposes, awards are anticipated in the $100K to $30M range for the basic contract with a period of performance not to exceed 36 months.  In addition to the basic contract, up to four options can be proposed.  However, the total contract value (of each individual contract) for the basic and options cannot exceed $75M and the total period of performance for the basic and options cannot exceed 60 months.  This includes time for preparation, approval,  and distribution of the final report.  The following reports may be required (specific reporting requirements will be specified by the Government in the event a contractor is requested to submit a formal proposal):  1. FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPOR T, DI-FNCL-80331/M, monthly; 2. TECHNICAL REPORT, DI-MISC-80508, as required and a one time Final report; 3. STATUS REPORTS, DI-MGMT-80368, monthly; 4.

PERIODIC PROGRAM REVIEWS (such as IPRs, SRRs, SDRs, etc.), as required.  7.  DA Manpower Reporting Requirements.   Long term proposals should contain a summary of the work contemplated for each 12-month period, so that contract s may be negotiated for an entire five-year project or for individual one-year increments of the total project.  A detailed performance schedule for each discrete task must be included along with cost data to include labor-by-labor category. To be eligible  for award of a contract, a prospective contractor must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, and ability to comply with the performance schedule. This acquisition is not open to foreign participation at any level.  The Governme nt will provide selected offerors with proposal content requirements. Proposal content and format shall contain and not be limited to: (1)  Statement of Work (SOW): The SOW should be a concise document suitable for incorporation into a resultant contract.  It should provide a qualitative description of the proposed work, which should be described in terms of advancement, improvement, or end product to be developed.  The SOW should state the objectives to be achieved and how these objectives would benefit th e Government.  These objectives should be stated in terms of their potential usefulness to the Research & Development and Warfighter communities at and supporte d by the USA AMRDEC. The SOW should also include a proposed schedule detailing significant milestones and deliverables. (2)  One page Resumes of the offeror's key personnel (including alternates, if desired) who will be involved in the research.  Documenta tion of previous work or experience in the field of the proposer is especially important. (3)  The type of support, if any, the offeror requests of the USA AMRDEC, such as facilities, equipment, or materials. Any request by offerors for Government furnishe d property/equipment must be clearly identified in the proposal. The Government is under no obligation to comply with such requests. Thus, offerors should make provisions for alternate approaches in the event the Government is unwilling or unable to provid e the requested property/equipment. (4)  A statement regarding possible impact, if any, of the proposal's effect on the environment. (5)  A brief description of your organization.  (6)  The facilities to be used for the work, if appropriate for and underst anding of the proposal. (7) A listing of current similar R&D contracts along with Government POCs (contracting officer & technical) shall be included. The financial portion of the proposal should contain a cost estimate that is sufficiently detailed by ele ment of cost for meaningful evaluation and must include sufficient detail to support and explain all costs proposed, giving figures and narrative explanation.  Cost proposals must contain certifiable cost or pricing data, and shall be in sufficient detail to allow direct and indirect rate verification.  The budget must include the total estimated cost of the project.  The estimated project costs must be broken down for each year of the program to show the following: (1)  A list of participants, not necessar ily by name, showing the time and number of direct productive person hours (DPPHs) to be charged by principal investigator(s), research associates, and assistants, and the total amount per year to be paid to each from the project.  For proposals from unive rsities, the time and amounts to be charged should be identified by academic year and summer effort. (2)  An itemized list of permanent equipment showing the cost of each item. Permanent equipment is any article of non-expendable tangible personal property  having a useful life of more than two years, and an acquisition cost of $500 or more per unit. (3)  A general description and total estimated cost of expendable equipment and supplies. (4)  Contemplated expenditures for travel with brief explanation.  Tra vel budgets that exceed $1,500 per principal investigator per year or that include foreign travel or travel by other than principal investigators will require special investigation. (5) Other direct costs. (6)  Cost for consulting services, if any, showing  number of days, daily rates, and estimated travel/per diem costs.  The need for consulting services must be fully justified. (7)  Indirect costs indicating whether rates used are fixed or provisional, and the time frames to which they are applicable (e.g. , a fixed rate may apply until a specified date, after which the rate becomes provisional). (8)  The fee, if any, which the organization proposes to assess the research project. (9)  Subcontracts and material costs proposed must be fully supported and docu mented (written quotes, engineering estimates, etc).  Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors perfo rming work or rendering services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy. Subcontracting goals for small business are 40%, for veteran owned small busi ness 3%, for service disabled veteran owned small business 3%, Hubzone small business 3%, small disadvantaged business (includes HBCUs/MIs) 5%, and women-owned small business 5%. These goals are to be considered when proposals are submitted.  The Government anticipates that any contract resulting from this BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22 Limitation of Funds.  Proposals wi ll be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical merit, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.  Management, cost realism and reasonableness, and past performance shall also be considered.  The following factors will be considered in the evaluation of proposals received under this BAA. General: The government selection of the proposal(s) for award will be based o n an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical and management in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance, using the area s and factors set forth below. The Government anticipates multiple awards under this announcement, though no minimum or maximum number of awards can be guaranteed.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPON SES RECEIVED. Evaluation Factors for Technical Area: a. Overall Scientific/Technical Quality: The offeror will be evaluated on the overall scientific/technical merits of the proposed research and development.  The scientific/technical merits may include po tential for state-of-the-art improvement, with special emphasis on innovation, originality and uniqueness. b. Qualifications: Capabilities and qualifications of the key research personnel relevant offeror experience and adequacy of facilities and instrumen tation as required. The offeror shall also be evaluated on past technical performance of current similar R&D contracts. c. Research and Development Contribution: Potential contribution of the proposed research to USA AMRDEC in the above technology areas. E valuation Factors Management Area: a. Overall Scheduling and Planning: The offeror's approach will be evaluated based on the overall scheduling and planning for performance of the effort. b. Expenditure Control: The approach for controlling expenditures an d labor hours. c. Past Performance: The offeror's past performance for similar work will be considered. Evaluation Factors Cost Area: a. Cost Realism: The proposal will be evaluated to assess the likelihood that the technical and management approaches prop osed could be accomplished at the cost proposed. b. Total Evaluated Probable Cost: The proposal will be evaluated to develop the government's estimate of the most probable cost to the government of successfully completing the contract using the technical a nd management approaches proposed.  Relative Importance of Evaluation Criteria: 1. Technical:  The technical area is significantly more important than the management area.  The factors under the technical area are of equal importance. 2. Management:  The m anagement area is significantly less important than the technical area.  The factors under the management area are of equal importance. 3. Cost: Although the technical and management areas are more important than the cost area, cost is still considered a s ignificant evaluation factor. Proposed costs must be fully detailed and have a complete justification. The total proposed cost must be within the total contract value as specified in the Introduction of this BAA. Selection of proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical and management in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance.  In som e cases the merits of a particular proposal in a technical discipline may lead to a decision with respect to funds availability relevant to the Applied Technolo gy Initiatives Directorate customer goals.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Contract(s)  based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit  the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs.  This BAA shall remain in effect for a period of one-year from date of synopsis.

<DESC>The point of contact is Patricia Ortiz, Purchasing Agent, Phone 206-764-3516, Fax 206-764-6817 or email patricia.a.ortiz@usace.army.mil. The purpose of the study is to monitor the downstream migration of juvenile salmon (smolts), Coho, Chinook, Chum, and Cutthroat, moving through the dam removal area on Goldsborough Creek.  Goldsborough Creek smolt migration data will provide the Corps info rmation regarding the effectiveness the dam removal and placement of cement weirs.  Primarily whether Oncorhynchus spp. (pacific salmon) are able to make it up past the project area as adults to spawn and that smolts are surviving outmigration through the project area.   The approach is to monitor downstream outmigration timing of Coho Salmon smolts using weirs and mark/recapture methodology.  Enumeration and estimation of outmigrating smolts will be used to provide data to estimate natural Coho Salmon production and begin  to form relevant spawning escapement goals.  In the ensuing years adult escapement has been variable and the spawning escapement goals were passive.  Specific objectives of this effort are to determine the current downstream smolt outmigration timing and level of smolt production in Goldsborough, Mill, and Cranberry Creeks in the Hammersly Inlet/Oakland Bay watershed and in Skookum Creek in the Totten/Skookum Inlet watershed.  In addition, the information collected on outmigrants will begin the first step to produce a spawner/recruit relationship that will help set adult spawning escapement goals.

<DESC>BOSS HSCG23-06-R-HXZ001  VENDOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

FedBizOps POSTING  1 March 2006 

1.  Q:  The labor category description (page 58) for the Marine Surveyor requires that “Personnel provided would be required to be a member in good standing of the Society of Marine Surveyors (SAMS)”.  Will you accept “National Association of Marine Surveyors (NAMS) – Certified Marine Surveyors (CMS) (NAMS-CMS) in lieu of SAMS?

A:  Yes.  Please note that an amendment will be issued for RFP Section J, Attachment D, changing the experience criteria for the Marine Surveyor, first sentence only, from that currently shown to:

Personnel provided would be required to be a member in good standing of the Society of Accredited Marine Surveyors or the National Association of Marine Surveyors – Certified Marine Surveyors. 

2.  Q:  Are subcontractor Representations and Certifications required in Volume IV?

A:  Yes, to the extent an offeror that proposes subcontractor personnel must submit whatever portions of RFP Section K are applicable to a particular subcontractor.  Each provision in Section K should be individually considered for requirement and effect.  While the term “offeror” in the context of a certification generally refers to the proposed prime contractor,  certain clauses do require subcontractor certification.  For example, FAR 52.203-11(b)(3) requires a like certification by subcontractors under a subcontract in excess of $100,000.  Thus, if an offeror proposes subcontractor personnel under a subcontract that has the potential to exceed $100,000, that subcontractor’s representations, certifications, or other statements should be submitted.  For offerors who submit subcontractor Representations and Certifications, subcontractor DUNS numbers may be provided in a proposal that will allow access to a subcontractor’s Online Representation and Certification Application (ORCA) (see RFP page 89, paragraph (b)). 

3.  Q:  Will you provide a listing of the bidder’s list?

A:  The Government sent the BOSS RFP directly to the vendors listed below.  

Software Performance Systems, Inc.
Navigant Consulting, Inc.
Federal Sources, Inc.
Allyn International Services, Inc.
Deloitte Services LP
ICF Consulting

Preferred Systems Solutions, Inc.
High Performance Technologies, Inc.
RGL Gallagher LLP

4.  Q:  Are (you) able to accept responses that address only portions of the RFP but may not address the entire RFP?  

A:  Proposals must respond to all requirements of the solicitation, as set forth in RFP Section L.2, 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors – Competitive Acquisition, and Section L.6, Submission of Written Proposals – Competitive.  Proposals submitted with inadequate information may be found unacceptable.

5.  Q:  Is it acceptable to respond to the Claims Adjudication and Natural Resources Damage Claims and not the Professional Engineer portion of the project?

A:    See answer to Question No. 4 above.

<DESC>MARCH 1, 2006.

THE ABOVE REFERENCED NOTICE IS MODIFIED AS FOLLOWS:

AMENDMENT 1/ QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.  RFQ 06M000014


Q.  Is there a list of ATR enrolled or participating faith-based and community organization (FBO) providers in the subject five states and may we have that list?
A: No there is not. You would have to identify prospective ATR/ FBOs who meet the state recovery and treatment standards and requirements.

Q.  In the Background section, you state that this initiative has been faced with “obstructive challenges” to recruitment.  Can you elaborate and expand on the nature of these challenges?
A:  Primarily, it is a difference between the two organizational cultures and structures. Government does not quite understand faith based organizations on a whole and faith based organizations have many myths about governmental involvement in public affairs.

Q:  In the Synopsis you state that this “award shall be a fixed-price, simplified acquisition,” yet in Attachment A, Instructions to Offerors, in Volume II – Business Proposal, you require the offeror to provide a cost breakdown for each task, including the number of hours and hourly rate and all other direct costs.  Will this contract be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract or as a time and materials contract?
A: Firm fixed price order

Q:  Are there any existing materials, brochures, etc. for this program, as Task 4 requires the contractor to develop any materials “not already in existence?”  If such materials exist, may we see copies?
A: Please visit the SAMHSA website for ATR resources and information.

Q:  Is it expected that the conferences will include training on substance abuse recovery?  If so, would that training be provided by HHS or by the contractor? 
A:  Yes, substance abuse recovery may be included in the training.  The expectation is that the contractor will be provide all of the training and technical assistance.
 

Q:  Are there any meetings/conferences already planned in any of the enumerated states?
A: I can not identify any training events at this point but once the contract is awarded  I will provide that information.

Q: In Attachment A, in the Specific Approach to Statement of Work, you stress “facilitators” and “facilitation.”  To which Task or Tasks in the Statement of Work does this refer?
A:  Facilitation in this context means assistance. The contractor is required to assist each FBO     with meeting the requirements of full participation in the ATR program.

Q:  In your Statement of Work, Task 3, you indicate the contractor shall conduct a total of up to 10 site visits to ATR grantee states or convene up to 10 technical assistance events.  The proposed Schedule of Deliverable and Payment actually indicates a total of 15 site visits or TA events.  Should we assume there is a flexibility to do as many as 15 site visits to the 5 designated states?
A:  No, we expect that you will conduct ten technical assistance activities (3 in each state). This may include site visits as many as five.


  

Q:  Task 1.3.  What is the government’s estimate of the amount time will be needed by the CSAT Office of the Director for consultation? 
A: The government’s estimate of the amount time with the Office of the Director is minimum. Most of your time will be spent providing technical assistance to potential ATR/FBOs.


Q:  Task 1.4.  How long do the weekly ATR meetings last? 
A: The weekly meeting is one hour in duration.


Q: Task 3.1.  What is the government’s estimate of the amount of time needed by the CSAT Office of the Director related to TA and training related to capacity development? 
A: The government’s estimate of the amount time with the Office of the Director is minimum. Most of your time will be spent providing technical assistance to potential ATR/FBOs.

Q: Where can a copy of the SAMHSA TA participant satisfaction and follow up survey be found? 
A:  The GPRA evaluation can be accessed through the SAMHSA website.

Q:  Are the expenses of attendees at TA and/or training events to be paid for under the procurement?  
A:  I am not sure about the type of expenses you speak about.

Q:  What does the government anticipate will be the ratio of TA visits to training events for all of the 10 States?  What is the anticipated duration for each TA visit and training event?
A: The government does not have a particular ratio of TA visits vs. training events. These are determined by the contractor according to TA needs of FBOs.

Q: Would the government consider extending the deadline for submission, given that the responses to these questions will affect budgeting for this project and given that the deadline for submitting questions is only one week prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals?
A: No, the government will not accept a deadline extension.
  
Q:  In the evaluation criteria there is mention of several personnel positions, including Administrator, Moderator, and Facilitation Coordinator, in addition to Facilitators.  Is it the government’s expectation that bidders include each of these positions in its proposal? 
A: The government expects the contractor to employ appropriate staff to carry out the requirements of the purchase order. 
 
Q:  What are the topics or core elements of training that are expected to be covered?
      A:  The contractor is expected to assess the TA needs of the FBOs and customize TA and     training meet the needs of FBOs.

Q:  Under the ‘Monthly/Payments to be determined’ Schedule the are some problems with the information provided, including: 

•	July 10, 2006 is listed twice ( July, June, July)
•	For August 10, 2006  task 2-1 is listed, but there is no similar task in the SOW
•	September 10, 2006 has no tasks 3, 4, and 5, which would follow the other monthly entries.  
Please clarify these items.
A:   The month following should be August instead of July. Months should follow normal sequences. 
 
Q:  What is the anticipated level of effort for this project?
      A:  The anticipated level effort is determined by the time that it takes the contractor to complete tasks satisfactorily.
 

Q:  In Task 2, the SOW requires the contractor to be responsible for managing, monitoring and improving the participation of FBOs in the ATR program.  What does the government mean when it asks the contractor to manage the participation of the FBOs in the ATR program? 
      A:  The contractor is required to assist each FBO with meeting the requirements of full participation in the ATR program.

Q: Regarding Task 3:  What is the maximum number of non federal attendees that will be included in the site visits or TA events? 
A:  It is expected that at least 20 FBO representatives will be included in the site visits or TA events.

Q: Regarding Task 4:  What is the government’s estimate of how much advance notice will be given provided to secure acceptable meeting sites and hotel accommodations, provide pre-meeting logistical services, etc. for each TA event? 
      A:   This is determined by the contractor. The contractor is responsible for meeting logistics, planning and executing.

Q:  Is there an incumbent performing the required services? If yes, can that firm re bid on this opportunity?
A:  There is no incumbent.

Q:  Since this is a “firm fixed price purchase order,” are the Other Direct Costs (ODC’s-travel hotel meeting rooms etc.) considered in the evaluation review? Or, is the “firm fixed purchase order” refer only to labor costs?
A: The firm fixed price is inclusive of labor and other direct cost (travel, meeting rooms, hotel, etc). 


Q: Please explain the notation in Task 4? Does this statement mean that during any breaks no refreshments will be provided even if this item is considered to be part of the meeting room rental costs? Or, that HHS will not reimburse the cost of refreshments f are not to be considered?
A: Refreshments/ food can not be paid for out of HHS funds by law.


Q: Are break out meeting rooms required?
A:  Break out rooms will be determined by the awarded contractor based on assessment of FBO TA needs. 

      Q:  What audio visual equipment will be required?
A:  Audio visual aids as needed will be provided by the contractor.

Q: Who prepares the resource material for distribution and use during the technical assistance events? 
A:  The contractor prepares, procures and identifies materials and resources as well as disseminates them as needed. 

      Q:  Who are the facilitators? Are they selected by the vendor with HHS approval? Or, provided by HHS? Will the facilitators be the only presenters of technical assistance to the faith based grantee recipients? 
      A:   The contractor is the facilitator. It is the contractor’s responsibility to choose whoever is most qualified to carry out the tasks and complete deliverables of the awarded purchase order. 
 
Q:  Who pays for the facilitator fees? If they are gov’t (HHS) staff is their travel costs and per diem covered by their direct program budget? 
A:  The participants are responsible for all expenses related to transportation and accommodation. 

Q: Beside the 20 non federal participants how many SAMHSA/CSAT staff will attend? What is the average number of participants that have attended previous or similar SAMSHA/CSAT ATR program events?
A:  The contractor should have the capacity to identify the best resources including business plans to be used for TA. 


Q: Do the participants pay their own transportation and accommodations costs?
A:  Since the contractor is the facilitator, all cost incurred is the sole responsibility of the contractor. 


Q: This appears to be a one year effort. Is there an opportunity of any option years being considered?
A: This is a one year purchase order. 

Q:Where can the vendor locate the necessary REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTICIFATION FORMS required for inclusion in the Business Plan submission?

THE ABOVE REFERENCED NOTICE IS MODIFIED AS FOLLOWS:

AMENDMENT 1/ QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.  RFQ 06M000014


Q.  Is there a list of ATR enrolled or participating faith-based and community organization (FBO) providers in the subject five states and may we have that list?
A: No there is not. You would have to identify prospective ATR/ FBOs who meet the state recovery and treatment standards and requirements.

Q.  In the Background section, you state that this initiative has been faced with “obstructive challenges” to recruitment.  Can you elaborate and expand on the nature of these challenges?
A:  Primarily, it is a difference between the two organizational cultures and structures. Government does not quite understand faith based organizations on a whole and faith based organizations have many myths about governmental involvement in public affairs.

Q:  In the Synopsis you state that this “award shall be a fixed-price, simplified acquisition,” yet in Attachment A, Instructions to Offerors, in Volume II – Business Proposal, you require the offeror to provide a cost breakdown for each task, including the number of hours and hourly rate and all other direct costs.  Will this contract be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract or as a time and materials contract?
A: Firm fixed price order

Q:  Are there any existing materials, brochures, etc. for this program, as Task 4 requires the contractor to develop any materials “not already in existence?”  If such materials exist, may we see copies?
A: Please visit the SAMHSA website for ATR resources and information.

Q:  Is it expected that the conferences will include training on substance abuse recovery?  If so, would that training be provided by HHS or by the contractor? 
A:  Yes, substance abuse recovery may be included in the training.  The expectation is that the contractor will be provide all of the training and technical assistance.
 

Q:  Are there any meetings/conferences already planned in any of the enumerated states?
A: I can not identify any training events at this point but once the contract is awarded  I will provide that information.

Q: In Attachment A, in the Specific Approach to Statement of Work, you stress “facilitators” and “facilitation.”  To which Task or Tasks in the Statement of Work does this refer?
A:  Facilitation in this context means assistance. The contractor is required to assist each FBO     with meeting the requirements of full participation in the ATR program.

Q:  In your Statement of Work, Task 3, you indicate the contractor shall conduct a total of up to 10 site visits to ATR grantee states or convene up to 10 technical assistance events.  The proposed Schedule of Deliverable and Payment actually indicates a total of 15 site visits or TA events.  Should we assume there is a flexibility to do as many as 15 site visits to the 5 designated states?
A:  No, we expect that you will conduct ten technical assistance activities (3 in each state). This may include site visits as many as five.


  

Q:  Task 1.3.  What is the government’s estimate of the amount time will be needed by the CSAT Office of the Director for consultation? 
A: The government’s estimate of the amount time with the Office of the Director is minimum. Most of your time will be spent providing technical assistance to potential ATR/FBOs.


Q:  Task 1.4.  How long do the weekly ATR meetings last? 
A: The weekly meeting is one hour in duration.


Q: Task 3.1.  What is the government’s estimate of the amount of time needed by the CSAT Office of the Director related to TA and training related to capacity development? 
A: The government’s estimate of the amount time with the Office of the Director is minimum. Most of your time will be spent providing technical assistance to potential ATR/FBOs.

Q: Where can a copy of the SAMHSA TA participant satisfaction and follow up survey be found? 
A:  The GPRA evaluation can be accessed through the SAMHSA website.

Q:  Are the expenses of attendees at TA and/or training events to be paid for under the procurement?  
A:  I am not sure about the type of expenses you speak about.

Q:  What does the government anticipate will be the ratio of TA visits to training events for all of the 10 States?  What is the anticipated duration for each TA visit and training event?
A: The government does not have a particular ratio of TA visits vs. training events. These are determined by the contractor according to TA needs of FBOs.

Q: Would the government consider extending the deadline for submission, given that the responses to these questions will affect budgeting for this project and given that the deadline for submitting questions is only one week prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals?
A: No, the government will not accept a deadline extension.
  
Q:  In the evaluation criteria there is mention of several personnel positions, including Administrator, Moderator, and Facilitation Coordinator, in addition to Facilitators.  Is it the government’s expectation that bidders include each of these positions in its proposal? 
A: The government expects the contractor to employ appropriate staff to carry out the requirements of the purchase order. 
 
Q:  What are the topics or core elements of training that are expected to be covered?
      A:  The contractor is expected to assess the TA needs of the FBOs and customize TA and     training meet the needs of FBOs.

Q:  Under the ‘Monthly/Payments to be determined’ Schedule the are some problems with the information provided, including: 

•	July 10, 2006 is listed twice ( July, June, July)
•	For August 10, 2006  task 2-1 is listed, but there is no similar task in the SOW
•	September 10, 2006 has no tasks 3, 4, and 5, which would follow the other monthly entries.  
Please clarify these items.
A:   The month following should be August instead of July. Months should follow normal sequences. 
 
Q:  What is the anticipated level of effort for this project?
      A:  The anticipated level effort is determined by the time that it takes the contractor to complete tasks satisfactorily.
 

Q:  In Task 2, the SOW requires the contractor to be responsible for managing, monitoring and improving the participation of FBOs in the ATR program.  What does the government mean when it asks the contractor to manage the participation of the FBOs in the ATR program? 
      A:  The contractor is required to assist each FBO with meeting the requirements of full participation in the ATR program.

Q: Regarding Task 3:  What is the maximum number of non federal attendees that will be included in the site visits or TA events? 
A:  It is expected that at least 20 FBO representatives will be included in the site visits or TA events.

Q: Regarding Task 4:  What is the government’s estimate of how much advance notice will be given provided to secure acceptable meeting sites and hotel accommodations, provide pre-meeting logistical services, etc. for each TA event? 
      A:   This is determined by the contractor. The contractor is responsible for meeting logistics, planning and executing.

Q:  Is there an incumbent performing the required services? If yes, can that firm re bid on this opportunity?
A:  There is no incumbent.

Q:  Since this is a “firm fixed price purchase order,” are the Other Direct Costs (ODC’s-travel hotel meeting rooms etc.) considered in the evaluation review? Or, is the “firm fixed purchase order” refer only to labor costs?
A: The firm fixed price is inclusive of labor and other direct cost (travel, meeting rooms, hotel, etc). 


Q: Please explain the notation in Task 4? Does this statement mean that during any breaks no refreshments will be provided even if this item is considered to be part of the meeting room rental costs? Or, that HHS will not reimburse the cost of refreshments f are not to be considered?
A: Refreshments/ food can not be paid for out of HHS funds by law.


Q: Are break out meeting rooms required?
A:  Break out rooms will be determined by the awarded contractor based on assessment of FBO TA needs. 

      Q:  What audio visual equipment will be required?
A:  Audio visual aids as needed will be provided by the contractor.

Q: Who prepares the resource material for distribution and use during the technical assistance events? 
A:  The contractor prepares, procures and identifies materials and resources as well as disseminates them as needed. 

      Q:  Who are the facilitators? Are they selected by the vendor with HHS approval? Or, provided by HHS? Will the facilitators be the only presenters of technical assistance to the faith based grantee recipients? 
      A:   The contractor is the facilitator. It is the contractor’s responsibility to choose whoever is most qualified to carry out the tasks and complete deliverables of the awarded purchase order. 
 
Q:  Who pays for the facilitator fees? If they are gov’t (HHS) staff is their travel costs and per diem covered by their direct program budget? 
A:  The participants are responsible for all expenses related to transportation and accommodation. 

Q: Beside the 20 non federal participants how many SAMHSA/CSAT staff will attend? What is the average number of participants that have attended previous or similar SAMSHA/CSAT ATR program events?
A:  The contractor should have the capacity to identify the best resources including business plans to be used for TA. 


Q: Do the participants pay their own transportation and accommodations costs?
A:  Since the contractor is the facilitator, all cost incurred is the sole responsibility of the contractor.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to extend the registration closing date from March 2, 2006 at 2:00 P.M. to March 7, 2006 C.O.B. 

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  In accordance with the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) statute, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will host a Tire Privatization Industry Day on Thursday, March 9, 2006, at the Defense Supply Center, Columbus (DSCC), Columbus, OH.

The purpose of this Industry Day is to discuss establishing a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) approach for the supply chain management of tires for the Department of Defense.  Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for tires (Federal Supply Classes 2610, 2620, and 2630) became law on November 8, 2005.  This recommendation is intended to create a more responsive supply support to user organizations and deployment, and the sustainment of forces when deployed worldwide.  Privatization enables the Department to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translate into improved support to customers at less cost.  This recommendation disestablishes the wholesale supply, storage, and distribution functions for all tires used by the Department of Defense, retaining only the supply contracting function.  The Department will privatize these functions and will rely on private industry for the performance of supply, storage, and distribution of these commodities.  By doing so, the Department can divest itself of inventories and can eliminate infrastructure and personnel associated with these functions.  This Industry Day is for informational purposes only.  The Government will present several briefings to broadly address BRAC requirements, the Army and Air Force Tire programs, Distribution, Disposal and the acquisition strategy for the privatization of tires.  DLA is interested in receiving industry comments, recommendations, and ideas regarding this initiative.  The agenda will include a time for questions and answers as well as informal discussions.  Written comments will also be accepted.

Final registration is due by Thursday, March 2, 2006, 2:00 PM EST.  To register, please send an email to Kathy Manley (614)692-2258, at DSCC.Tires@dla.mil  with your company name and address, CAGE code, names of attendees, and a primary point of contact to include telephone number and e-mail address.

<DESC>2006 Design-Bid-Build Brussels Chancery Renovation and Rehabilitation Project

CHANCERY RENOVATION  QUALIFICATION ONLY 

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is seeking to pre-qualify firms for Design-Bid-Build construction services for the renovation of an existing office building, Bi-lateral Mission Chancery, Brussels, Belgium. The construction contract is expected to be awarded prior to September 30, 2006. Actually, construction is not expected to begin until issuance of a Notice to Proceed. Performance period of this project from Notice to Proceed issuance is anticipated to be 18 months. This project does require the use of cleared American workers. The contract type for this project will be firm fixed-price. Award of this contract is subject to the availability of funds. 



SALMEC-06-R0038: Brussels, Belguim, Chancery Renovation and Rehabilitation: 6,000 gsm, Estimated Bid Build cost range $10 to $15 million.

Background Information

This US Government owned Chancery, constructed by the Department in 1952 is situated on a one-third acre lot.  The 6,000 gsm Chancery is comprised of a seven-story "tower" portion on Boulevard du Regent and a two-story back wing which abuts the CMR. The building forms a "U" shape around a paved interior courtyard and a full basement extends under the entire floor plate of the building including the tower, low wing and courtyard.  This level was originally constructed as a parking garage; evidence of the irregular column spacing and ramps still exist.  A sub-basement was built under the tower portion of the building, which is comprised of the building's mechanical services.

The entire building, with the exception of the top floor was constructed with cast-in-place concrete columns, beams, joists, floor and roof slabs.  The top floor of the tower is framed with structural steel, which is roofed with a concrete slab. The exterior walls of the Chancery are clad with flat (French) limestone panels set in a stacked pattern.  The original aluminum (double insulated glass) windows are set in punched openings.

Project Solicitation

THE PROJECT SOLICITATION WILL CONSIST OF TWO PHASES. This announcement for pre-qualification is Phase I. The Department of State will evaluate and rate the pre-qualification proposals based on the evaluation criteria set forth in the following Pass/Fail Evaluation Factors. Those offerors receiving a satisfactory evaluated rating from the technical board will be issued a formal solicitation (Request for Proposal) and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II. The government reserves the right not to pre-qualify any offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating in any evaluation factor or sub-factor. 

Prior Prequalification

	Prequalifications were done for the NEC projects in Johannesburg, Sarajevo, Harare,  Brazzaville, Libreville, Surabaya, Djibouti, Ouagadougou and Antananarivo and Beirut. Firms found prequalified for the specific individual projects listed in the previous sentence may prequalify for this project by submitting a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. Design build firms that submitted a prequalification package for SED design-build projects of similar scope and dollar value during FY 2005 and were successfully pre-qualified by the OBO technical panel need not resubmit a complete pre-qualification package under this announcement. If interested, the previously pre-qualified offerors must send the POC a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. 
	
         Letter of Interest:  The letter must be submitted in accordance with  the previous paragraph. However, if any changes have occurred in the construction firm's structure, size status, or team of the construction aspect of the offeror's original design-build pre-qualification package, the offeror must identify the change(s) in the letter fge(s) in the letter for the government to review and evaluate. The government will determine if such changes are acceptable.  Offerors must ensure that they cite the RFP number of the previous pre-qualification solicitation and what specific changes were made since pre-qualification. A change by the contractor must be sent for evaluation to this office regardless of how minor the offeror may believe it is. If no changes have occurred since pre-qualification, the offeror must state this in the letter of interest. Offerors are reminded that the letter of interest is due prior to the closure time and date of this solicitation otherwise the offeror will not be evaluated for pre-qualification for this project.

	Prequalification based on successful prior prequalification for the specific projects list above or based on prequalification in FY 2005 is subject to a satisfactory evaluation of Past and Present Performance as described in Factor 3 below.  Offerors need not provide additional Past Performance information.  The Government will determine the extent to which past performance will be evaluated and the internal and/or external sources from which past performance information will be sought, if any.

Prequalification Requirements

The submissions received in response to the Phase II formal solicitation shall be submitted in the formats provided and will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation procedures contained in the solicitation. Due to time constraints, it is anticipated that the pre-qualified firms will be required to participate in visits to the project sites within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the design-bid-build RFP. To offset some of the cost of the site visits and other related costs, pre-qualified firms that do not receive the design-bid-build award will be paid $10,000.00 for a fair and reasonable and responsive project proposal they submit in Phase II.

The government reserves the right not to pre-qualify any offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating in any evaluation factor or sub-factor. 

Prior Prequalification

	Prequalifications were done for the NEC projects in Johannesburg, Sarajevo, Harare,  Brazzaville, Libreville, Surabaya, Djibouti, Ouagadougou and Antananarivo and Beirut. Firms found prequalified for the specific individual projects listed in the previous sentence may prequalify for this project by submitting a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. Design build firms that submitted a prequalification package for SED design-build projects of similar scope and dollar value during FY 2005 and were successfully pre-qualified by the OBO technical panel need not resubmit a complete pre-qualification package under this announcement. If interested, the previously pre-qualified offerors must send the POC a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. 
	
         Letter of Interest:  The letter must be submitted in accordance with  the previous paragraph. However, if any changes have occurred in the construction firm's structure, size status, or team of the construction aspect of the offeror's original design-build pre-qualification package, the offeror must identify the change(s) in the or the government to review and evaluate. The government will determine if such changes are acceptable.  Offerors must ensure that they cite the RFP number of the previous pre-qualification solicitation and what specific changes were made since pre-qualification. A change by the contractor must be sent for evaluation to this office regardless of how minor the offeror may believe it is. If no changes have occurred since pre-qualification, the offeror must state this in the letter of interest. Offerors are reminded that the letter of interest is due prior to the closure time and date of this solicitation otherwise the offeror will not be evaluated for pre-qualification for this project.

	Prequalification based on successful prior prequalification for the specific projects list above or based on prequalification in FY 2005 is subject to a satisfactory evaluation of Past and Present Performance as described in Factor 3 below.  Offerors need not provide additional Past Performance information.  The Government will determine the extent to which past performance will be evaluated and the internal and/or external sources from which past performance information will be sought, if any.

Prequalification Requirements

The submissions received in response to the Phase II formal solicitation shall be submitted in the formats provided and will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation procedures contained in the solicitation. Due to time constraints, it is anticipated that the pre-qualified firms will be required to participate in visits to the project sites within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the design-bid-build RFP. To offset some of the cost of the site visits and other related costs, pre-qualified firms that do not receive the design-bid-build award will be paid $10,000.00 for a fair and reasonable and responsive project proposal they submit in Phase II.

Phase I

<CONTACT>JOSHUA M. BOWERS, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 513-487-2104, E-Mail: bowers.joshua@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. EPA hereby issues this Sources Sought synopsis in search of any vendor capable to complete a project entitled ?Development of a system for dry inoculation of building material coupons. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparation of any submission to this Sources Sought Notice or to a contract for services. This is a market survey for written information only, to ascertain whether the services contemplated for this procurement can be set aside for small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541710, the size standard of which is 500 employees. The U.S. EPA?s National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) is currently investigating various decontamination technologies for high value building materials contaminated with Bacillus anthracis.  Current on-going studies inoculate building material coupons using a syringe (liquid droplets).  However, the likely dissemination method for B. anthracis is aerosol dispersion, thus building materials will be contaminated by dry deposition.  Liquid inoculation may yield non-comparable decontamination efficacy results to actual event decontamination efforts for porous materials such as cinder block and wood.  A system for the dry inoculation of building material coupons is needed to ensure comparable efficacy results during decontamination efforts. In response to the need for reproducibly dosing building material coupons with dry B. anthracis, the U.S. EPA/NHSRC?s Decontamination and Consequence Management Division (DCMD) is seeking to develop an aerosol deposition system for use in the systematic decontamination studies.  The system shall be able to reproducibly (within 20%) dose coupons with user defined spore loadings in the range of 102 - 108 spores per coupon (7 cm2).  The terminal velocities of these spores shall mimic those expected in an anthrax release.   The system shall be applicable to all building materials of interest, specifically: painted and unpainted cinder block, stainless steel ductwork, industrial carpet, decorative laminate, ceiling tile, painted wallboard, and glass.  The system shall be able to dose at least twenty-five 20 mm x 35 mm coupons during a single deposition and the coupons shall be easy to remove, ensuring minimal disruption of the deposited particulate matter. As the B. anthracis innoculant is limited in availability, the deposition process must be efficient so as to conserve inocculant.  The deposition system shall be entirely contained to prevent environmental interference and contamination.  The system shall be both portable and autoclavable.   The performance of the aerosol deposition system shall be evaluated with a suitable surrogate for B. anthracis that is 1-3 ?m in diameter.  Uniformity of the aerosol deposition and reproducibility of coupon dosing shall be determined using Scanning Electron Microscopy or another comparable technology.  The ability for the system to deliver the needed concentrations of the spores to the building material coupons will be accessed here at the EPA and if the aerosol delivery system is unable to meet the specifications listed in the statement of work then the system shall be modified until it fulfills these requirements.   Interested parties shall submit capability statements that demonstrate their experience in this field. Capability statements shall not exceed 3 pages and standard company brochures will not be reviewed. Reference PR-CI-06-10372. Again, this statement is for information purposes only.  Interested parties shall submit their capability statement to the Contracting Officer via email at bowers.joshua@epa.gov no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Time, Friday, March 10, 2006.

<SUBJECT>HULS Industry Day
<DESC>All interested contractors are invited to attend an Industry Day with U.S. Navy Fleet and acquisition personnel involved in advancing the capabilities of unmanned underwater vehicles in ship hull search applications.  This event will be held on 29 March 2006 at the Navy Memorial in Washington, DC (701 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, DC 20004).  The yellow and green Metro lines serve the Navy Memorial. The objective is to provide an opportunity for early industry involvement in the Government's proposed approach for future low-risk, spiral procurement of the Hull Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Localization System (HULS) that will support the rapid search of ship hulls, pier walls, pilings, and other vertical, sloped, and horizontal underwater surfaces for limpet mines and other threat ordnance.  This system will be part of the “toolbox approach” for equipping Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) forces and, as such, must support expeditionary operations (i.e., two-man portable, easily deployable and maintainable).  The system will include a suitable suite of sensors to localize and identify objects of interest, pinpoint their location, and provide tactical information about those objects.  The system must be sufficiently robust such that its capabilities are not degraded by harbor noise and traffic.  It should be capable of being operated from a small inflatable craft commonly u!  sed by Navy EOD forces, as well as from other crafts of opportunity and from shore. The U.S. Navy has been exploring HULS employment concepts through several Office of Naval Research and PEO-LMW sponsored evaluations and demonstrations. These events have been crucial to gaining Fleet feedback and assisting in developing system requirements for the initiation of an acquisition program in FY06.  It is envisioned that during the initial phase of the acquisition program, more than one alternate design system will be procured for Requirements Compliance Test and Evaluation.  After an extended period of evaluation involving Navy laboratory and Fleet personnel, one of the alternate designs will be selected for further acquisition, provided at least one of the alternate designs is found to be operationally suitable and effective.  Input received from this Industry Day will facilitate refinement of the competitive acquisition strategy. Industry input is desired to allow for an effective acquisition program with well-defined requirements in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Attendance at the Industry Day is not a prerequisite for ultimately submitting any future proposals.  However, it will provide a valuable opportunity for questions & answers and industry input into the read-ahead documentation.  Any read ahead documentation will be posted for viewing on or about 17 March 2006.  Seating is limited.  Request a maximum of two (2) representatives per vendor.  Request attendees’ register for the Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop by providing Company/Organization Name, Name(s) of attendees, Company/Organization affiliation, address, telephone number, and e-mail address not later than 20 March 2006.  Registration data must be faxed or e mailed to the Technical POC identified below.  Any advance questions and/or comments pertaining to the Industry Day or the read-ahead documentation may be faxed or !  e-mailed to the Technical POC so that they can be addressed at Industry Day.  The purpose of this Industry Day is not to obtain proposals and is solely to offer early industry involvement in a contemplated U.S. Navy procurement.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information obtained during the workshop or for the time and expense of the industry participants involved, nor is the Government obligated to any future acquisition or procurement action.  For questions please contact the Technical POC: Patrick Whang (301) 744-6850 ext 286, FAX (301) 744-6947, e-mail: patrick.y.whang@ navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>99 -- NATO NC3A Conference and Seminar on Doing Business in the NATO C4ISR Environment
<DESC>Those U.S. firms with past experience with or potential interest in NATO and NC3A (NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency) are invited to attend the upcoming NC3A conference and seminar on doing business in the NATO C4ISR (Command, Control, Communication, Computer, Information, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) environment.

This conference will bring together NATO capability development and acquisition experts that span the life cycle from concepts and requirements to competitive bidding and implementation. Attendees can expect to hear about previous lessons learned in order to better position themselves for successful bidding. Additionally, the forum will address - in a symposium style - how NATO and industry can better form partnerships outside of the competitive environment. You will have a chance to widen your network of industry and NATO contacts, and you will learn first hand from firms that have been and continue to be successful in this highly competitive arena. 

At the conference, you can expect such topics as:

- What is the NC3A, what is its role, and why is it important to my business?
- How do NATO and the NC3A work together to acquire and implement C4ISR capability?
- What are the NC3A mechanics of Invitations for Bid and Source Selection?
- What are the major NATO C4ISR programs and associated industrial opportunities? 
- What have been critical success factors in past winning bids?
- How can the process be improved to bring Industry in earlier with less risk?

Each of these sessions will be complemented by top quality speakers - those in key NATO leadership positions to set the tone and then high-level experts in the fields of requirements, acquisition and capability development. 

The conference is scheduled to take place 27-28 November 2006 in Brussels, Belgium, with an extended ice-breaker and networking cocktail event the evening of Sunday 26 November. 

The conference will include a nominal participant fee to cover the costs of setup, administration and catering, but will be kept to a minimum to maximize participation. For planning purposes and to avoid limiting attendance, NC3A is trying to ascertain the number of participants interested in the conference. 

If your firm is interested in attending this conference, please email your company details, to include information on your primary point of contact, along with the approximate number of attendees, to Mr. Michael Cuoio, NC3A Executive Secretary, by 10 March 2006.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Enhanced Range Applications Program (EnRAP)
<DESC>This is not a notice for a solicitation. This is only a Request for Information (RFI). The government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this RFI. This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid but merely a request for information. The Air Combat Support Systems Group, Range Instrumentation System Squadron, is interested in obtaining price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes for the Enhanced Range Application Program (EnRAP). The EnRAP will provide a significant improvement to the Test and Evaluation (T&E) instrumentation of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.   Development will be accomplished under the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), with production under the same contract funded by the individual Services. 

EnRAP development will significantly improve the T&E range capabilities in the 5 major areas.  These areas are:  (1) Enhanced data transfer flexibility, (2) Increased TSPI accuracy and faster TSPI update rates, (3) Component miniaturization and modularity for better internal mounting flexibility, (4) Standardization of interface protocols and an open architecture design to support flexibility, and (5) Enhanced system encryption capability with new encryption technology all in accordance with performance capabilities documented in the EnRAP System Requirements Document (SRD).

The participant packages will allow for internal mounting in high dynamic vehicles, in instrumentation pods for external mounting on aircraft wing stations, and in an EnRAP Aircraft Instrumentation Subsystem Internal (EAISI) package for the F-18.  

Three levels of instrumentation will be provided.  Level I units will be low cost, lower accuracy systems for use on low-dynamic platforms.  Level II units will be moderate-cost units for use on high-dynamic platforms that don’t require extreme accuracy.  The Level III units will be for use on high-dynamic platforms that require the highest available accuracies.  Level III real time/post-mission position accuracy will be 0.3 meter/ 0.1 meter with real time/post mission velocity accuracies of 0.006 meters/second (m/s) and 0.002 m/s.

The EnRAP datalink transceiver will operate in the 1350-1450 megahertz (MHz) band.  The datalink throughput will support at a minimum 25 participants at 40 messages per second, using data messages that contain at least 1200 bits of usable information per message through one relay. Up to three relays (four hops) will be possible to extend range coverage.  The datalink transceiver will support air-to-ground communications to at least 130 nautical miles (nmi) and an air-to-air communications to at least 100 nmi. 

Maximum flexibility will be built into the system to change mission, participant, and message parameters during a mission and to customize message content.  Participant instrumentation will have the capability to interface to aircraft MIL-STD-1553 data buses. The EnRAP ground system design will incorporate a Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA)-compliant design.  All interfaces will be standardized and an open architecture will be incorporated to allow easy modification and upgrading of EnRAP components.

The datalink system uplink and downlink transmissions will be encrypted with the Next Generation Encryption Device (NGED). The NGED will be a state-of-the-art encryption device developed by the EnRAP contractor and will be designed to meet National Security Agency (NSA) standards for red and black separation up to the TOP SECRET level.  Participant packages will be designed to operate both with and without the NGED installed. 

Responses should be received by 31 March 2006. Point of contact for this Request for Information is Bruce Ringstad, technical, 850-883-3408, or Diane McKain, contractual, 850-883-3419. Email addresses are bruce.ringstad@eglin.af.mil or diane.mckain@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and FAR 13 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The solicitation number H92239-06-T-0020 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). 

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08.   It is the responsibility of the offeror to be familiar with all applicable clauses and provisions. Federal Acquisition Regulations and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplements (DFARS) provisions and clauses may be downloaded at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  

This procurement is 100% set aside for small business.  All responses from responsible small business sources will be fully considered.  The NAICS Code is 332710 and the size standard is 500 employees or less. This acquisition is to be a firm fixed price type contract.  The right to make multiple or no award(s) is reserved in the event it is advantageous to the Government to do so.

This action is to provide required equipment to US Army Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, NC as described below. 

The Government requires a mechanism that allows soldiers a mobile platform that can be attached to a M-1097 HMMWV that allows soldiers to scale 10ft high wall or gain entry into the second floor of a building.  This package must be removable to allow vehicles to be easily transportable by US Air Force aircraft.  All components should be able to fit in the cargo area of a standard HMMWV when disassembled.  The systems should consist of 4 main components:  main platform, main support system, upper and lower assault ladders and all necessary safety accessories and hardware.  The breakdown of this system should be based on removable pins and not on bolts that require additional tools.  Some hardware can be permanently attached to the vehicle as long as it does not hinder loading on an aircraft.  

The main platform should be constructed out of 6061-T6 aluminum structural grade.  Platform size should be approximately 90 inches by 90 inches.  Platform should be constructed of a highly traction able material that provides traction but does not injure personnel who fall or are sitting on the platform.  The main platform should be able to carry 2000 pounds with an adjustable system that changes that height of the platform.  The platform should have sufficient drainage to allow water to pass through and lesson over all weight of the platform.  All brackets, braces and pillow blocks supports should be CNC machined to a semi-close tolerance for rapid deployment and redeployment.  All mainframe hardware should be constructed from corrosion resistant materials such as stainless steel.  Four attaching points/hand holds should be placed to the upper edges of the platform to allow soldiers to tie into the top of the platform.  

All hardware used should be grade 8 bolts in a standard US measurement so they can be easily replaced if lost.  All push pins should be push button type with attaching lanyards.

The ladder should be dual hinged to allow it to scale the top of a wall and provide a means for the soldier to scale down the far side.  Ladder should be approximately 3 feet long from the platform attaching point to the first hinge and ten feet from the second hinge to the ground.  The ladder should be 3 feet wide to allow to soldiers to scale it at the same time.  The second set of hinges should be locking to allow the ladder to act as a 13 foot straight ladder.  This modification would allow the ladder to scale both sides of a 10 foot high wall or reach 13 feet above the platform level.  The ladder should be constructed out of the same aluminum as the assault platform.  

The ladder leading from the cargo area to the platform should be 3 feet wide and scale the space from the cargo area to the assault platform.  This ladder needs to be removable along with the rest of the system.  The ladder should be constructed out of the same aluminum as the assault platform.  

To aid in conceptualization, image files of a previously constructed platform (in .jpg format) are available upon request. Requests for site visits to view a previously designed product will be considered until 6 Mar 06.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation  PR-NC-06-10317 is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-07 effective  February 2, 2006.  This procurement is Full and Open Competition.  All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered. The NAICS Code is 541512 Computer Systems Design Services. This action is for support to provide interactive kiosks for the EPA lobby.   This requirement is Firm Fixed Priced including the following CLINS.  CLIN 0001-  Floor Standing Kiosks including keyboard (stainless steel) with17" Plasma Screen Qty- 2, CLIN 0002 - Floor Standing Kiosks including keyboard (stainless steel) with 60" Plasma Screen (Qty- 1) CLIN 0003- Kiosks Installation Service, CLIN 0004- On Site Maintenance Services, CLIN 0005 - Dell PCs (Qty - 4),OPTION CLIN 1001 - On Site Maintenance Services and OPTION CLIN 2001- On Site Maintenance Services.  Contractors are invited to provide their own CLIN structure incorporating all requirements. The requirements shall include the following:  The EPA requires a turn-key, production kiosk solution that is configured, installed and maintained by a kiosk hardware and software vendor.  A kiosk software product, which requires no expertise in Java, C++, or any other programming language is required.  The EPA requires a flexible, robust kiosk solution which can deliver general information, video clips, DVD presentations, database lookups, surveys, Power Point presentations, video-conferencing and TV satellite signals via both end user launch sequences as well as system scheduled launch sequences.   Upon installation, the touch buttons as shown in the attachment kiosk.ppt will bring up:  the EPA intranet page, CNN video feed, a DVD Presentation, a Power Point presentation.  The system needs to be able to have a PC technician - who is not knowledgeable about software development - easily add additional buttons or remove existing buttons in real-time as required (e.g., add a button for Science Forum web page or IPTV Broadcast; remove CNN button). The Presentation button needs to bring up subcategories to display the multiple presentations available to run on the kiosk at any given period of time. This subcategory list will allow a customer to launch and view a presentation in real-time, then have the system return to the default page when complete.  The presentation button needs to be easily configurable by local PC support staff so that we can add, change, remove or edit display times of presentations when required (e.g., have presentations run once every 30 minutes instead of every 15 or have a presentation run only once a day at noon).  Kiosks automatically power down each evening at 5pm and power up at 7am each morning with no user intervention. The kiosk software will also be able to run an IDLE routine which will launch a pre-configured, scheduled function (e.g., CNN, DVDs, Power Point presentations, IPTV broadcast) then return to the default page when complete with no end user intervention.  This means that once a scheduled function(s) has run, the system will re-display the default page with no end user intervention. All buttons (top, bottom, left side, right side) shown in Kiosk.ppt must be customizable to show different content.  No programming languages need to be known by the individual who add/removes buttons, or who manages and changes kiosk content.  The CNN Broadcast will be shown in the Content Presentation Area, it will NOT be shown full screen.  The kiosk software must support ATI Radeon video cards for displaying the CNN broadcast.  When displaying the EPA intranet, we need the navigation and status bars to appear.  The touch screen layout must be configurable so that we can easily switch the default page from Option 1 to Option 2 as shown in kiosk.ppt. Installation, documentation and training on how to use the kiosk software to manage content and buttons are to be included.  The kiosk software configuration will be set up on 4 production and 2 test systems (EPA has 2 kiosk PCs currently installed which will run the kiosk software requested by this solicitation).  The hardware configuration of the 2 kiosk PCs installed at EPA is:  Window XP SP2, 40 GB   IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers, GX270, Pentium 4 CPU 2.4 GHZ, 512 MB od RAM, Ati Radeon 8500 all in wonder video card. This will require 6 copies of the kiosk software.  Next day support for hardware repairs and software problems must be provided.  A 1-800 technical support line for kiosk questions and problems on both hardware and software must be provided.  Hardware and software support will be required beyond the first 12 months. EPA will provide the content behind the customizable buttons.  The kiosk software developer must provide the capability to easily customize buttons and the ability to add/remove buttons as needed.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND
The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

INTRODUCTION
OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS specialist will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES
The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.

<DESC>A00002 - Solicitation HSCG38-06-Q-100016 is hereby admended as follows: For clarification and answers to the solicitation.

1.	Date Discrepancy

The solicitation reads:
 
8.1	The contractor shall provide a detailed work scope, delivery schedule and  
       firm fixed price for painting the aircraft.  The aircraft shall be painted and 
       ready for USCG inspection within 14 days from aircraft induction at the 
       contractor’s facility.

Paragraph after 10.0 -Delivery and acceptance of services will be made by United States Coast Guard personnel.  Desired Delivery for CLIN 0001 is 16 days after receipt of aircraft at the paint facility and Required Delivery is 20 days after receipt of aircraft at the paint facility.

Clarification:

The dates are correct.  We want the aircraft painted in 14 days and ready for inspection.  The 16 days is if the USCG delivers early and the aircraft is not indoctrinated immediately.  The 20 days is the latest date of delivery (if any unforseen problems occur to the aircraft-ONLY).

2.	Define Days

Clarificaton:
            Days (as per the Federal Acquisition Register - FAR) is always calendar days                         
            unless otherwise specified (i.e. business days).
    3.  Define Minor Maintenance
         3.3.1 Minor Maintenance: The contractor will perform minor maintenance as  
       required.  This maintenance is limited to removal of exterior panels as required for 
       the purpose of cleaning any residual fluids that may leech from panel cavities.  
       Panels shall be reinstalled IAW the 1U-25A-3 (Structural Repair Manual).  Hardware 
       replacement (e.g. screws, washers, etc) if required shall be of correct type and length 
       IAW 1U-25A-4 (Illustrated Parts Catalog).  The CG liaison will provide maintenance 
       direction.
         Clarification:
         A fuel leak or major hydraulic leak is not normal and is not considered minor maintenance.       
         (Follow procedures in 3.3.3 Major Maintenance)

        Residual hydraulic fluid removal if required is an example of minor maintenance. USCG 
        will try to remove any residual fluids that have accumulated from other maintenance.   
        Sometimes this happens in the lower aft portion of the fuselage.  Normally the USCG has  
        not experienced any problems.

4.   Additional Responsibiltiy

      Can the contractor perform the duties of the USCG as per the following paragragh:

      The Coast Guard will:

3.2.3	Remove the spring fillets, elevator bearing boxes, air deflector and FLIR turret blanking plates upon delivery of the aircraft to the contractor’s facility and will re-install the same upon completion of aircraft painting.  
 
     Clarification:

      The stabilizers can be damaged if the spring fillets are improperly removed.  This  
      work shouldn't take over 2 hours.  If your company has experience in removing  
      these items then you can figure it in the quote.  It is recommended that the quote 
      reflect both options.  The cost if your company performs the work and the cost if the 
     USCG does the work.

5.  Dimensions of Aircraft

     Span: 53 ft 6 in (16.316 m)
     Maximum length: 56 ft 4 in (17.17 m)
     HU-25C
     Maximum length: 57 ft 6 in (17.53 m)

     Maximum takeoff weight: 32,000 lb (14,515 kg)

6. Does the aircraft have winglets? 

    No

7. Special Security Requirements?

    None - Aircraft can be locked.

8. Do wheel wells and trailing edge of slats get painted?

   No.  They were done at interim and we only touch up the wheel well areas due to the  
   plumbing, wiring and actuators.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-06-K-625582 for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 721110.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>Purpose of this modification to the solicitation is to provide the following information: 1. Can you tell us what the total collections were the last few years? $500,000 was collected in about 4 ½ years. 2. Does this include inpatient and outpatient services? This was for the purchase of medical supplies. No distinction was made between inpatient/outpatient. 3. Does the contractor have to provide this support on Post or can it be performed from the Contractor's site? Off site specified and non-intrusive. That means at the Contractors site. 4. Is the scope of the service to determine what is owed MEDCOM by certain suppliers and then proceed to collect what is owned or is MEDCOM going to provide a detail list of suppliers with past due debt that must be collected? No knowledge of what is owed.  Each medical treatment facility procures on their own. This office does not have corporate visibility of those contracts and purchases. This office will provide a list of every company (approximately 1500) that we know MEDCOM has done business with in the  last few years. The company that gets the contract will need to contact them and determine what is owed by reviewing their accounts payable and then collect the legitimate amounts owed to the MEDCOM. Companies should contact other medical companies that m ay not be on our list. While our list is thorough, we expect some companies to be inadvertently overlooked. The word Audit probably means very specific things in the finance world. We are asking the winning contractor to work with the companies and determi ne if there is a legitimate open accounts payable to the MEDCOM and then collect it on our behalf.  5. Does the scope require the selected contractor to perform audit work to determine what is owed MEDCOM? If the scope requires audit work to be done, will you provide a detail synopsis of the required audit procedures and experience?  See answer to #4 6. Item 4.2 states Request submission of appropriate accounting records that will be examined and analyzed by the contractor. The contractor will examine and analyze these accounting records to determine what? Are you asking for an audit of the records? Se e answer to #4. 7. In order for us to adequately determine pricing we need the following information: How old is the debt? Number of Accounts/Supplier? Age of debt is unknown. In the previous contract some collections were as old as 6-8 years.  However 90% were 3 years or  less. Also, see answer to #4. 8. Description of Debt?  Money owed to the MEDCOM by a company but not paid. Reason for debt is numerous: tax refund, damaged products, met competitors' price, return products, volume discount, over billings, etc.. 9. Will MEDCOM provide a supplier listing to the contractor? What is included in the listing? See answer #4. Will provide company name, address, phone zip, POCs when they are known. List is about 3 years old so I am sure there have been company mergers an d the POCs have changed.  10. Can we get a more detail description of Medical/Non-Medical items?  Medical supplies are pharmaceuticals, consumable and durable medical products and medical equipment used in a medical treatment facilities. What is meant by Non-Medical items is things like office supplies, furniture, computers, cleaning supplies, badges , etc. that are needed to make a facility operate but are not directly related to the care of a patient. 11. I assume that the value of the contract is more than the $50,000 shown for each year of the contract. I understand this is a place holder for the system? $50,000 is only an estimate per year amount. If more is recovered, then we will increase the amoun t.  12. It is stated that the contractor shall provide a list of MEDCOM Activities to perform this SOW for. Do you have an initial idea of what regions or MTFs are scheduled for the first year? I will provide the contractor a list of every MTF/clinic that I kn ow of at the start of the contract. 13. Is MEDCOM w iling to consider a hybrid pricing program where some base costs are covered, the remainder of the fees can be invoiced under a contingency plan? No. 14. How many different debtor referral accounts are expected to be referred per year? Will not provide any debtor accounts. Will provide the contractor a list of every company that I know we did business with in the past few years. It will be up to the con tractor to contact these companies to determine if there is a legitimate accounts payable to the MEDCOM.  15. What is the projected $ to be referred per year? See question #14. We have averaged $100K of collections each year.  16. What is the amount of spending on goods and services that would be audited under this contract? The MEDCOM spends between $400M and $500M on pharmaceuticals and MEDSURG items each year.   17. What is the total per year estimated value of the contract? We have averaged collecting $100K per year for the last 5 years.  18. Does this include the recovery of aged TPC (Third Party Collection) aged receivables? No.  19. What is total transaction volume under review? The MEDCOM does between $400K - $500K of pharmaceutical and MEDSURG business a year. The amount of credits to be recovered is unknown.  20. Is all data in a single database? If not, how many? There is no data base per se. Multiple individuals at each MTF order fairly independently of each other.   There is no central MEDCOM database of this data. It is up to the winning contractor to conta ct each of the manufactures and determine if there is an account payable to the MEDCOM.  21. How will lists of vendors be supplied to contractor? Email List is one EXCEL spread sheet of about 1500 companies.  It has company names, addresses, zip codes and POC's (if I know them).
