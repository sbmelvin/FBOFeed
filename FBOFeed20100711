In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non productive agency downtime. Please send expressions of interest to: Almeta A. Dixon, 935 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Room 10254, Washington, DC 20535 or by facsimile at (202)324-0570.

Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any; (4) Date of space availability; (5) Method of rentable space measurement; (6) Building Ownership Information, (7) Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any); (8) Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building; and (9) List of building services provided.) The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.
