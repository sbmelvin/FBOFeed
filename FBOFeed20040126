<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New York officials, requires four (3) firm-fixed price requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Manhattan, Brooklyn, West Queens, East Queens and Long Island areas of the State of New York.  During the spring of 2004, APHIS anticipates applying control treatments to approximately 113,000 host trees with an estimated 1,400,000 diameter at breast height (dbh)via trunk injection, estimated 23,000 host trees with an estimated 292,000 dbh via soil injection and 1,300 host trees with an estimated 5,200 dbh via soil drench total in all contract areas.  Control treatment applications are intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza and London Plane.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture had declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  Requirements contracts will be awarded to ensure contractual coverage is in place in the event additional control treatment applications are required or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, or date of award, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period of each contract awarded.  The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about January 30, 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer 3 weeks thereafter.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average annual receipts.  Telephone requests for a copy of the RFP will not be honored.

<DESC>Subcontract for Safe Storage Enclosure (SSE) Roof Construction – 105-H Reactor

(Note: This Subcontract will be set aside for award to Small Business firms only.)

The construction of the roof over the SSE (with a design life of up to 75 years) will occur during the final stages of the project to construct the SSE.  Most radiological contamination will have been fixed or removed in underlying areas where the roof is to be constructed.  A new roof will be designed and constructed over the SSE that will conceptually consist of structural steel columns, beams, girts and purlins with pre-formed standing seam steel roofing.   Open areas between the roof and the top of the reactor shield wall (gable ends and eaves) will be closed with similar sheet steel roofing material.  The roof structure will be anchored to the top of the reactor shield walls.  All remaining SSE penetrations will be sealed.  The final SSE roof structure design and calculations will be part of the subcontract for engineering, design, and construction of the SSE. 

The SSE facility power and lighting will be supplied by a contractor designed and subcontractor procured and installed, reduced capacity permanent power system that will provide power for the interim safe storage (ISS) period  (75 years).  The power system will consist of a transformer providing 120/240 V to lighting panels and outlets to power remote monitoring instruments and lighting to support surveillance and maintenance activities.

Ventilation and remote monitoring systems design and installation will be part of the subcontract work to support the ISS period.

The 105-H Reactor SSE will be similar to the other Hanford Reactor SSEs, that have been previously built or being built on the Hanford site.  Conceptual drawings will be provided with the request for proposal.  All other SSEs are ridged built.

The estimated subcontract value is between $ 2,000,000.00 and $3,000,000.00  million.  The subcontract performance period (award through design and completion of SSE Roof Construction) will be approximately 18 months.  The 105-H Reactor SSE request for proposal is scheduled to be out Febuary 2004 and award in April 04.

Prequalification is required.  Please go to http://www.bhi-erc.com/Opportunities/DoingBus/90-day.htm to download the pre-qualification questionnaire.  For additional information, contact Mr. Erik Lau, Subcontract Specialist, elau@bhi-erc.com

<CONTACT>Stephanie Utter Land Resources Manager 5097540261     sutter@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Columbia Area Office, Ephrata Field Office, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Okanogan Irrigation District (OID) to assist the Ephrata Field Office, by providing technical and other services, in the administration of cabin site leases at Conconully Lake and Conconully Reservoir in Conconully Washington.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b).  Reclamation, OID, and the State of Washington entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) dated February 29, 1952, governing the administrations of the recreational resources and facilities within the vicinity of Conconully Reservoir and Lake for a period of 50 years.  It was later amended to allow OID to issue summer home site leases, under general plans to be approved by Reclamation.  OID leased 83 cabin sites and 4 commercial sites located along the shoreline of Conconully Lake and Conconully Reservoir.  This agreement expired on February 28, 2002.  Upon expiration Reclamation was directed to administer the leases directly.   OID is only entity that would have the required background information on administration of the cabin site leasing at Conconully.  They have provided oversight of the cabin leasing program at Conconully, since 1952.  The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs.  Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, insufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  All responses received by close of business January 30, 2004, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Goverment not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Goverment.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5611, Attn. Becky Neuman, or by electronic mail at bneuman@pn.usbr.gov.

A) Background 

Nigeria is USAID’s largest development assistance program in sub-Saharan Africa.  USAID/Nigeria new five-year Country Strategic Plan (CSP) was recently approved by Washington for $400 million.  This CSP follows on the heels of the previous Transition Strategy, which began in September 1999, and was the direct result of USG re-engagement with Nigeria after 6-years of increasingly strained relations with the military dictatorship government.  USAID's Transition Strategy, developed by a team of USG agency representatives, laid a foundation for democratic governance and economic and social transition.  While this approach has been successful in re-engaging the Government of Nigeria, private sector and civil society, the efforts of the new CSP are redirected towards achieving significant results and promoting sustainable development.  The new CSP will be the first long-term strategy that USAID has implemented for Nigeria in twenty years.
 
The new strategy offers a comprehensive program of assistance to Nigeria to help further its democratic transition and address the social welfare needs and improve the economic conditions of Nigerians.  Within USAID/Nigeria, the Office of Program and Project Development has the lead for managing the implementation of the CSP.  Hence, it houses the Program Office’s resident experts on the project development, economic and social analyses for economic growth, democracy and governance, and social sectors, along with performance management, evaluations and portfolio reviews and results reporting.

Consultations involve assessment of program or policy impact, phenomena, or anomalies.  The incumbent is expected to provide support in the Mission for policy direction, planning, and performance assessment related to development and implementation of the Mission’s new CSP and to U.S. foreign policy issues as they related to development assistance.

<DESC>As part of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Nanoscale Science Research Centers Program, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) plans to construct the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).  The mission of the CNM is to advance the science of nanoscale materials by supporting world-class interdisciplinary and collaborative research in a user-facility environment.  

The CNM will be an approximately 87,000 gross square feet (GSF), two-story facility housing cleanrooms, laboratories, offices, and conference/assembly areas.  The CNM will be attached to the existing Advanced Photon Source ring building at ANL.  

The CNM cleanroom space is of fundamental importance to the mission of the facility.  The CNM will have approximately 11,000 GSF of ISO Class 5 and ISO Class 6 cleanrooms in a bay-and-chase configuration.  To support planned semiconductor fabrication-type research and development activities, which will involve the use of hazardous production materials (HPM), the cleanrooms are designed as an International Building Code, High-Hazard, Group H-5 occupancy.  The other areas of the building include: 

•	~13,000 GSF of research laboratories, 
•	~33,000 GSF of offices, conference rooms, and assembly areas.   
•	~30,000 GSF of facility and operations support spaces, including a mezzanine above the cleanrooms and laboratories for MEP support.  

A number of the CNM spaces will house very sensitive equipment that require the most stringent criteria for controlling such factors as vibration and electro-magnetic interference.  The construction of the CNM must support these criteria.  

Safety is of paramount importance in the construction and operation of the CNM.  The CNM project team is dedicated to a construction safety goal of zero lost workday cases.  Safe work practices will be integrated into all aspects of the construction process.  

Due to the highly specialized, technical nature of the facility, and the fact that proper construction phase implementation of all criteria is fundamental to the mission of the facility, ANL will implement a prequalification process to ensure invited general contractors have the requisite capabilities and experience, as determined by ANL.  A key focus of ANL’s evaluation will be a contractor’s track record of successfully completing projects similar to the CNM, as described above.  

Jacobs Facilities, Inc. (Jacobs) is under contract as Construction Manager supporting the CNM project.  Jacobs will implement the prequalification process with ANL, and will support the procurement and construction phases.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, Information Directorate (AFRL/IF) is soliciting proposals for a sixty (60) month effort to conduct Web-enabled Timeline Analysis System (WebTAS) software development and system support for various military commands and Government agencies. This effort supports the Air Force in providing Department of Defense (DoD) commands, state, and federal agencies with a software toolkit that provides a general data visualization and analysis infrastructure for the analysis of temporal, spatial, entity, and association information.  The flexible WebTAS architecture exploits multiple data sources and provides data mining tools that facilitate trend and pattern analysis to support activity prediction.  This effort will perform engineering and technical tasks and operations and maintenance support for current and new users of the WebTAS software toolset.  Technical enhancements are needed to correct any identified shortcomings in the toolset and to provide additional capabilities, features, processes, and documentation.  The enhancements will extend WebTAS functions and provide more effective and efficient capabilities to meet the needs of the users.  Installation support will be needed to install the WebTAS software and train users at multiple sites throughout the world.  Operations and maintenance actions will be needed to provide continued system support to current customer sites and to the new sites after system installation.  In the course of performance, the support personnel will interface with various DoD and Government agencies through visits and electronic means, and technical visits that will take place at various sites, worldwide.  The support personnel will also provide technical support to AFRL/IFE to assist in the analysis, design, development, integration, testing, and evaluation.  Anticipated deliverables include software and technical documentation.  An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months.  The WebTAS web site:  www.webtas.com will serve as the technical read library relating to the subject area of this acquisition and is available for review by any potential offerors.  Access to the users manual and an evaluation request require approval by the Government WebTAS Program Manager.  Therefore, prospective offerors must provide a completed and approved DD Form 2345 which certifies the offeror is on the Certified Contractors Access List (CCAL) or the offeror is seeking application to CCAL.  Prior to access being granted, respondents must submit a copy of an approved DD Form 2345, Contractor Access List (CCAL), along with a letter from the Data Custodian designated on that form, authorizing access by whomever will be reviewing the users manual and evaluation request, to the WebTAS Program Manager at the Air Force Research Laboratory/IFEA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, New York 13441-4514, or faxed to his attention at 315-330-4380.  For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Information Service at 1-800-352-3572 or on the web at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/.

<DESC>A sole source procurement in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 is contemplated with Dynetics, Inc., Huntsville, AL. (See Numbered Note 22) to upgrade the Irma RF scene generation tool.  This effort includes simulating a radar consisting of multiple antennas using the Irma active millimeter-wave (AMMW) channel, such that the Irma output for a given frequency models the target scene with individual scattering sources that can be used to form, for each antenna, a coherent sum of the returns from all the scattering sources.  All of these effects must be accurately modeled to achieve the required fidelity for an RF sensor and target scene simulation that more accurately represents how a munitions proximity fuze radar functions in real world weapon-target engagement conditions.  This effort will require an in-depth knowledge of the existing Irma AMMW source code and the particular physical optics models used to develop the Irma AMMW code.  The Government has determined that this expertise currently exists with the original Irma AMMW model developers, currently employed by Dynetics, Inc.    The total effort is not expected to exceed 4 months.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, or submit proposa1s.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received within forty-five days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Responses submitted should be in one copy only and must be received within 45 days from the date of publication. Responses should be sent to AFRL/MNK, 101 W.

<CONTACT>Richard P.  Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity GovWorks, will manage the following procurement action on behalf of the US Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency (RMA). GovWorks intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about February 10, 2004 utilizing a Statement of Objectives (SOO) that will describe the basic, top-level objectives for developing a risk management program for pasture/rangeland and forage.  This approach will provide potential offerors the flexibility to develop cost effective and innovative solutions that meet RMA's goals and objectives for the program.  RMA's goal is to obtain proposals which: (1) provide improvements to existing crop insurance programs specific to pasture, rangeland and forage; and/or (2) research and development of new, and potentially innovative crop insurance programs for pasture/rangeland, forage and hay that is used for cattle. RMA has had limited experience and success in developing insurance products for the wide array of forages and hay that are used by livestock. Typically, livestock producers do not keep adequate production records required for APH-type insurance products. RMA wants to identify and target these markets to pursue development of viable risk management products.  Currently, RMA provides coverage for rangeland under the Group Risk Plan (GRP) Rangeland Crop Insurance Pilot program in a limited number of Montana Counties. There is also an APH Forage program for alfalfa hay. RMA is considering the development of a new pilot Pasture and Rangeland crop insurance program based on the use of a plant growth model. RMA is aware that many producers of forage crops are not able to insure these crops under the existing (APH) Forage Production or GRP Forage Production Crop Insurance Programs. Therefore, RMA is seeking improvements to existing crop insurance programs and development of new and innovative approaches for providing improved forage coverage and risk management protection. Offerors may submit multiple proposals, offering different solutions, and more than one contract may be awarded. More program details and proposal requirements will be provided in the pending RFP, including details on a planned Bidders' Conference to be hosted by RMA in Kansas City, MO in early March.

GENERAL INFORMATION:
Subject to the availability of funds, Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) in Albuquerque, New Mexico (located on Kirtland Air Force Base with restricted gate access) intends to contract for the construction of the third element of the Microsystems and Engineering Sciences Applications (MESA) complex, including construction, installation of equipment, system integration, documentation and commissioning.  The construction estimate for this element of the MESA Project is approximately $39M.  The purpose of this announcement is to invite interested firms to attend a pre-proposal meeting to be held on Wednesday, March 17, 2004, in the afternoon (1:00PM to 3:30PM) in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  This will be the only pre-proposal conference held.


This element of the MESA complex, the Weapons Integration Facility (WIF), consists of the following: 1) a new, ~160,000 gsf facility construction, 2) associated site improvements and 3) ~2900 gsf addition to a central utility building (CUB-2).

Offeror must have a proven record of successfully completing projects of comparable size, complexity and function.  Offeror must also have demonstrated knowledge and construction experience in the Technical Capabilities listed below.

WIF PROJECT TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES:
The Weapons Integration Facility (WIF) is a high-security facility providing classified and unclassified workspaces for 374 personnel.   It is comprised of two building elements totaling approximately 160,000 gross square feet (gsf).  Antiterrorism construction standard features are incorporated into the facility design and the site improvements, which consist of support structure enhancements, blast resistant glazing, establishment of perimeter vehicle/pedestrian barriers at an appropriate stand-off distance, automated access controls for vehicles and pedestrians, security fencing, and parking. The WIF will be constructed adjacent to existing operational facilities located in the southeast corner of SNL’s Technical Area I.  

The classified WIF (WIF-C), consists of a three story building with a partial basement and mechanical support equipment penthouses.  The structure is concrete waffle slab construction that is designed to a vibration criterion of 1,000 micro-inches/sec and includes structural anti-collapse features.  The WIF-C will contain laser labs, electrical labs, advanced visualization technical design development areas, and office workspace for research and support staff.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to cancel the presolicitation notice for DTCG83-04-Q-3WF097.  Because of an increase in the Government's estimated cost to perform the project, the solicitation will not be issued under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation will be issued as an Invitation for Bid (IFB); subject to Sealed Bidding procedures.  The solicitation number will be changed to DTCG83-04-B-3WF097.  In addition to the solicitation being changed from and RFQ to and IFB, the solicitation will be changed from a Total Small Business Set-Aside to a Total HUB-Zone Set-Aside.  The Government reasonably anticipates that 2 or more certified HUB-Zone concerns will be interested in bidding on this project.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide answers to vendor questions as follows: QUESTION: 1) Cost:  We are assuming request for cost is preliminary and broad in nature.  ANSWER: Yes.  The information contained within the RFI does not provide adequate detail to determine costs for licensing, infrastructure, hardware, deployment, etc.  For the purposes of the RFI, we intend to identify a cost range for estimating purposes.  Please let us know if this meets the RFI requirements.  ANSWER: A cost range will be acceptable.  Storage requirements for each of the four high demand sites would be in the 1-2-pedabyte region.  Installation of the entire system would be required at all 4 high demand areas.  Windows OS preferred, but not mandatory.  Multi-level security access will need to be resolved to allow access to data on a need to know basis.  Security levels involved: unclassi fied, confidential, secret, secret-SCIF.  QUESTION:  2) Document Management System:  Other than 5015.2 compliance, is there a preference in place for a document management system?  Is there a current system in place that could be expanded to support the scope of the project?  ANSWER: No preferred document management system.  There may be other DOD facilities with a Document Management System in place or in development and could be expanded or adopted. QUESTION:  3) Hosting: Is it the intent to have the document management system hosted at one single site or are all four high demand sites planning on hosting individual systems?  ANSWER: The four high demand sites would host data under their control with access to that data available to other users on a need to know basis. QUESTION: 4)  Schedule:  The RFI refers to a request for a schedule (“FY 2006 - Provide a schedule  and/or comments regarding the schedule objectives”).  Is a high-level MS Project document acceptable to support this request?  ANSWER: Yes. QUESTION: 5) Since  we focus on Storage management and only a part of the RFP is asking for this requirement, do we hand in the specifications and pricings to that part on its own or do we have to partner with the company that will be awarded the complete contract?  ANSWER: For purposes of the RFI, submittals on portions of the information are acceptable.  However, if this requirement is solicited in the future, it is anticipated to be a single contract awarded to one company.  That company would need to partner or subcontract with other companies to provide the complete package of hardware and software.

<CONTACT>Janis Stanton, Contract Specialist, Phone 208-378-5710, Fax 208-378-5735, Email janis.stanton@id.usda.gov
<DESC>THE ORIGINAL NOTICE IS HEREBY CORRECTED TO REFLECT THE USE OF FOMRS SF-254 AND 255 INSTEAD OF SF-330, IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICE DATED JANUARY 7, 2004.  The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is seeking qualified A & E firms.  The NRCS, Idaho, proposes to contract for the final design of a pressurized pipeline irrigation water delivery system for the Little Wood River Irrigation District (LWRID).  The project is located in Carey, Blaine County, Idaho.  The final design shall include the preparation of construction drawings and specifications for the conversion of the LWRID’s open earthen canal/lateral ditch system to a pressurized pipeline system.  The LWRID supplies water to 10,800 acres of irrigated cropland and small pasture areas in and around Carey, Idaho.  The design will be completed in accordance with the general features for the project as outlined in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement prepared by NRCS for the Little Wood River Irrigation District Gravity Pressurized Delivery System.  The NRCS preliminary design evaluations for the EIS indicate that the required peak design flow for the pipeline distribution system is 180 cfs.  The proposed distribution system consists of two pipelines that begin at the existing diversion in the Little Wood River and follow the general route of the open canal/lateral ditch system.  The pipeline irrigation system will deliver water to individual on-farm irrigation systems.  The proposed distribution system will require approximately 40 miles of pipeline (combination main trunk line and spur lines).  The upper end of the system will require booster pumps to pressurize the on-farm sprinkler irrigation systems.  The contract will be a firm, fixed-price Architect-Engineer (A&E) contract.  The contract will require services including: confirming location for all individual on-farm points of water delivery; finalizing pipeline layout route(s), final design of pipeline and appurtenances, including booster pumps on upper end of the system, outlet assemblies to the individual on-farm systems and  final design of the inlet/screening structure; preparation of final construction drawings and specifications, a design report, cost estimate, bid schedule, operation and maintenance plan; and consultative services during construction.  The selected firm will be required to perform the design activities in accordance with Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) standards and certify that the design meets applicable NRCS criteria.  All drawings will be computer generated in *.dwg format.  Well documented electronic copies and original hard copies are to be furnished to NRCS.  The estimated cost for the construction of the pressurized pipeline system is 20 to 30 million dollars.  
Selection of the A&E firm will be based on the following criteria, shown in descending order of importance: a. Specialized experience and knowledge in the design of pressurized irrigation water distribution systems; b. Knowledge of NRCS policy, criteria and procedures; c. Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the work; d. Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time frame; e. Past performance on contracts with the Federal government and private industry; and f.  Location in general geographical area of the project and demonstrated knowledge of the locality of the project.  The above evaluation factors will be weighted as follows:  (a) 30%, (b) 15%, (c) 20%, (d) 15%, (e) 10%, and (f) 10%.

This solicitation will not be restricted to any group or business size pursuant to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program. NAICS Code: is 541330, Engineering Services.  The size standard for this NAICS code is $4,000,000.
 
Firms interested in providing these services and which meet the requirements described in this announcement are to submit 4 copies of Standard Form 254 and 255.  Interested firms must submit their SF-254s and SF-255s not later than 3:00 p.m. on March 1, 2004, to the attention of the Contracting Officer, 9173 W. Barnes Drive, Suite C, Boise, Idaho  83709.  Only those firms responding by that time will be considered for selection.  If the offeror plans to use a subcontractor, separate SF-254s and SF-255s must be submitted for the subcontractors.  A minimum of three of the most highly qualified firms will be selected for discussions and will be ranked by the A&E Evaluation Board for negotiations.  The most qualified firm will be asked to provide a cost proposal. All questions must be directed to the contracting officer in writing by e-mail at Janis.Stanton@id.usda.gov, by facsimile to 208-378-5735, or by letter to Janis Stanton, Contracting Officer, USDA-NRCS, 9173 W.

<CONTACT>Alice Sanders, Contract Specialist, Phone 210-536-3853, Fax 210-536-5836, Email alice.sanders@brooks.af.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): The Deployable Oxygen System (DOS) IPT at the Human Systems Program Office, Brooks City Base, TX is in the process of seeking information from industry regarding development of a new family of gaseous oxygen generation systems to compliment the existing commercially available Deployable Oxygen System (DOS). The systems will be additions to the current DOS program.  This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. 

BACKGROUND: The family of gaseous oxygen generation systems being considered for development would include a small (6-15 LPM), medium (60-180 LPM), and large (180-300 LPM) system.  There are two key performance parameters (KPPs) that these systems must meet.  The systems must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medical device and the oxygen purity generated by the systems must be no less than 93 percent USP. These systems will be deployed to support an array of military operations throughout the world. The Air Force will initially focus efforts on the development of the medium sized (60-180 LPM) gaseous oxygen generation system. 

QUESTIONS TO INDUSTRY: A list of performance specifications, focus questions and a draft Statement of Objectives for the medium sized gaseous oxygen generation system are provided with this RFI.  Interested parties in the development of the medium sized oxygen generator must respond to focus questions via e-mail to both contacts listed below.  POCs listed below must receive your response/comments within fifteen (15) days of the publication of this announcement.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), or a large business. 

DoD CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR): Supplement (DFARS) have been amended to require contractor registration in the CCR database prior to the award of any contract, basic agreement, blanket ordering agreement or blanket purchasing agreement.  Having a CAGE Code alone is no longer sufficient to qualify a contractor to do business with DoD. (Parts 204, 212, and 252 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation.)  For CCR registration help or to find out the status of your registration call DLIS Customer Service 1-(888)-227-2423 or 269-961-4725 or go to the web site at www.ccr.gov.  Please have your DUNS number available if known.  Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) can be contacted at 1-866-705-5711.

Written responses should be addressed to 311 Human Systems Wing/YASK; ATTN: Ms. Alice Sanders, 7980 Lindbergh Landing, Brooks City-Base TX 78235-5119. For information please call Ms. Sanders (Buyer) at (210) 536-3853 or Ms. Jean Martinez (Contracting Officer) at (210) 536-4734, Correct FAX Number is (210) 536-4535, email address provided herein.  No collect calls.

 SOLICITATION NUMBER: RFP# 263-04-018 
 ISSUANCE DATE: January 26, 2004
 CLOSING DATE/TIME: 4:30 pm Cairo time on March 1, 2004
 POSITION TITLE: Supervisory Commodity Management Officer/Division Chief
 MARKET VALUE:  GS-15 
 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two years with an option to renew for two years
 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/Cairo, Egypt. 
 SECURITY ACCESS: SECRET
 AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
 
I.	Introduction: 
             
Organizational Location of the Position:  The position requires residence in Cairo, Egypt.  Cairo is the largest city in Africa and the Middle East.  It has a number of urban problems such as severe pollution, and traffic congestion.  However, it is relatively crime-free and offers many cultural and recreational opportunities, including major museums, important historical sites, and most sports.  The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are easily reachable and provide opportunities for most water sports, especially snorkeling and scuba diving.

USAID/Egypt Program:  USAID/Egypt manages the largest and one of the most diverse programs in USAID.  The program is highly visible and consequently attracts intense State Department interest, Embassy oversight, and Congressional scrutiny.  The Mission is currently restructuring its portfolio to accommodate a planned reduction in the program budget by one-half and the staff by two-thirds over the next seven years, and a new country strategy that is designed to support Egypt’s efforts to compete successfully in the global economy.

The incumbent will serve as the Chief of the Commodity Management Division in the Economic Growth Directorate.  The Commodity Management Division oversees the Private Sector Commodity Import Program, currently funded at $200 million per year, and scheduled to be reduced to $150 million over the next seven years.  
 

II.		Basic Functions


The incumbent serves as Director of the Division of Commodity Management, a component of the Economic Growth Office, the largest office in the Mission.  The Division of Commodity Management is the focal point within USAID/Egypt for all aspects of policy, administration, and operations of the Private Sector Commodity Import Program (PRCIP).  The PRCIP is statutorily maintained at the minimum level of $200 million annually, which corresponds to over 30% of the total program yearly obligations.  The thrust of the program is to support the private sector as Egypt’s primary engine of growth by expanding and deepening financial services, and by introducing new technologies.  In addition, the PRCIP supports mission objectives by means of special incentives for investment in Upper Egypt, and for exporting companies.  Through special promotions, the Division seeks to direct PRCIP funds into fields associated with other Mission objectives, such as pollution abatement and medicine.  The incumbent manages a staff of one deputy and 19 FSNs.  Program partners include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Egypt, 31 participating Egyptian banks, and 10 U.S. correspondent banks.  Program customers are the private sector importers that use the program.  With great sensitivity regarding USAID and USG goals and interests, the position demands an ability to deal effectively with all partners, customers, and others within a complex environment in accomplishing the goals of the division.

A.  Position Title: USAID General Development Specialist – Thailand.

B. Organizational location of the position: USAID Regional Development Mission/Asia (RDM/A), Bangkok, Thailand.

C. Position Title of Direct Supervisor: General Development Officer, USAID Regional Development Mission, Bangkok, Thailand, or his/her designee. 

D. BACKGROUND 

The Regional Development Mission/Asia (RDM/A) based in Bangkok, Thailand is seeking a Personal Services Contractor (PSC) to work as a General Development Specialist in RDM/A’s Office of General Development (OGD).  Only United States citizens should apply.  Based on the Specialist’s skill mix, RDM/A will work with the Specialist to design a portfolio that falls within the OGD’s responsibilities.  The OGD oversees regional and country specific programs in mainland East Asia including Burma, China, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam in the areas of economic growth, governance, cross border and migrant populations, humanitarian assistance, trafficking in persons, and education.  These programs command a significant share of RDM/A’s development resources.  

The Specialist will be responsible for:  1) helping to devise appropriate strategies and plans for supporting the development of his/her portfolio; 2) contributing to the design, implementation, and management of cost effective programs that produce meaningful results; 3) helping to facilitate the proper coordination and integration of his/her portfolio into all RDM/A programs and the activities of other U.S. government agencies, international organizations, and bilateral donors; 4) providing policy advice and analyses to the Director of the Office of General Development and as appropriate to other senior Mission management on topics related to his/her portfolio; and 5) working collaboratively with members of the Office of General Development, Mission staff, the Department of State, other U.S. Government agencies, international, private sector, and non-governmental organizations, and foreign donors.

Development Challenges: The East Asia region faces major development challenges including corruption, weak or oppressive governance, the spread of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, large mobile cross-border populations, poorly regulated financial sectors, and persistent environmental degradation.  These challenges hinder the prospects for equitable economic growth and human well being. A lack of transparency in economic and legal institutions as well as severe restrictions on human freedoms in some countries demonstrate the region’s democratic weaknesses.  Extrajudicial killings, torture, forced labor, and other abuses occur throughout Burma and have contributed to growing numbers of Burmese refugees in neighboring countries.  Parts of the region harbor terrorists often linked to radical Islam who pose significant risks to the United States.

Any illusions that this region would ‘naturally’ be spared the HIV/AIDS endemic tragedy that Africa experiences are gradually being dispelled.  In the Asia and Pacific region, each day approximately 1,192 people die of AIDS and about 2,685 people become infected with HIV.  Population increases, rapid industrialization, and unsustainable energy policies are straining the region’s natural resources and environmental systems.  Urban air pollution levels are among the highest in the world:  it is estimated that China loses as much as 10 percent of its national income to pollution, while the nations of Southeast Asia lose 5 to 6 percent.  Rapid social and economic changes occurring in the region fuel mobile migrant populations and the growth of both the sex and drug trades. 

United States foreign policy priorities in mainland East Asia include supporting the war on terrorism, expanding trade and investment, stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS, and halting environmental degradation.  To support these priorities and address the major development challenges plaguing the region, the RDM/A works to:

•	Promote transparent and democratic institutions; 
•	Increase effective responses to HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases; 
•	Promote cleaner cities and industries in Asia; and
•	Help migrants and victims of trafficking in persons.

The Regional Development Mission/Asia:  The RDM/A manages regional and country-specific programs in mainland East Asia including Burma, China, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam.  The Mission also manages HIV/AIDS and environmental programs that extend east into the Pacific and west into South Asia.  RDM/A acts as the regional hub for services including contracting, administration, and disaster response.  RDM/A is in the process of developing new operational strategies based on a sectoral approach to guide its programs.  

RDM/A’s Office of General Development:  a) Regional Program:  The Office of General Development manages programs that work to improve regional economic governance and help migrants and victims of trafficking.  OGD will launch activities to improve public and private sector governance (for example, greater transparency and accountability, changed public policies and judicial reform), advance democratic processes, address terrorism (for example, anti-money laundering), and promote more open political systems.  Regional efforts will also attempt to address the challenges of re-establishing financial and political stability by improving the policy, legal, and regulatory environment.  This program is expected to work in Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and China and complement and support the US Government ASEAN Cooperation Plan.  

b)  Education in Southern Thailand and Northern Malaysia:  This prospective program would enhance Islamic education systems in Thailand and Malaysia in order to provide students with more and better post school options and allow them to compete with the students in the public school systems. These students who attend Islamic schools often have 50% of their time in Islamic studies and the other half in standard curriculum. This program will enhance the capacity of those schools systems and teachers to maximize the hours available to improve educational results. 

c) Burma Program:  RDM/A’s Office of General Development also manages humanitarian assistance programs for  Burmese living within and outside refugee camps in Thailand.  OGD funds educational scholarships for Burmese refugees and administers democracy activities that finance training for Burmese journalists and public information workers.

d) China Program:  The Office of General Development also supports programs that work to introduce key members of the Chinese legal and judicial system to the constitutional principles that support the rule of law such as due process, transparency, and equal access to justice.  In addition, OGD helps backstop USAID projects that provide Tibetan communities within China with access to financial, technical, marketing, environmental, and educational resources that can help them to improve their well-being.  

e) Laos Program:  RDM/A’s Office of General Development manages projects that addresses the critical needs of poor, vulnerable children in Laos and provide technical assistance to help generate income for rural farmers by improving the quality, quantity, and yield of silk yarn production.  The Leahy War Victims Fund, supported by OGD, also provides emergency care facilities, trains emergency care staff, and educates Laotian students about unexploded ordinance.

8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)  BACKGROUND

USAID/CAR Background:

Central Asia borders Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its location amidst these neighbors and its substantial oil and gas reserves, Central Asia is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.   With a total population of 55 million and dozens of ethnic groups, the five new nations of the region are emerging from isolation and almost two centuries of Russian domination.  A recent civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, authoritarian governments, and lack of viable institutions make Central Asia a particular challenge for USAID.  

USAID's Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible, in close consultation with the five U.S. Ambassadors in the region, for the design and management of USAID assistance programs in five republics.  The central office is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan with offices in Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  USAID/CAR is one of the Agency's largest Missions responsible for approximately $90 million of assistance annually, with activities totaling $400 million in the areas of energy and environment, economics and finance, democracy and media, and health and humanitarian assistance.  It works in partnership with over 70 grantee and contractor teams.  USAID/CAR's assistance seeks to expand opportunities for participation, livelihood and quality of life for the citizens of the Central Asian Republics.  Staff frequently travels to each of the five countries to manage and monitor assistance.  

Conflict Mitigation Program Background Information:

A.	USAID/CAR’s conflict prevention and community action programs build social stability in key regions of Central Asia by improving living conditions and economic opportunities through community action and organization.  The programs includes cooperative agreements with: Mercy Corps International for cross-border activities in the Ferghana Valley; Mercy Corps International for activities in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan; ACDI/VOCA for activities in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan; CHF for activities in southern Uzbekistan; Aga Khan Foundation for activities in Tajikistan; and UNDP for activities in Tajikistan.  Specific activities within these programs:

-	Rehabilitate and improve the social and public infrastructure of communities aimed at reducing conflict;
-	Provide loan and business development opportunities to micro and small enterprises; 
-	Facilitate dialogue in and among communities to address potential sources of conflict; and 
-	Build community organizational, self-governance, and advocacy capabilities

To ensure that USAID/CAR is meeting the needs of local communities, and to reinforce democratic processes, decisions regarding the selection of specific community development infrastructure projects such as schools, health clinics, domestic/potable community water delivery systems, and social service/community centers, involve the local community.  

Geographic Focus: The USAID/CAR Conflict Mitigation Program focuses on particular regions where the potential for conflict and extremism is greatest: the southern portions of Uzbekistan; the Ferghana Valley (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan (including Batken)); southern Kazakhstan; non-Ferghana Valley regions of Tajikistan; and the Lebap region of Turkmenistan.

The Ferghana Valley is a key geographic focus of USAID/CAR’s program that has activities in all three countries comprising the Valley.  USAID/CAR works in the Ferghana Valley with local non-governmental organizations, the independent media and legal reform, substantial health care reform, support to small businesses including, micro-lending, capacity building for economic and business faculties, and significant investment in water and irrigation management.  In 2002, USAID/CAR expanded its Ferghana Valley activities to include a conflict mitigation program that spans all three countries, as well as other regions in Central Asia.

Types and Scope of Activities Envisioned:

The Conflict Mitigation Program is designed to focus on the following activities/areas:

	Community Mobilization: This activity utilizes a regional approach to reduce resource-based conflict through community mobilization and enhances cross-border and multi-ethnic linkages over a three-year period, by empowering cross-border and multi-ethnic communities to identify and address sources of conflict through constructive dialogue and action planning.   The community action programs will focus on enhancing community infrastructure, living conditions, and economic opportunities through improved community dialogue and collective action.

To ensure that USAID investments are sustainable and meet the needs of local communities we are assisting, all infrastructure repairs or new construction are selected through a participatory process involving citizens and local government/ leadership of the community.  Introduction of participatory, democratic practices through this project will also bolster USAID’s objectives in building a democratic culture in Central Asia.

	Infrastructure:  To the maximum extent possible, USAID is building linkages with other sectors in which USAID is working to ensure maximum synergies between reform processes and improved infrastructure.  These include health, water, and other activities that strengthen and improve communities.  A secondary factor is the breadth of the impact, targeting those activities that will touch as many lives in the community as possible.  A final consideration is sustainability.  While it should not be the driving factor for selection, we are targeting those types of infrastructure projects that are most likely to be sustainable in the long term.

The print journal reaches nearly 10,000 subscribers for a total print readership of 35,000.  All other health policy journals have far lower print circulations in the 2,000-5,000 range.  In addition, online readership for Health Affairs in 2003 reached over 2.8 million page views in over 630,000 user sessions. Because of its focus and experience in presenting sophisticated discussion of health policy issues for a non-clinical audience, Health Affairs is the best mechanism for communicating with AHRQ’s intended policy audience. Interested parties should fax a written request to the Contracting Officer at 301-427-1740 no later than 5:00pm on February 10, 2004.  All responses will be considered by AHRQ.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

participation in the New England Air Quality Study from July 1, 2004 through August 15, 2004 in and around Portsmouth, New Hampshire. ETL will be deploying an airborne UV-DIAL ozone lidar in this study. The UV-DIAL ozone lidar is an instrument that is used to make measurements of ozone concentrations in the lower atmosphere. This instrument uses laser light pulses transmitted in a downward direction from an aircraft to determine the ozone concentration at points from just below the aircraft to points near the ground.  The aircraft provided shall be suitably equipped to accommodate the ozone lidar in the field study. The aircraft must be fully ready, with the instrument installed before the study start date of July 1, 2004 for coordination with many other researchers and instruments.  (a) The aircraft shall be able to accommodate the following:  (1) The cabin of the aircraft shall be of a size to allow the following equipment to fit with adequate room left for operator access to the instrument and clear egress. The system is composed of five units with dimensions of (w x l x h):  Laser and Optics Frame - 107 cm x 274 cm x 165 cm (42" x 108" x 65"), Power Distribution Unit - 71 cm x 71 cm x 76 cm (28" x 28" x 30"), Laser Gas Processor - 33 cm x 61 cm x 56 cm (13" x 24" x 22"), Data Acquisition Units 2 @ 102 cm x 69 cm x 114 cm (40" x 27" x 45").  (2) The aircraft shall have a clear opening larger than 56 cm wide x 66 cm long (22" x 26") in the underside of the aircraft located such that the system telescopes can be positioned over the opening and view in a nadir direction.

Additional space should be allowed for access to the instrument.  (3) The door to the cabin shall be sufficiently wide and tall and appropriately located to allow installation of the system in a level orientation. (4) Flights may be conducted at altitudes from 1000 m to 4000 m (3000 to 13000 feet) AGL. (5) Flight durations will be approximately 8 hours. There may be up to two flights conducted in a single day and may include nighttime flights.  (6) The total weight of the instrument package and operators will be approximately 1000 kg (2200 pounds).  (7) The aircraft shall be able to fly at a speed less than or equal to 90 m/s (200 mph).  (8) The electrical power available to the instrument shall be at least 150 Amperes of 28 Volts DC.  (9) There shall be access to attach a GPS antenna on the aircraft for positioning information gathered by the instrument. (10) The dropsonde system will require a tube to extend through the opening (described above) a short distance to allow the sonde to fall clear of the aircraft. Additionally, a 400 MHz aircraft antenna will need to be mounted on the underside of the aircraft to receive the sonde telemetry. (11) The cabin shall accommodate seats for up to 3 instrument operators on board and provide communications between the instrument operators and flight crew during the flight.
