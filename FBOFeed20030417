Award of a Time and Materials or a Firm-Fixed Price purchase order, using acquisition for commercial items/services procedures, is contemplated.  The performance period shall be 12 months from date of award.  The order will also include four option periods of 12 months each to be exercised after satisfactory completion of the current base period and/or option period.

PURPOSE:

   THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN  SERVICES (DHHS), OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY(OS), OFFICE OF GRANTS AND ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT (OGAM) PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT  TO CATHERINE DeLUCA CLOSING DATE IS MAY 1, 2003

   THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS TO PERFORM A VARIETY OF ANALYTICAL AND EVALUATIVE DUTIES CONNECTED WITH THE REVIEW OF THE PRE-AWARD GRANT PROCESS.  SPECIFICALLY THE CONTRACTOR SHALL REVIEW, ANALYZE, AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE GRANT REVIEW PROCESS, INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF GRANT ANNOUNCEMENTS, TARGET AUDIENCE DETERMINATION, AND FIELD READER/PEER REVIEW PROCESS.

  SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE CONTRACTOR'S EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE IN GRANT MAKING REQUIREMENTS, GUIDANCE, AND PROCESSES.  THE CONTRACTOR POSSESS IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF STATUTES, REGULATIONS, AND INTERNAL POLICY GUIDANCE GOVERNING HHS GRANT-MAKING FUNCTIONS AND IS ABLE TO READILY APPLY THIS KNOWLEDGE TO IDENTIFY STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE CONDUCT OF EACH REVIEW.  THE CONTRACTOR'S QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERTISE WOULD ALLOW THESE TARGETED GRANT REVIEWS TO BE COMPLETED IN A FASHION THAT PROVIDES THE OGAM AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND IMPLEMENT CHANGES IN A TIMELY MANNER.  THIS ACQUISITION WILL ELIMINATE THE ADDITIONAL TIME AND MONEY THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR ANOTHER CONTRACTOR UNFAMILIAR WITH THE REQUIREMENT. THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT TO AWARD THIS CONTRACT TO ANY CONTRACTOR BUT CATHERINE DeLUCA WOULD RESULT IN A  SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN COST.

<DESC>NA Estimated draft solicitation issue date is August 5, 2002.  Estimated closing date of draft solicitation is August 20, 2002.  Estimated final solicitation issue date is September 10, 2002. Estimated final solicitation closing date is October 10, 2002.  The  U.S. Army is in the process of modernizing all Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKOs).  Each SKO consists of a wide variety of tools and equipment essential to providing support to the Army’s inventory of technologically advanced tactical and combat support weapon  systems to meet the Army’s Ordnance and Combat missions.  This process is incremental.  With the completion of each redesign, each SKO will be procured and fielded. The Army is soliciting proposals from large and small businesses to establish long-term Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contracts for various tool sets, kits and outfits (SK0s).  It is the Army’s intent to make multiple awards under this solic itation to both large and small businesses.  Individual delivery orders will be competed among all awardees unless it is determined that a specific delivery order should be competed exclusively among small business awardees.  The Army will follow the Feder al Acquisition Regulation's  “rule of two” in determining whether a specific delivery order is to be competed among small business awardees (See FAR 19.502(b)). SKO's are defined as:   	Sets:  a collection of tools/components used by a group, section, squad, platoon or unit usually supplemented by tool kits to perform an organizational mission. Unit of issue of Set (SE) 	Kits:  An assembly of tools/components in a small pouch or box designed for use and carried by an individual or crew. Unit of issue of Kit (KT) 	Outfits: An assemblage of tools or equipment.  May include separately type-classified items as a component such as: Pneumatic Tool and Compressor Outfit, Water Purification Outfit, Tool Outfit Hydraulic Systems Repair and Tool Outfit Pioneer Portable Elec tric Tools. Unit of issue of Outfit (OT). For your information, Army Tools are defined as an instrument, implement, utensil, device or machine, powered or hand operated, used in diagnosis, making operating adjustments, performing damage or fault repair and preventive maintenance of Army material. In order to promote competition this requirement has been divided into the following segments: 1. Mechanical Maintenance Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final u se in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 2. Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final use in a  single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 3. Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools, measuring tools and equipment, or special-purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical maintenance or building trades.  These kits may be housed  in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 4. Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit i n a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually some of the components o f a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 5. Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually some of the components of the shop set are permanently mounted to its “carrier” by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to carry wartime operations. Each segment will be individually competed and awarded.  The Army intends to establish two award pools for each segment: one will be created under full and open competition and the other will be for small business concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more segments.  Each segment shall require offerors to submit a technical, performance risk and price proposal based on a sample SKO requirement.  The Army reserves the right to issue a delivery order on the sample SKO proposals.  The Army further reserves the right to issue an order under the award pool established under full and open competition or the award pool of small business concerns, depending upon proposals received. Small business concerns may compete for the award pool to be established under full and open competition and the pool to be established exclusively for small business concerns.  Small business concerns may submit alternative proposals based on meeting or n ot meeting the non-manufacturers rule (see 13 CFR 121.406).  Proposals based on meeting the non-manufacturers rule must be supported by adequate documentation. Offerors not receiving an award to be included in a pool of awardees will be debriefed and will have an opportunity to file a protest.   In the event that a requirement for a delivery order is competed exclusively among small businesses and only one offeror meets the nonmanufacturing rule, the contracting officer will issue the order to that offeror provided the price is fair and reasonable  and all other technical and past performance considerations are met.  The contracting officer will substantiate any determination regarding whether a price is fair and reasonable and will not consider a courtesy offer from a large business unless the cont racting officer determines that the small business offer is unreasonable.  In the event that the small business offer is unreasonable, the contracting officer may cancel the competition and compete the requirement among the full and open pool of awardees.  Finally, a small business who is otherwise eligible for award may apply for a COC if the contracting officer determines that the small business is unable to meet the nonmanufacturers rule. Interested potential offerors are invited to attend a pre-proposal conference to discuss the solicitation.  The Pre-Proposal conference will take place at The Lodge (formerly Jumers), Bettendorf, IA from 8:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, August 20, 2002.  This conference is open to all contractors.  The Pre-Proposal Conference will be a working luncheon.  The cost of the luncheon is $10.00 due by August 15th, 2002.  Checks will be made out to TACOM-RI Protocol and mailed to AMSTA-LC (Protocol/Laura Batchel or), TACOM-RI, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL 61299-7630.  Sorry no credit card transactions.  A limited number of reduced rate rooms at The Lodge (563-355-7141) are available by referencing group reservation number 984235.  Reservations must be made NL T August 5th, 2002 to receive the reduced rate.

<CONTACT>Brenda Wendling, (609)485-5153
<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.1.3.12, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry that the FAA intends to contract, in an amount greater than $100,000. The Federal Aviation Administration, William J. Hughes Technical Center, is seeking to award a competitive contract to provide continuing technical engineering support for the Surface Movement Advisor Free Flight (SMA Free Flight) Program.   Background:   SMA Free Flight is currently deployed in 16 airports throughout the country.  The SMA, used by the airlines, improves airport surface operations by providing Airline Operations Centers (AOCs) and airport ramp control personnel with near real-time aircraft position data and estimated time-to-touchdown information for arrivals in the terminal area.  It is currently anticipated that the SMA system will be expanded to at least 12 additional field sites. The objective of the proposed contract is to perform continued SMA support activities including system software and hardware maintenance updates and engineering.  Because SMA maintenance tends to be of a highly visible nature, and requires direct involvement with the airline industry, it is extremely critical that maintenance support is acquired without impacting scheduled engineering and operational activities.  This maintenance also includes 2nd level field support including a Help-Desk operation to respond to all SMA concerns and issues. Systems currently included in, and/or, affected by the work effort, are as follows: SMA ARTSIIIE (Automated Radar Terminal System) AGW (ARTS Gateway) system      interface Volpe NTSC (Volpe National Transportation System Center) SMA FFP1 Server SMA STARS (Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System) AIG system     interface SMA ARTSIIIA ODS (Optical Disk Subsystem) interface SMA Atlanta Prototype SF-21 Interface (Safe Flight 21) AMASS/TAIU Interface (Airport Movement Area Safety System/Terminal Automation     Interface Unit) The period of performance of the contract will be for 5 years, and the Government estimates a total contract ceiling of 10272 hours.  The contract type to be awarded will be Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Time and Material or Labor Hour Delivery Orders.  This procurement is 100% set-aside for Small Business.  The NAICS code for this requirement will be 541330 (Engineering Services).   Small business size standard is $4.0 million in annual receipts.  Award will be based on Best Value evaluation.  Technical abilities will be considered more important than cost, with the highest emphasis being placed on direct SMA experience. Companies interested in receiving a solicitation package and submitting a proposal for these services may submit a written request via mail, e-mail, or facsimile.  The request must state the solicitation number, DTFACT-03-R00009, the title, Surface Movement Advisor (SMA) Maintenance and Engineering Services, and that it is a request for a solicitation package.  It shall also contain the company point of contact, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address.  Since the solicitation will be issued electronically, it is essential that the e-mail address be included.  An e-mail submission is preferred over a hard copy or facsimile request.  Address request to the Federal Aviation Administration, William J. Hughes Technical Center, Attn:  Ms. Brenda Wendling, ACX-51, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ 08405.  The fax number is: (609)-485-4088.  The e-mail address is: Brenda.wendling@faa.gov .   No telephonic requests will be honored. The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the request for offers, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement. A screening information request is anticipated within 30-60 days of this announcement

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a negotiated procurement for Consolidated Facilities Management (CFM) services to operate and maintain the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library (Center) in Abilene, Kansas. Estimated Cost Range: $5,000,000 over a five (5) year period (Base Year of 12 months and four (4) Option Years of twelve (12) months each). The Contractor must provide all management, supervision, personnel, engineering, equipment and tools not furnished as GFP, materials, parts, supplies (i.e., light bulbs, filters, etc.), subcontracts, and transportation necessary to perform the Mechanical and Operational Maintenance, Janitorial/Custodial, Grounds Maintenance and Landscaping Services, including Snow and Ice Removal, at the Eisenhower Center in accordance with: (1) the manufacturer's recommendations and specifications; (2) industry standards and codes; (3) Federal, State, and local regulations; (4) GSA Preventive Maintenance Guides; (5) Federal environmental standards; and (6) OSHA regulations.  The Eisenhower Center is the traditional name given to the five-building complex which makes up the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library.  The Center is a part of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The Center consists of a 22- acre complex.  The Center receives on average 80,000 to 100,000 visitors each year.  Major events occur outdoors with attendance at times between 5,000 and 10,000.  The Center includes the Library, Museum, Family Home, Visitors Center, and the Place of Meditation that is also called the Chapel.  In addition to these five major structures, there is a service building with office space and a garage near the Library, a metal storage building near the service building, a fountain in front of the Chapel, a larger than life statue in the center of the grounds, five memorial Pylons at the east end of the Center, a kiosk housing a photo exhibit west of the Museum, and a working solar panel system east of the Museum.  Except for the Boyhood Home that is a wood frame house and the metal storage building, all of the buildings are constructed of native limestone. The Center and its grounds are open to and used by the public from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. seven days per week, 362(3) days a year.  Mechanical services are required 365(6) days a year, twenty-four hours a day, 7 days a week.

Tourists and local people also walk on our extensive sidewalks throughout the day, evening, and early daylight hours.  The Eisenhower Center has a very high level of visibility to Government, non-Government and international organizations. It hosts former Presidents, Heads of State, and other important visitors on an individual and group basis, with many social functions conducted at the Library facilities. As a result, the highest quality mechanical services are essential to the day-to-day operation of the Library.  The Presidential Library facility represents a significant investment that must be properly operated and maintained to prevent deterioration of the buildings and the invaluable records stored therein.  For the protection of documents which are sensitive to chemicals and atmospheric conditions, there are restrictions on the introduction of chemicals, gases, oils, etc.  Technical Evaluation Criteria:  Management Approach, Technical Understanding, Past Performance and Price.  A Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract with incorporated Department of Labor Wage Determinations is anticipated. The requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.

Major components of this work include conducting soil survey update mapping, provide supporting field notes, complete supporting soil profile descriptions and soil transects, and complete soil map compilation activities.  Any contract resulting from this solicitation will have a one-year base period and four one-year options.  The lowest price technically acceptable selection process will be used with any resulting award being a firm fixed price performance based service contract.  Firms will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria listed in the request for proposal to determine technical acceptability.  The solicitation will be unrestricted.  The solicitation will be available on or about May 9, 2003, and can be downloaded from this web site.  Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available.  All questions must be directed to the contracting officer in writing by e-mail at pat.pickett@vt.usda.gov, by facsimile to 802-951-6327, or by mail.  No questions will be accepted by telephone.

<DESC>Proposal Submission Place:  Mr. Minnesh Kaliprasad, Techno-economics and Planning, Mintek, 200 Hans Strijdom Drive, Randburg 2125, South Africa, Phone: 27 (11) 709-4668, Fax: 27 (11) 709-4659
POC: Evangela Kunene, Data Procurement Manager, USTDA 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209 Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax:703-875-4009, email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the development of an Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide (EMD) plant in South Africa. 

Mintek, the Grantee, is a publicly owned South African technology firm. It develops mineral and metallurgical projects and in this instance is working in concert with the Industrial Development Corporation, a South African financing institution for large infrastructure and industrial projects.  Mintek proposes the development of a new 15,000-20,000 metric ton per annum facility to supply world battery manufacturers with high-quality EMD.  The low cost of labor, inexpensive energy rates, and abundance of manganese combine to make South Africa an ideal site for high quality EMD production.  

EMD price is a function of its quality and chemical characteristics.  South Africa’s current production yields intermediate quality EMD that sells for $1400-1600 per metric ton.  This new facility at Coega would produce high quality EMD that sells for $1750-1800 per metric ton.  Mintek is eager to produce higher quality EMD in order to reap increased revenue and to secure sales contracts with international buyers, who require greater and more consistent supply.  

The tasks that would be completed for the feasibility study by the U.S. firm include: (1) Establish a study basis for the study; (2) Evaluate various technological options; (3) Estimation and evaluation of both capital and operating costs; (4) Conduct a market study of current and potential markets of EMD; (5) Identify and analyze potential sources of financing for the project; (6) Develop a preliminary project environmental impact statement for selected sites; (7) Prepare an analysis of various business options for the project; and (8) Prepare a final report detailing the results of the study.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $215,720 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). Mintek will perform all of Phase I and Phase II of the Terms of Reference at its own expense, which is estimated to cost US$50,000, with the exception of travel costs associated with Phase II, estimated at US$25,000, which will be arranged for by the Contractor and paid for with TDA Grant funds as set forth in the Grant Agreement.

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Navigation Systems Program Office, PMA/PMW-156, has a classified requirement for antenna apertures that are compatible with the GPS Antenna System 1 (GAS&#64979;1) Antenna Electronics (AE) in support of the Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) program. The antenna will have a low radar cross section (Low Observable (LO)) requirement. The antenna will have additional requirements of being conformal and M-Code compliant. The potential applications for these antennas include the F/A-18E/F and the antenna must meet the classified LO requirements.   The projected procurement quantity for the targeted platforms is approximately 545 (plus 10% spares) production units over the life of the program (base year plus multiple option years).   

The GAS-1 Antenna System consists of 2 Weapon Replaceable Assemblies (WRAs): the Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA), and the Antenna Electronics (AE). This Synopsis is for a conformal CRPA (C-CRPA) WRA only that interfaces with the GAS-1 AE (manufactured by Raytheon System Limited, Harlow UK). The goal of these antennas is to meet the performance requirements of the GAS-1 system with the additional requirements of being conformal, M-Code compliant and LO.    The antenna conformal design will be consistent with mounting on the top fuselage of the F/A-18E/F.  The antenna will need to conform to the contours of the aircraft surface.

 Potential offerors shall be required to provide representative “bid samples” of the antenna at no cost to the Government for the purpose of laboratory testing and establishing antenna characteristics during the RFP phase.   The Navy intends on utilizing Boeing Corporation to assist in reviewing the responses received under this synopsis. Proprietary or restricted information should be marked as such and will be protected.  Bid sample-testing will be conducted at Patuxent River NAS and at Boeing Corporation.  Offerors will be required to enter into Non Disclosure Agreements with Boeing and/or Northrop Grumman who may be involved in the source selection process. Due to the nature of this potential effort, no foreign country sources shall be considered. Prospective sources shall be required to have a DOD security classification at the SECRET level.

In order for industry to provide comments, submit questions and/or concerns on the technical requirements,  a draft specification will be released for review as part of a Request for Information (RFI) announcement that is anticipated to be  issued within the next three weeks. Any comments, questions, and/or concerns from industry will be requested to be submitted within 30 days after issuance of the RFI. The Government reserves the right to determine the applicability of the comments, questions and concerns in the final draft specification.

This announcement updates the previous synopsis dated June 25, 2002.

In the interest of acquisition streamlining, prospective sources are strongly encouraged to submit responses electronically to the Contracting Officer listed above.  The NAICS code for this action is 334511 and the FSC is 5826.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Answers to questions posed regarding subject solicitation. What evaluation / simulation is required?  System will be used for behavioral and response evaluation of subjects with  markers in a given area.  Their movement data will be recorded via the camera  system and used to for evaluation of behavioral and response motion.  These  movements include sudden responses and behavior as shock and surprise  movements.  Therefore, positional accuracy in millimeter range is a must.  What image / data format is required for above?  The software of the system should be flexible enough to convert the data into  different popular formats such as MS Excel, MS Word, and other useful  software.   How long is a recording? Current experiments will run for about 5 mins per session.  But system must be able to record X, Y, Z data for several hours continuously.  This gives 1.3GB/sec bandwidth. Is this a max or nominal?  What is the output  format of the camera? 1.3GB/sec bandwidth is max rate.  The output format of the camera is data that can show X, Y, Z data position of each marker in the field.  This system should  be able to track several hundreds of markers at a time. Others may have developed calibration for another project to 1mm under very  similar conditions (retro-reflective markers). They determine the position in X & Y. Do you expect this in real-time? For the current experiments, we do not anticipate real-time data results.  But  we would like to be able to upgrade the equipment if the need for real-time  data if the need arises although the amount of markers we could track would  drop considerably without further upgrading or increasing the numbers of  cameras being used.  It is important for the system to be able to determine all  3 (X, Y, and Z) data position to properly calculate position data in 3D  dimensions. Are there specifications for the off the shelf items such as tripods and made- to measure brackets as well? There no specifications for the off the shelf items as long as it is capable of  holding the cameras reliably. This should be dictated in FOV angle due to focal length of cameras to lens  fittings on digital cameras do not always match. What maximum f stop value do  you require? Correct.There was a mistake in the requirement.  The cameras do not have to  include 20mm lenses since it will be dictated by the FOV angle.  As long as the  net of cameras can cover a field area of about 150’ by 100’ and track all the  markers effectively, then there is no need for this specification.   What constitutes a flight case? Is this for operation or transport? The flight cases are used for safe storage if not used or for transport. What interface is required? TTL, sound, light, pre or post trigger? The interface should be controlled via computer software w/ friendly GUI. Kinematic software means any motion related item. Please clarify all the  processing needs. Software package must include software capable of retrieving and determining 3D  positioning data from camera system.  This software must include error  processing management that may result from buggy data retrieval or loss of  markers and be able to upgrade or synchronize with other software for movie  capture and polygonal effects and other various multimedia capabilities  currently out in the market. Easy and friendly GUI is a plus.

<DESC>This modification is to announce that the GSA FRPO has issued Amendment 1 to the FPDS-NG or FAMIS RFP.  This amendment re-issues Attachment J4, FPDS-NG Validation Requirements, due to it was discovered that when several pages are printed, namely pages 168, 169, 170, and 196, there were formatting errors that caused all of the information to not print out on the pages.  Attachment J4 has been re-formatted and re-posted.

Amendment 1 also re-posts the List of Industry Day Registrants,  due to numerous requests for a list of companies who have shown interest in this procurement so that teaming arrangements may be investigated.

For example, it would not be uncommon for approximately $750,000 - $1,000,000 worth of design services to be issued, negotiated and awarded during the 4th         Reby making the start and completion dates for such projects running concurrently. Question:  How would your firm and proposed Design Team(s) intend to handle a workload surge of such magnitude (i.e. numerous projects at different Installations) with start and completion dates all within the same time period? Responsiveness:   In certain instances, the DPW’s require immediate assistance that demands instant responsiveness by the A-E (i.e., same or next day) for mission essential directives that could include a scope development meeting, investigation of a facility, concept desig n, cost estimate or some other action requiring A-E services.

At times, designs completed by the A-E firm are under construction while the A-E contract is ongoing, while at other times after the completion of the contract.   Question:  How does your firm view A-E responsibility during construction? Does your firm view it as a continuation of the design process or as a separate  functional element of the Construction contract?   Question: How does your firm respond to design deficiencies discovered during construction involving a design completed by your firm?   Question:  What is the process for corrective action? Question:  What processes are in place for reviewing submittals during construction?

Capable sources are sought to perform software research and development for the IFE Division, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, Rome, NY (AFRL Rome).  The objective of this effort is to conduct Web-enabled Timeline Analysis System (WebTAS) software development and system support for various military commands and Government agencies. This effort  supports the Air Force in providing Department of Defense (DoD) commands, state, and federal agencies with a software toolkit that provides a general data visualization and analysis infrastructure for the analysis of temporal, spatial, entity, and association information.  The flexible WebTAS architecture exploits multiple data sources and provides data mining tools that facilitate trend and pattern analysis to support activity prediction.  This effort will perform engineering and technical tasks and operations and maintenance support for current and new users of the WebTAS software toolset.  Technical enhancements are needed to correct any identified shortcomings in the toolset and to provide additional capabilities, features, processes, and documentation.  The enhancements will extend WebTAS functions and provide more effective and efficient capabilities to meet the needs of the users.  Installation support will be needed to install the WebTAS software and train users at multiple sites throughout the world.  Operations and maintenance actions will be needed to provide continued system support to current customer sites, and to the new sites after system installation.  In the course of performance, the support personnel will interface with various DoD and Government agencies through visits and electronic means, and technical visits that will take place at various sites, worldwide.  The support personnel will also provide technical support to AFRL/IFE to assist in the analysis, design, development, integration, testing, and evaluation.  Anticipated deliverables include software and technical documentation.  An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months.  The prime contractor and their subcontractors for this contract must have a minimum of two (2) Top Secret SCI security clearances.  The WebTAS web site:  www.webtas.com will serve as the technical read library relating to the subject area of this acquisition and is available for review by any  potential offerors.  Access to the users manual and an evaluation request requires approval by the Government WebTAS Program Manager.  Prior to access being granted, respondents must submit a copy of an approved DD Form 2345, Contractor Access List (CCAL), along with a letter from the Data Custodian designated on that form, authorizing access by whomever will be reviewing the users manual and evaluation request, to the WebTAS Program Manager at the Air Force Research Laboratory/IFEA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, New York 13441-4514, or faxed to his attention at 315-330-4380.  For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Information Service at 1-800-352-3572 or on the web at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/.   Responses to this sources sought are requested from small businesses and will be used for market research purposes and possible set-aside.  Should the determination be made to select this as a small business set-aside, another notice will be posted reflecting such.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710 and the size standard for small business is 500 employees.  Respondents to this announcement should indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, or historically black college or university (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) (as defined by the clause at DFARS 252.226-7000).  As discussed at FAR 19.502-2(b)(1) and (2), in making R&D small business set-asides, there must be a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns and also a reasonable expectation of obtaining the best scientific and technological sources consistent with the demand of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performances, and schedule.  The same considerations would apply to any HBCU/MI set-aside.  Therefore, respondents should provide a statement of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions and resources necessary to successfully compete for this award.  This information will assist the Air Force in making a set-aside decision.  If available, provide information on similar contracts performed over the last five (5) years.  Include references, contract titles, dollar values, points of contact, and telephone numbers.  The Government will evaluate relevant experience information based on (1) information provided by the Offeror, (2) information obtained from the references provided by the respondent, and/or (3) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Respondents must demonstrate knowledge/expertise in the following areas:  web-based software technology, browser-based access, web publishing, data visualization, database mining, disparate data sources, multi-source data integration, ad-hoc querying, trend and pattern detection, distributed networking, near real-time situation alerting and prediction of upcoming events, and the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) certification and life cycle management process for software development and fielding.  In addition to the statement of capabilities, please provide answers to the following questions: (1) Does your company intend to submit a proposal in response to the upcoming solicitation as a prime contractor?  (2) How many people does your company employ?  (3) State how many SCI cleared personnel are currently available.  (4) Will you need to hire additional personnel to perform this effort?

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on engineering support for the development, fabrication, and test of Combat Identification (CID) System to be used by ground troops and provide a means for aircraft to distinguish friend and foe.  This is a request for information only.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) is planning to conduct an initiative that will evaluate the feasibility and advantage of CID technology.  The envisioned system should utilize small, lightweight, passive technology that allows troops on the ground to be readily identified by support aircraft during day/night engagements.  Given that capability, Combat Air Forces could reduce fratricide in a battlefield environment.  The AEFB is primarily interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be adapted for this purpose.

The AEFB is seeking information from industry representatives who would be interested in providing an operational prototype item for this initiative demonstration.  The objectives of this initiative include demonstrating a technology that can provide ground troops with a means to be identified by Combat Aircraft, via RFID tag technology, or something similar.  The RFID tags would be passive and activate once interrogated by aircraft or ground weapons systems. CID Tags needs to have the capability to be incorporated into personnel protection systems, such as helmet, flak vest, or weapon system.     The system should operate instantaneously, be durable, flexible, and withstand a temperature range of  -40C to 100C. 

Request information be submitted NO LATER THAN 18 May 2003 to MSgt John Bitrick, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  MSgt John Bitrick can be reached at (208) 828-3521.  Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for conducting this initiative.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>The IRS is seeking the services of a contractor to deliver cultural awareness and sensitivity training to approximately 80,000 employees ranging from front-line employees through executives. The target delivery window begins in late calendar 2003 and should conclude before the end of calendar 2004. The purpose of this training is to positively impact taxpayer contact through improved customer service by increasing employees’ (1) awareness of various cultures and how culture impacts a person’s response; (2) knowledge to function more effectively in multicultural environments; (3) skills to increase the level of cultural competence, cross-cultural conflict resolution, and creative problem-solving; (4) ability to eliminate communication barriers for more effective, accurate, and respectful interactions; and (5) actions to implement this new knowledge, awareness, and skill.

The content should come from existing, already developed, commercial “off-the-shelf” courses. We are looking for the training to be between two and three hours per class, developed for traditional classroom delivery (paper-based) as well as e-learning/online delivery. We intend to conduct a pilot of the course before agency-wide distribution. 

The focus of this training is on cultural awareness and sensitivity, not diversity or equal opportunity. 

Firms which have interest in and capability to compete for this requirement should forward a Statement of Capabilities of not less than two or more than seven pages to Renate Birwe, 1301 Clay Street, Rm. 640S, Oakland, CA  94612.

<SUBJECT>--SLAMRAAM SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION WITH OPTIONS FOR PRODUCTION, ENGINEERING/TECHNICAL SERVICES, CONTRACTOR LOGISTICS SUPPORT, FIELDING SUPPORT, SPARES
<DESC>NA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) to solicit concept papers in order to determine which U.S. firms have the highest probability of designing and producing the Surface-Launched Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (SLAMRAAM) system.  Responses to this RFI w ill be used by the Government to determine which prospective prime contractors will be granted access to additional intelligence information at the Joint Service/DOD level.  This additional information is restricted to U.S. companies only and is necessary to submit a proposal in response to the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for the SLAMRAAM procurement.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:  The SLAMRAAM System includes a fire unit using a HMMWV/Army common carrier, the USAF AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, GPS receiver, land navigation system, EPLRS/SINCGARS radios, FBCB2; Sentinel ETRAC and JLENS sensors; and an integrat ed fire control station (IFCS). The IFC capability will be developed using maturing BMC4I technologies, will integrate sensor data, engagement operations, and force operations, and is to be the initial fielded capability for the Air and Missile Defense Tac tical Operations Center. CONCEPT PAPER:  The contractor is requested to submit a concept paper (not to exceed 10 pages in length) that addresses the contractor’s experience in developing and producing major systems, either for the military or commercial sector, at a level of compl exity similar to the SLAMRAAM development effort described below.  The contractor should present an overview of its initial concept for meeting the requirements for a SLAMRAAM system as described in draft SOW and System and Launcher Specification documents , which can be found at the SLAMRAAM Industry Website (see instructions below for requesting website access).  The concept paper should focus on the contractor’s concept for Integrated Fire Control, first for the SLAMRAAM system, and second as a building b lock toward a common AMD TOC for Patriot, MEADS, and JLENS.  The contractor should briefly describe its proposed system architecture and the concept for functional capabilities such as the ability to share a common air picture, conduct netted and distribut ed command and control operations, and interoperate with legacy Stinger-based systems.

The housing shall be side servicing for filter installation and removal. Housing design shall allow air to enter and exit the housing without changing direction. The housing shall accommodate standard size filters that do not require any special attachments or devices to function properly during or after installation. (B) Welding and Cleaning: All pressure retaining weld joints and seams shall be continuous welding. All manufacturing scratches and weld heat discoloration shall be removed by Mil Spec. Glass Beads in a clean non-contaminated atmosphere. Housing will be free of any gasket sealing and sharp edges. All weld joints and any portion of any gasket sealing surface shall be ground smooth and flush to base metals. (C) Housing Hardware: All hardware used in the manufacture and assembly of the filter housing shall be a minimum of 300 series stainless steel (i.e. nuts, bolts, washers, springs, etc.) except for the brass nuts used for filter access door retaining. (Aluminum knobs are to protect against galling of stainless steel threaded parts (ERDA 76-21, 6.2.2 Housing Construction). (D) Removal Gasket Seal Filter Clamping Mechanism: The filter clamping device (locking tray) shall be operated by means of a standard wrench from outside the housings front. The filter clamping device shall be on the clean side of the dirty air or down stream and be interchangeable. The filter clamping device is self aligning and adjustable by means of springs used in a compression bar assembly. The filter clamping device shall produce a minimum of 1,500 (fifteen hundred) pounds of pressure to ensure a proper and uniform filter to frame seal along its gasketed surface. The filter clamping device is driven by stainless steel acme threaded shafts and ½-10 brass acme nuts to prevent gauling (the use of acme thread allows the filter clamping device to seal each filter with only ten foot pounds of torque). The filter access door is sealed to the housing front by means of a white FDA approved skinned silicone closed cell gasket. Silicone gasketing will ensure memory during prolonged compression (will never lose its shape or composition) and is replaceable. Each filter access port has a bag clamping ring (bag-in ring). The bag-in ring has a smooth hemmed edge to ensure safe installation and removal of the filter change out bag. The bag-in ring is seal welded to the housing front completely around the filter access port. It is designed with two raised ridges to stretch the filter change out bag elastic mouth around. The bag-in ring and filter change out bag is concealed behind the removable filter access door. The filter access door is clamped in place with the use of torque to specified tightness. The filter change out bag shall be constructed of LP-375C Class 2 PVC flexible material and shall be yellow in color. The filter bag is matted on one side to reduce static and is transparent. The filter bag shall have a clear portion at the mouth for visual purposes and two glove ports for filter manipulation and one filter change out bag is retained to the bag-in ring by means of a strap for an air tight seal. (E) Factory Testing: The filter housing shall be manufactured under a factory quality assurance program that addresses the requirements of ANSI/ASME. The filter housing shall be tested for liter fit, filter clamping, surface flatness. (F) Low Leak Isolation Damper Construction: Damper will be positive seal isolation type which is to be low leak at a differential pressure of 10-inch water gage. Damper is to be constructed of 11FA and ¼-inch T-304 stainless steel. The damper has a ½-inch THK. Silicone solid disc, sandwiched between two 1.8-inch THK. Stainless steel plates which rotates on its axis.
