<SUBJECT>99--FLUE GAS CLEANING SYSTEM:  MULTIPOLLUTANT CONTROL RESEARCH FACILITY, PHASE 2
<SOLNBR>PR-CI-01-12567
<CONTACT>CHARLES D. MCCORMICK, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513/487-2047, E-Mail: MCCORMICK.CHARLES@EPA.GOV
<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency's National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) has a requirement for a contractor to design, manufacture, and install the Phase II - Flue Gas Cleaning System (FGCS) portion of the Multi pollutant Control Research Facility (MPCRF) operated by NRMRL's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division (APPCD)in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The MPCRF supports research and development of new flue gas cleaning technologies for stationary sources of air pollution.  By using a multiple fuel combustor to provide flue gas and state-of-art emission control technologies, the research studies can closely mimic actual emission sources, while developing cutting -edge techniques and hardware to meet current and future emissions regulations. Phase I, the multiple -fuel combustor was awarded in May 2001under EPA Contract 68-C-01-003 to Arcadis, Geraghty & Miller.  The MPCRF is to operate in two "modes" based upon the operation of the research combustor.  During research testing when coal or oil is being combusted, the MPCRF operates on coal or oil perhaps 8 -12 hours per day and the balance on natural gas to maintain system temperatures and gas flow.   When specialized tests are being conducted, the system will operate on natural gas only and "doped" with surrogate components.  The MPCRF Combustor is sized so that viable multi pollutant flue gas cleaning technologies may be tested, modeled and scaled up for commercial applications.  For wet-dry gas absorption and electrostatic-based particle removal technologies, this is typically 1000 - 2000 acfm.  In addition, the combustor shall have gas velocity and temperature profiles reasonably close to commercial systems, such that combustor modifications and combustor sorbent-particle interactions may be coupled with cooler flue gas cleaning technologies.  The combustor shall be able to fire pre-ground (pulverized) coal, distillate oil and/or natural gas at 3 - 6 million Btu/hr, yielding the above flue gas flow at 300 degree Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius), entering into the MPCRF's wet and dry flue gas cleaning systems.  Under Phase II, the Contractor will provide two parallel flue gas cleaning systems. One system will be a saturated gas (wet) flue gas cleaning system removing pollutants as a liquid, and the other will be a semi-dry facility removing collected pollutants as a dry solid residue.  The EPA  anticipates awarding a firm fixed price contract for this requirement using full and open competitive procedures.  The NAICS Code is 33911101. All responsible sources who submit a proposal will be considered.   Solicitation PR-CI-01-12567 will be posted on the Internet where it may be downloaded. The direct link URL is http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  No hard copies will be available. It is the responsibility of offerors to frequently check FEDBIZOPS or the EPA website address for updates or changes.  It is anticipated that this solicitation will be released in mid June 2002 with responses due in thirty (30) days.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>1. Supervisory Controls

	The Health, Population & Nutrition Specialist (HPNS) is supervised by the SA?DE+ Team Leader and performs under general instructions and guidance from his/her supervisor.  Once general responsibilities and assignments are agreed upon, the Specialist is required to exercise extensive technical and professional judgment in organizing, planning and supervising child survival and reproductive health implementation activities.  This includes identifying the approaches to be taken, resolving problems and conflicts, and meeting deadlines.  The incumbent is required to work with minimum supervision and in collaboration with other offices of USAID/Mozambique, other donors and Ministry of Health (MOH) professionals.  The HPNS is responsible for keeping his/her supervisor appraised of implementation issues related to child survival and reproductive health, and actions to be taken to overcome difficulties and achieve meaningful and quantifiable results.  Completed work is not expected to require substantive modification.  The HPNS?s responsibilities require considerable situational assessment, interpretation, judgment, and timely decision making.  S/he will engage mid- to high-level government officials in policy dialogue regarding matters pertaining to the Mission?s child survival and reproductive health portfolio, including Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI), infectious disease initiatives (polio, malaria), family planning, safe motherhood and integrated maternal and childhood disease control issues.  The HPNS will be primarily responsible for identifying, analyzing, formulating and implementing child survival, infectious disease and family planning and reproductive health programs and activities.  These could include designing, describing and quantifying expected results and performance indicators; providing guidance to implementing partners in making necessary adjustments to program and administrative plans; and preparation of precise, accurate, articulate, complete and professionally written technical documents and program descriptions. 

2. Introduction

	Since the end of the civil war in 1992 and the signing of the peace accords in 1994, Mozambique has been struggling to reestablish its rural health care network destroyed during the war.  It is also trying to establish an adequate management system for the health services; the health service is constrained by high levels of infectious diseases, malnutrition, HIV/AIDS, and limited number of trained health personnel.  USAID continues to be at the forefront in ensuring that services are available to the rural poor where more than 85% of Mozambicans reside.  Since 1998, the USAID has been working to strengthen the ability of the Ministry of Health to deliver essential primary health care at fixed facilities, while U.S. PVOs complement MOH services with community outreach.  USAID?s activities cover more than half of all districts in the country and provide services to an estimated 11.3 million people, including over 2.1 million women of child bearing age and 900,000 children under five years of age.  Currently, over 60% of Mozambicans in these districts (compared to <25% in 1992) now have access to health services.  However, quality remains a concern as staff in many rural facilities have only rudimentary education.  There are only 70 secondary schools in the country and more than 65% of these are located in Maputo, the capital. The MOH employs approximately 18,000 persons at the elementary (52%), basic (29%), intermediate (13%), specialized-intermediate (2.5%), and superior (3.5%) levels.  The elementary level requires no schooling, the basic level requires 3 years of schooling, intermediate level requires 6 years of schooling, and the superior level requires a university degree.  Only a tiny fraction of the 18,000 MOH employees are in the non-clinical professional or administrative classifications.  There are 81 hospital administratorsat the elementary level, 149 at the basic level, 158 at the intermediate level and 12 at the superior (with a bachelor?s degree) level; there are only 16 accountants in the MOH service.  There are only 400 physicians in Mozambique, of whom 25% are specialists.  Mozambique has one of the lowest ratios of doctors to patients in the world (1:35,000).  Most physicians are recent graduates with little public health experience.  For many years to come, Mozambique will continue to rely on foreign talent to help it operate its public health system.  USAID is committed to training Mozambicans to be able to assume more leadership roles in the future through mentoring of junior level personnel.  SAUDE+ has employed a senior level FSN-10 to be mentored by the HPNS for a period of two years, after which it is hoped that the FSN can assume a higher level of responsibility. 

	The HPNS is directly responsible for achieving results associated with child survival and reproductive health under the health (SAUDE+) program.  These are two major activities that were once separate.  In 2000, however, the Mission made a conscious decision to integrate the implementation of these two programs to conform to the MOH structure. S/he provides technical support on child survival and reproductive health issues, as well as STDs and HIV/AIDS.  S/he will also mentor some SAUDE+ staff as possible replacement in the near future.  In this regard, the HPNS performs a wide range and variety of duties of substantial complexity, including consultative, advisory, and monitoring, management, information gathering, processing, and reporting of program performance and accomplishments.  The incumbent provides vital liaison services with Mozambique's professional health community, including the entire spectrum of medical and paramedical personnel, and is responsible for staying abreast of technical developments in the areas of child survival, nutrition and reproductive health. 

	The SA?DE+ portfolio will be approximately $108 million over a six-year period.  The HPNS plays an integral role in the design of all activities related to child survival and reproductive health project documents and the design and management of new activities financed thereunder.  The incumbent will manage certain implementation contracts and awards to non-government organizations working under the SAUDE+ program, as assigned by the Team Leader and Contracting Officer.  In addition, s/he will be responsible for coordinating USAID/Washington-supported projects assigned by the Team Leader.  The HPNS will be called upon to provide technical support as a technical backup for the design and implementation of the Health Sector Support Project or other SAUDE+ activities in the absence of other SAUDE+ team members.  Additional activities will be assigned as additional funding becomes available and SA?DE+ roles and assignments are modified in light of changing circumstances.

INTRODUCTION.     The Overseas Private Investment Corporation ("OPIC" or the "Agency"), an agency of the U.S. Government, is seeking a private equity investment advisor (the "Advisor") to assist the Agency's Investment Funds Department ("IFD") in analyzing our existing portfolio and developing an annual allocation system for future investment funds.

BACKGROUND.  The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (?OPIC?) is a self-sustaining U.S. government agency that assists U.S. private investment in over 140 emerging market economies and developing countries through four principal activities:  project finance, political risk insurance, private equity investment funds and outreach activities.  OPIC assisted projects are required to uphold important American values as they pertain to human rights, workers rights, the environment, and the impact on the U.S. economy.  Over the agency's 31-year history, OPIC has supported $138 billion invested in 3,000 projects, generating over $10 billion in host-government revenues and nearly 668,000 host-country jobs.  OPIC projects have also generated $63.6 billion in U.S. exports and create nearly 250,000 American jobs.

OPIC?s investment funds program currently supports capital commitments of $3.4 billion in 28 privately owned, privately managed investment funds that make direct equity and equity-related investments in new, expanding or privatizing companies in 140 emerging market economies.  The capital structure of each fund is comprised of OPIC-guarantied debt and private equity commitments.

OPIC intends to develop a system for developing an annual asset allocation plan which will take into account the objectives of OPIC?s management and stakeholders, as well as OPIC?s present credit exposure to funds, to determine the Agency?s future allocations in support of investment funds.***** 

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:  CONSULTANT TO DEVELOP SYSTEM FOR DEVELOPING AN ANNUAL ASSET ALLOCATION PLAN.   The Advisor shall work with IFD management to develop a strategy for creating an annual investment allocation plan consistent with the objectives of OPIC?s management and stakeholders that can be used by the Agency to determine future support of investment funds in OPIC-eligible countries.*****

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.    ASSISTANCE IN DEVELOPING INVESTMENT ALLOCATION PLAN.

Assist IFD in creating a strategy and methodology to develop an annual investment allocation plan.  Consideration shall be given to objectives of OPIC?s management and stakeholders, as well as to present credit exposure.  The Advisor shall assist OPIC in developing an allocation strategy that will consider overall allocation of credit exposure, fund sizes, deal sizes, number of partnerships, and the time and resources necessary to execute the plan.  The strategy shall include appropriate consideration to the current portfolio risk exposure, valuations, flow trends, as well as absorptive capacity in OPIC's markets, to what degree the markets have the preconditions for successful private equity investing, and the potential to have a developmental impact.  The plan will then be designed to cover OPIC's markets in dollar amounts consonant with this absorptive capacity, and focusing on
maximizing developmental impact without incurring losses.*****

DELIVERABLE ITEMS.  The Advisor shall deliver the following items to IFD:

A. A framework for analyzing OPIC?s existing portfolio consistent with the criteria described above;
B. An analysis of OPIC?s existing portfolio consistent with the criteria described above;
C.  A framework for creating an annual allocation taking into account the factors listed above, and
D. Assist IFD in developing its asset allocation plan for FY 2003.*****

<DESC>NA NOTICE OF INTENT SYNOPSIS.  For the past 29 years, the EPA has purchased approximately 90% of the research animals utilized by the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory under an indefinite quantity contract from Charles River Laboratories.  The animals are required for the conduct of a long-range series of short- and long-term research studies on health effects of a wide range of pollutants under varying conditions.  This effort will be procured on a sole-source basis from Charles River Laboratories.   The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  Approximately 80% of these studies are of a continuing or comparative nature and will require additional animals of the same strains, species, sex, age, and microbiologic and virologic history as well as genetic background.  Published studies by a variety of research organizations, including EPA, Veterans' Administration, and the Department of Defense, have demonstrated that nominally identical animals from different sources of supply will react differently under identical protocols.  These reactions result from subtle variables in genetic virologic and bacteriologic backgrounds.   The Agency has concluded that where inter-comparability of data is required from one study to another, it is necessary to use a common source of supply to eliminate extraneous variables.  Use of animals from a supplier other than Charles River would introduce such genetic, microbiological, and virological variables which would invalidate the research data base and make comparability of data scientifically impossible.  For these reasons, the Agency has decided to solicit Charles River Laboratories on a non-competitive basis for the majority of its laboratory animal requirements.   Approximately ten types of animals of various sexes, ages, weights, etc., will be purchased, including Long Evans Hooded (outbred) Rats; CD (outbred) Albino Rats; Wistar (outbred) Albino Rats; CDF (inbred) Albino Rats; CD-1 (outbred) Albino Mice; DBA/2N HYBRID Mice; B6C3F1 HYBRID Mice; C57BL/6 HYBRID Mice; Balb/C (inbred) Mice; and Hartley-Strain Guinea Pigs.   The primary basis for limiting competition is the Agency's conclusion that there is substantial evidence that animals that are not identical genetically, virologically, and bacteriologically to animals previously used in our research introduce unquantifiable variables into the research protocol and that such variables cast unavoidable doubt on the significance of variations on research results.  That element of doubt is of such concern to EPA that it would require a definitive and conclusive demonstration of the error of the conclusion before opening this solicitation for competition.   It is anticipated that the contract will be a firm fixed price, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery type of contract.  The contract will have a base period of 12 months plus four 12-month options.  Anyone wishing to request reconsideration of the Justification for Non-Competitive Procurement must provide such a demonstration to the Agency within 15 days of this Notice.  Any such information submitted will be evaluated according to its conclusiveness.*****

Simplified procedures as described in FAR 12.3 will be used for acquisition of these commercial items.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

Solicitation Number N00421-02-T-0067 is being released using simplified acquisition procedures as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.3, and is therefore issued as a request for quote (RFQ).

Due to the proprietary nature of Microsoft technical information, as described in FAR 27.401, "Restricted computer software," and DFARS 227.7202-1(c)(1), Microsoft is the sole manufacturer with the exclusive technical capabilities to fulfill the Government's minimum requirements.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contemplates awarding a cost type contract to provide culture confirmation of influenza illness and sub-typing of influenza A viruses isolated from specimens obtained from infants at multiple study sites. A multi-site cohort study will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of maternal influenza vaccination to prevent influenza in infants < 6 months old. The study will be conducted in multiple seasons because the severity of influenza epidemics varies from year-to-year. Women who will be in their 2nd or 3rd trimesters of pregnancy from November through March will be offered the current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)-recommended inactivated influenza vaccine during the fall of each year. The infants of influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers will be followed for medical and immunological outcomes until age 6 months. During the study period, providers at participating sites will obtain nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (or similar respiratory specimens) from infants who meet the case definitions for testing eligibility in the approved study protocol, and will submit these specimens for virus isolation. The study period at the sites will allow consistency in viral isolation, testing, typing and sub-typing of influenza A virus isolates. The agency is seeking a laboratory capable of performing the procedures described to confirm influenza in study participants at all study sites and to provide consistency for viral identification for all sites. The period of performance will be a 12-month basic contract period with two (2), 12-month options which may be exercised at the Government's discretion based upon the availability of funds for that fiscal year. The solicitation will be available on or about April 25, 2002. The date specified for receipt of offers will be approximately 45 days after the solicitation issue date.  Interested parties may obtain an electronic copy of the solicitation by downloading it from www.eps.gov.  A limited number of hard copies of the solicitation will be available by submitting a written request to the attention of Chima Ume by facsimile at (770) 488-2777 or by email at CAU9@CDC.GOV.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  Requests for the RFP must specify RFP No. 2002-N-00406. All responsible sources that meet the above requirements may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.

Attention: Mr. G. Steve Lowry

The High Priority Projects is herein referred to as the Project.  The Project includes, but is not limited to replacement or addition of approximately 43 kms of transmission mains, replacement of approximately 78 kms of distribution lines, upgrades to seven existing water treatment plants, and construction of a new bulk chlorine storage facility.  Also included is an O&M advise and assist and training period. The Project will be implemented under the United States Agency for International Development(USAID) Egypt Utilities Management (EUM) Grant No. 263-0270.02.  It is expected that AWGA will enter into a contract with a prequalified U.S. firm for construction of the Project and as the Employer.  The contract will be based on USAID's Model Contract for Host Country Contracting Construction Only.  The resulting contract will be financed with local currency and U.S. dollars. The local currency payments will be made by the Employer. The Project is estimated to exceed US$ 70 million to be paid in US$ and LE, subject to availability of funds.  This Project is expected to be a combination of lump sum prices with certain unit price items.
USAID has certain approval rights, including approval of firms selected for prequalification, approval of the firm selected to be awarded the contract, and approval of the actual contract.  However, USAID will not be a party to the resulting contract, and its approval rights are not to be construed in any case as making USAID a party to the resulting contract.
Firms interested in becoming prequalified for the Project must submit complete responses to all questions in the PQQ.  Submissions containing incomplete or unanswered questions will not be considered.  The Employer will evaluate applications for prequalification under the evaluation criteria set forth in this PQQ.  Only prequalified firms will be permitted to submit bids for the construction of the Project.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Proposal number is N62645-02-R-0010.  Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07 are incorporated.  NAICS 325413/SIC 2835.  Naval Medical Logistics Command has the following requirement for immunoassay reagent for d-Methamphetamine/Amphetamine for use in the DoD Military Drug Testing Laboratories.  The resulting contract will be a requirements type contract with a base year (CLIN 0001) and four option years (CLINS 0002-0005).  The estimated number of tests per year is 3.5 million.  SOW.  C.1  REQUIREMENTS FOR IMMUNOASSAY SPECIFIC SCREENING REAGENT FOR d-METHAMPHETAMINE.  C.1.1  The materials shall be for the immunoassay of d-methamphetamine and amphetamine in urine and is to provide immunologic reagent for initial (screen) testing.  The reagent must provide equivalent or better performance characteristics of sensitivity and specificity for detection of d-methamphetamine and amphetamine in urine as the current immunoassay procedure employed in the military laboratories.  The reagent must possess sensitivity to d-methamphetamine and amphetamine when present at a concentration equal to or greater than 500 ng/mL of urine. The reagent must be compatible for use with the Roche Modular Chemical Analyzer System (DDP) and must be applicable without modification of the equipment.  The reagent must be compatible with the optimal throughput of the Roche Modular Chemical Analyzer System (DDP) and must not interfere with the optimum performance of the other immunoassay procedures performed on the instrument.  C.1.2 Sensitivity and Specificity.  The reagent shall be used for the identification of d-methamphetamine and amphetamine associated with drug abuse in physiological urine specimens.  The reagent must provide equivalent or better performance characteristics in terms of sensitivity and specificity for detection of d-methamphetamine and amphetamine in urine as the current immunoassay procedure used in the military laboratories.  Recognizing that physiologic urine specimens from amphetamine drug use may contain other by products of synthesis, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay should maximize the antibody cross-reactivity to d-methamphetamine and amphetamine when present at a concentration equal to or greater than 500 ng/mL of urine.  The immunoassay reagent must minimize the cross-reactivity with other pharmacological drugs or metabolites commonly associated with cold medication containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.  The immunoassay reagent must minimize cross-reactivity with the drugs or drug metabolites listed as follows.  DoD laboratory certified solutions of pure d-methamphetamine or amphetamine at a concentration of 500 ng/mL will be used for calibration of the Roche Modular Chemical Analyzer System (DDP).  The testing reagent must detect better than 95% of all quality control specimens containing d-methamphetamine or amphetamine at concentrations equal to or greater than 125% of the DoD cutoff concentration of 500 ng/mL.  The immunoassay reagent must also maintain reproducibility in quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) measurements.  The following drug cutoffs (in ng/mL) in urine specimens are currently used by the DoD for the initial immunoassay and GC/MS confirmation tests.  11 Nor delta 9 THC carboxylic acid (THCCOOH), 50, 15; Cocaine (Benzoylecgonine), 150, 100; Opiates (Morphine), 2000, morphine 4000, codeine 2000; Phencyclidine (PCP), 25, 25; Amphetamine/Methamphetamine/MDMA/MDA, 500, 500; Barbiturates (secobarbital), 200, 200; Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 0.5, 0.2.  C.1.3  Compliance with Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Requirements.  C.1.3.1  Immunoassay kits are medical devices and must have clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be marketed.  The registration and listing process specified by the FDA must be followed and the manufacturer must adhere to good manufacturing processes (GMP) in the manufacture of the devices.  Any mandatory recalls of the kits provided under this contract and any other problems that require notification to the FDA must be resolved as required by the FDA regulations current at the time.  The contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any recall or FDA notification within two working days of the event.  C.1.4  The materials provided must be in volumes and packaging, which are convenient and applicable to the throughput of the military laboratories and should not result in the loss or unnecessary disposal of more than 3% of the working volume of reagent.  Any individual bottle of reagent which would be prepared for use at one time may not include materials for more than 3,000 tests.  The contractor will not be required to provide calibrators and control materials for the drug reagent.  (The military laboratories will separately obtain or provide calibrators and control materials to be used with the reagent.)  The materials must be provided with an instruction sheet that complies with all requirements of the FDA and includes data demonstrating specific performance characteristics, such as, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, and safety precautions.  The instruction sheet(s) shall include procedures optimized for military drug testing laboratory operations as represented in these specifications and cutoffs as utilized by the DoD.  The Government will not develop procedures or optimize the performance of a kit for the contractor.  C.1.5  Shelf life.  Minimum shelf life of any unopened component of the assay shall be at least 180 days from date of delivery at the drug testing laboratory.  Once the kit container seals are broken and the component opened, the shelf-life must be at least 14 days.  Once diluted, the material must have a shelf life of at least 24 hours.  C.2  TESTING and QUALITY CONTROL PROTOCOL.  The following testing and quality control protocol will be used for all military testing.  The reagents supplied must be adaptable to the calibration requirements and characteristics of the Roche Modular Chemical Analyzer System (DDP).  Verification of each calibration will be accomplished with a drug free control, a control at 75% of cutoff concentration, a control at 125% of cutoff concentration and a control at 200% of cutoff concentration.  An acceptable verification will have analytical readings for the drug free <75% <cutoff <125% <200% controls. Open and blind quality control urine will be distributed throughout a test batch and will make up about 10% of the number of total specimens.  The reagent must meet the performance criteria outlined in C.1.2 and C.3.1 using this testing protocol.  C.3  CHARACTERISTICS OF d-METHAMPHETAMINE  REAGENT.  C.3.1  The reagent shall identify specimens containing d-methamphetamine and amphetamine in human physiological urine.   The assay shall identify as positive by the initial test better than 95% of the quality control specimens that contain 625 ng/mL or more of d-methamphetamine or amphetamine used as a control material.  The testing reagent must be specific for  d-methamphetamine and amphetamine such that better than 95% of the actual human physiological test specimens containing d-methamphetamine or amphetamine identified as positive by the current immunoassay and GC/MS procedures employed in the military laboratories, will be identified as positive by the offeror's immunoassay reagent on the Roche Modular Chemical Analyzer System (DDP).  The reagent must also minimize the number of "false positive" screens requiring GC/MS confirmatory analysis due to the presence of cold medications containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine or other over-the-counter medications.  Cross reactivity with l-methamphetamine and l-amphetamine should be minimized.  Better than 80% of the specimens identified as presumptive positive by the offeror?s screening reagent must confirm for the presence of d-methamphetamine or amphetamine at or above the GC/MS confirmation cutoff of 500 ng/mL by the procedures used in the military laboratory.  A specimen is considered to be a "false positive" screen if GC/MS fails to detect the presence of d-methamphetamine, or amphetamine at the levels of quantitation of the instrumentation as defined in the military drug laboratories.  The reagent shall demonstrate linearity for d-methamphetamine or amphetamine to 250% of the DoD immunoassay cutoff concentration.  C.3.1.1 The contractor and the government shall cooperate to collectively work toward a decrease in the cross-reactivity to the presence of cold medications containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and also to decrease cross-reactivity to l-methamphetamine or l-amphetamine which are known to cause excessive "false positives" requiring undue burden in the GC/MS confirmation procedures.  The contractor would adjust the performance of the reagent antibody and the government would provide a venue to test the performance using control and real samples.  C.3.2  An assay of 100 sequential aliquots of each of the following quality control samples using the reagent must correctly identify better than 95% of the 75% controls as negative and 125% controls as positive.  The coefficient of variation for the calibrators, and controls at concentrations of 75%, 125% and 200% of the calibrator, must be less than 7.5%.  A batch will consist of 100-300 samples tested between verifications of calibration.  Throughout the testing of the batch, there must not be significant drift in control values.  C.3.3  Better than 95% of the open low concentration quality control samples (75% of the 500 ng/mL d-methamphetamine and amphetamine immunoassay cutoff) must produce negative results in each analytical run and as calculated on a weekly basis.
C.3.4  Better than 95% of the open positive quality control samples (125% of the 500-ng/mL d-methamphetamine and amphetamine immunoassay cutoff) must be identified as positive in each analytical run and as calculated on a weekly basis.  C.3.5  An assay of 20 sequential controls containing drug at 200% of the cutoff concentration must all screen positive and have a coefficient of variation of the mean concentration reading less than 7.5%.  C.3.6  Each immunological reagent shall be checked for cross reactivity to other illicit or pharmacological abused drugs, chemicals, or metabolites that might produce a false positive response.  C.3.7  The immunological reagent shall be checked for cross-reactivity to each drug/metabolite listed in C.1.2.  The reagent must not give a positive assay result for any of the drug/metabolites listed from any of the other six drug classes when they are in concentrations at 100 times the screening cutoff concentration or the solubility limit of the drug in urine, whichever is less.  C.3.8  The contractor must provide upon request 250 ml of drug free (free of amphetamines, LSD, THCCOOH, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, barbiturates, PCP, and opiates, and must also contain less than 20 ng/mL of benzodiazepines) urine with each reagent kit order (equivalent to 2,000 tests/reagent kit).  The drug free urine provided with the reagent must have a GC/MS drug concentration less than the limit of quantitation for the analyte methodologies.  In addition, immunoassay of the drug free urine should have a semi-quantitative concentration readings equivalent to or less than those recorded for drug controls at 20% of the DoD immunoassay cutoff concentrations.  The negative urine should not be sent automatically.  If a laboratory requests negative urine, it may be shipped with the monthly reagent delivery and supplied in approximately 1 liter volume containers.  The military laboratories cannot redeem or exchange unused allocations of negative urine accrued by reagent purchase for additional reagents or other supplies from the vendor.  C.4  QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS SHALL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS.  C.4.1  Chemicals and Reagents  C.4.1.1  Quality and authenticity.  All materials used in the preparation of reagents should be verified as to authenticity and purity.  Methods may include, but are not limited to, the determination of melting points, and GC/MS, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and spectrophotometric measurements.  C.4.1.2  Stability.  The kit and each kit component must be shown to be stable and at the correct concentration over the period of use of the kit. Components that are homogeneous solutions must not deteriorate throughout the period of use of the kit (from date of preparation to date of expiration).  C.4.2  Manufacturers Equipment  C.4.2.1  Preventive maintenance.  Routine preventive maintenance procedures, periodic calibration, and any unscheduled maintenance must be fully documented and in accordance with recommendations of the manufacturer of the equipment.  C.4.2.2  Calibration and operational checks.  All instruments that are used to check a physical parameter of a solution or material must be calibrated and have documentation available to demonstrate that all required operational checks have been completed.  This includes gamma counters, pH meters, spectrometers, micropipettes, etc.  C.4.2.3  Temperature checks.  Water baths, refrigerators, freezers, and other equipment that maintains a given temperature must be periodically validated for accuracy and routinely verified for correct settings.  C.4.2.4  Glassware and other reusable laboratory supplies.  Appropriate procedures for cleaning and inspecting glassware and other reusable materials must be established and compliance documented.  C.4.3  Antibody Drug Molecule  C.4.3.1  Authenticity.  The prepared antibody drug molecule must be verified to be authentic and its purity established.  C.4.3.2  Stability.  The antibody drug must be documented to be stable to the expiration date and the immunoassay must meet all contract specifications to the end of expiration date (which is 180 days minimum).  C.4.4  Antibody specificity.  Antibody specificity must be verified for each lot and the specificity reevaluated at routine intervals to ensure uniformity and quality of preparations. The reagent must provide equivalent or better performance characteristics in terms of sensitivity and specificity for detection of d-methamphetamine and amphetamine in urine as the current immunoassay procedure used in the military laboratories. The number of "false positive" screens requiring GC/MS confirmatory analysis due to the presence of cold medications containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine or other over the counter medications must be minimized.  Cross reactivity with l-amphetamine and l-methamphetamine must also be minimized.  Better than 80% of the specimens identified as presumptive positive by the offeror?s screening reagent must confirm for the presence of d-methamphetamine or amphetamine equal to or above 500 ng/mL by the GC/MS procedure in the military laboratories.  The immunoassay reagent must be specific for d-methamphetamine and amphetamine such that better than 95% of the actual human physiological test specimens containing d-methamphetamine and/or amphetamine and identified as positive by the current immunoassay and GC/MS procedures employed in the military laboratories, will be identified as positive by the offeror?s immunoassay reagent on the Roche Modular Chemical Analyzer System (DDP).  Chemical compounds that may reasonably be found in urine resulting from prescription or non-prescription drug use must be tested to characterize antibody specificity.  Specificity testing will include biochemical materials produced normally in the human body (this may be evaluated by testing numbers of specimens of normal human urine).  C.4.4.1 The contractor and the government shall cooperate to collectively work toward a decrease in the cross-reactivity to the presence of cold medications containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and also to decrease cross-reactivity to l-methamphetamine or l-amphetamine which are known to cause excessive "false positives" requiring undue burden in the GC/MS confirmation procedures.  The contractor would adjust the performance of the reagent antibody and the government would provide a venue to test the performance using control and real human samples.  C.4.5  Immunoassays  C.4.5.1  Technical performance.  Performance of each lot of kits must be verified.  The verification must establish, as a minimum, the appropriate response to the target molecule and that all other parameters as specified in the contract are met.  C.4.5.2  Stability.  The performance parameters involved in the testing procedures must be verified and documented to be consistent throughout the shelf life of the kit.  C.4.5.3  Manufacturer's production manual.  Procedures and criteria required to validate all components (and materials) employed during the manufacture of the reagents in the test kits and the operation of the completed kit over the entire period of shelf-life of the kit must be described in detail.  All steps of each quality control procedure shall be described thoroughly.  C.4.5.4  Records.  The production and quality assurance records generated by each procedure performed above must be maintained in a systematic fashion to permit the verification of completion of all production parameters and shall be available for inspection during the term of the contract.  C.4.5.5  Corrective action.  When a specified quality control parameter is found to be out of control limits, the action taken to ensure correction for existing kits (i.e., notification) must be documented and action taken to ensure that the deficiency does not reoccur and all records must be retained. The Contracting Officer must be notified within 2 working days of any deficiencies in existing kits and of all corrective actions.  The FDA must be notified according to its regulations.  C.4.5.6  Lot numbers.  Lot numbers must be used to identify reagent and other preparations to allow tracking of all immunoassay components.  The procedures used to assign unique lot numbers for each solution or reagent must be described.  A single lot number for a kit will suffice if all materials used in that lot number can be tracked to identify the materials and procedures used in the preparation of that kit.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items apply with the exception of (d), (f), (h) and (i), which are reserved.

CLIN 0001 Purchase of Adaptive Technology, 1 lot.

This statement of objectives (SOO) is for the purchase of commercial adapter technology in support of the Standard Procurement System (SPS) Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) sponsored by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA).  This technology insertion is to facilitate systems integration and support an open architecture for the SPS product.  A commercially available product is required, having core competency in listed objectives, and be available for purchase.  Contractor must be able to provide integration and adapter development support with the Procurement Desktop-Defense (PD2) Sybase database.  Section 2, Background:  The SPS JPMO is in the process of acquiring and fielding a commercially based standard application to support the automation of contracting offices throughout the Department of Defense (DoD).  This program will continue for several years and will include the use of modern technologies for software applications, communications, security, data migration and data warehousing.   Section 3, Objectives:  To provide adaptive technology and integration support to the SPS JPMO to enable the SPS product to better integrate with other systems and provide an open environment for data manipulation.  The technology must support:  Enterprise implementation and solutions; Support multiple databases; Facilities for identifying and alerting on failed transactions or other alterable conditions; Ability to integrate with PD2 Sybase relational database management systems (RDBMS); Declarative approach to defining relationships and interfaces; Enable ?universal interface? approach, normalized format; Provide managed approach to evolving information formats and business rules; Flexibility in formatting and rules to enable smooth technology and architecture migrations; Provide ability to define transactions in appropriate formats (i.e. ebXML, XML, EDI, etc.); Adapter tools must permit simple, graphically based design of formatting and mapping instructions; All information consumed or produced by SPS must be mapped to the adapter with relationships maintained.  Section 4, Tasks: 
Task 1, Adaptive Technology:  The Contractor shall provide an automated self-install adaptive solution to enable an open architecture for the SPS application in support of the objectives listed above.  This solution will enable the creation of adapters using a graphical user interface (GUI) to result in defined transactions in the appropriate format using a declarative approach to refining relationships and interfaces.  Enterprise implementation capability of the solution is required (i.e. adapter solution in one location can support multiple databases/locations).  The solution must integrate with the existing Sybase RDBMS and PD2 data structure.  Enterprise license for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) product and maintenance for updates/changes in subsequent years must be identified.  Task 2, Adapter Development:  The Contractor will be responsible for working with the Government, its representatives and the development contractor, American Management Systems, Inc. (AMS), and the SPS product to develop the adapter(s) and document type definitions (DTDs) needed to provide an open integration solution.  The anticipated scope of the effort would include definition of:  inbound purchase requisition, bi-directional award, bi-directional modification, outbound solicitation, inbound offeror response, inbound organization, inbound vendor, bi-directional contract closeout, outbound federal procurement data system (FPDS) data, bi-directional commitments, bi-directional application advice and outbound milestones.  Documentation regarding installation and adapter operation must be included.  This documentation must be capable of being used as a self-training aid for the adapter.  This effort will result in a Government-owned utility (adapter) and documentation.  The updates/changes to the utility (adapter) would be the responsibility of the Government.  FAR part 52.227.7013 applies to this utility (adapter).  Task 3, Contractor Reporting: The Contractor will prepare and provide project updates plan on a bi-weekly basis.  Section 5, Contract Deliverables:  The destination point for all deliverables is the SPS JPMO or a site specified by the SPS JPMO.  All deliverables will be delivered in Microsoft Office 2000 or applicable application on CD.  Each deliverable will be determined acceptable or unacceptable to the Government within ten (10) calendar days after date of delivery.  Delivery of the adaptive technology is required by October 31, 2002.  The Period of performance will be receipt of award through December 31, 2002.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with FC Business Systems to develop a GradeDec Submodel and provide training for the submodel.  FC Business Systems developed FRA's current software program called the GradeDec 2000, a computer program which is used to contribute dollar estimates of capital investment requirements for highway-rail grade crossings to the Department of Transportation's Conditions and Performance Report to Congress.  The GradeDec 2000 program performs most of the required calculations at the level of the individual crossing but does not provide a complete analysis of national grade crossing investment needs.  FC Business Systems has the background knowledge and experience needed to create a submodel of the GradeDec 2000.  A submodel would improve the FRA analysis of national grade crossing investments and would include improved traffic flow algorithms; a dynamic investment improvement selection process, and the ability to evaluate the percent change in social and highway user costs weighted by traffic volumes at a different investment levels for each year of the 20-year analysis period.  The applicable authority for this announced intention is that under 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  This task is not a competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a competitive RFQ is not available.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Laboratory of Biochemistry plans to procure an iCycler iQ Real Time Detection System in accordance with the Simplified Acquisition Procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in the FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, No RFQ-NCI-20049-NQ, includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 01-07. The North American Industry Classification Code is 334516, and the business size standard is 500 employees.   Researchers of the Laboratory of Biochemistry, frequently use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to quantify nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) concentrations in samples during research into the fundamental mechanism of cellular processes related to cancer causes and prevention.  Currently, the Laboratory of Biochemistry is using end-point reactions combined with gel electrophoresis of final products to measure RNA and DNA concentrations.  Due to the large number of samples, and technical issues having to do with the PCR reaction itself, end-point analysis is compromised with regards to reliability and reproducibility. The use of an instrument to monitor PCR amplification in real-time, using fluorescent probes, eliminates these problems.  The NCI requires an iCycler iQ Real Time Detection System with the following minimum capability specifications and the mandatory specifications: 1) the ability to analyze up to 96 samples at one time; 2) the ability to detect up to four different fluors at one time, with minimal spectral overlap; 3) an instrument with a halogen (wide spectrum) light source with excitation and emission filters; 4) the ability to use Taqman, molecular beacon and SyBr Green probes in a simple and user-transparent manner, with software to aid in the design of all probes; 5) signal application for optimum sensitivity in detecting samples with low target concentrations; 6) mandatory requirements: sample block with thermal gradient capability, to minimize reaction optimization time (particularly important, as the instrument will be used by multiple users with multiple probe combinations, each of which must be optimized with regards to reaction temperature).    Offers shall demonstrate that their offered product meets the mandatory and minimum capability specifications herein in order for all other specifications to be considered.  Offeror must provide descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other materials in sufficient detail to demonstrate that their offer meets the foregoing requirements.  The literature furnished must also show the item to which the specifications herein pertain to.  The anticipated purchase order will be awarded to the responsible offeror with the lowest price offer that fully meets the requirements of this solicitation.  The offer should include a fixed price for all equipment, delivery, and other applicable charges.  In addition to the aforementioned descriptive literature, offers must also be accompanied by a completed and signed NCI Representations and  Certifications, and other Statements of Offerors or Quoters (Simplified Acquisitions).  The award document will incorporate the requirement of FAR 52.213-4, Terms & Conditions-Simplified Acquisitions.  Full text copies of these documents maybe obtained from Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, at (301-402-4509 ).  Offers must be submitted on an SF-18 that is signed by an authorized representative of the offeror and include a compete "Schedule of Offeror Supplies/Services".  The offer should include a fixed price for all equipment delivery installation, training, and other applicable charges.

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a matched pair of Digital Cameras for use in stereo particle image velocimetry (SPIV) and background of oriented stereo schlieren (BOSS) studies.  The cameras, capable of acquiring high-resolution digital images to quantify the aerodynamic characteristics of the flow in the wake of rotor blade and under low-light conditions, are to be used in the Ames Aeromechanics Laboratory at NASA Ames Research Center. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/ARC intends to purchase Digital Cameras and proVISION software license, from Integrated Design Tools, Inc. (IDT), 2074 Centre Pointe Blvd., Suite 103, Tallahassee, FL 32308, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) based on the fact that the Integrated Design Tools, Inc. has proven track of record to design and deliver acquisition hardware as well as software specific to SPIV images to meet the requirements of the Ames Aeromechanics Laboratory.  In addition, IDT has currently been used to establish a "first-generation" capability at ARC for image acquisition and analysis, which includes licensed software for interfacing with this class of camera.  In order to continue with this development and to advance our SPIV capabilities to include BOSS, NASA Ames intends to procure from IDT an additional license along with more advanced cameras.   It is critical that the digital cameras purchased have the following specific characteristics:  1) cross-correlation type; 2) CCD 1360 x 1030 pixels (or greater), 1 x 1, up to 4 x 4 binning; 3) thermoelectrically cooled; 4) high quantum efficiency (&gt; 40% at 532 nm) and extended spectral sensitivity; 5) firewire output with 12 frames per sec at full resolution and 100 frames per sec with ROI; and 6) compatible with IDT proVISION software (currently licensed by NASA Ames).  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:30 p.m. local time on June 4, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order consisting of a base period of seventeen months and two one-year options to extend the term of the contract to ApplyYourself, Inc., of Fairfax, VA for procurement and implementation of ApplyYourself's commercially available i-Class Application System and related services (e.g., maintenance, help desk services).  The purchase order will be awarded under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The system will be used by the NIST Baldrige National Quality Program to automate its examiner application process.  After implementation of the i-Class system, potential BNQP examiners will be able to submit and manage their application data securely through a Web-based transaction system.  NIST determined after extensive market research and after release of a previous competitive solicitation and receipt of quotations that, while several companies may be able to develop a new system that can meet NIST's requirements, only ApplyYourself has a commercial off-the-shelf system that can meet NIST's BNQP examiner requirements.  In addition, the ApplyYourself i-Class system is significantly less expensive and represents less risk to NIST than systems that would have to be developed.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by sending an email to Joseph.Widdup@nist.gov no later than Friday, May 31, 2002.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, all quotations received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This was missed in the original posting.  Under cutoff 125 per cent, under 200 per cent controls. Open and blind quality control urine will be distributed throughout a test batch and will make up about 10% of the number of total specimens.  The reagent must meet the performance criteria outlined in C.1.2 and C.3.1 using this testing protocol.  C.3  CHARACTERISTICS OF d-METHAMPHETAMINE  REAGENT.  C.3.1  The reagent shall identify specimens containing d-methamphetamine and amphetamine in human physiological urine.   The assay shall identify as positive by the initial test better than 95% of the quality control specimens that contain 625 ng/mL or more of d-methamphetamine or amphetamine used as a control material.  The testing reagent must be specific for  d-methamphetamine and amphetamine such that better than 95% of the actual human physiological test specimens containing d-methamphetamine or amphetamine identified as positive by the current immunoassay and GC/MS procedures employed in the military laboratories, will be identified as positive by the offeror's immunoassay reagent on the Roche Modular Chemical Analyzer System (DDP).  The reagent must also minimize the number of "false positive" screens requiring GC/MS confirmatory analysis due to the presence of cold medications containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine or other over-the-counter medications.  Cross reactivity with l-methamphetamine and l-amphetamine should be minimized.  Better than 80% of the specimens identified as presumptive positive by the offeror?s screening reagent must confirm for the presence of d-methamphetamine or amphetamine at or above the GC/MS confirmation cutoff of 500 ng/mL by the procedures used in the military laboratory.  A specimen is considered to be a "false positive" screen if GC/MS fails to detect the presence of d-methamphetamine, or amphetamine at the levels of quantitation of the instrumentation as defined in the military drug laboratories.  The reagent shall demonstrate linearity for d-methamphetamine or amphetamine to 250% of the DoD immunoassay cutoff concentration.  C.3.1.1 The contractor and the government shall cooperate to collectively work toward a decrease in the cross-reactivity to the presence of cold medications containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and also to decrease cross-reactivity to l-methamphetamine or l-amphetamine which are known to cause excessive "false positives" requiring undue burden in the GC/MS confirmation procedures.  The contractor would adjust the performance of the reagent antibody and the government would provide a venue to test the performance using control and real samples.  C.3.2  An assay of 100 sequential aliquots of each of the following quality control samples using the reagent must correctly identify better than 95% of the 75% controls as negative and 125% controls as positive.  The coefficient of variation for the calibrators, and controls at concentrations of 75%, 125% and 200% of the calibrator, must be less than 7.5%.  A batch will consist of 100-300 samples tested between verifications of calibration.  Throughout the testing of the batch, there must not be significant drift in control values.  C.3.3  Better than 95% of the open low concentration quality control samples (75% of the 500 ng/mL d-methamphetamine and amphetamine immunoassay cutoff) must produce negative results in each analytical run and as calculated on a weekly basis.
C.3.4  Better than 95% of the open positive quality control samples (125% of the 500-ng/mL d-methamphetamine and amphetamine immunoassay cutoff) must be identified as positive in each analytical run and as calculated on a weekly basis.  C.3.5  An assay of 20 sequential controls containing drug at 200% of the cutoff concentration must all screen positive and have a coefficient of variation of the mean concentration reading less than 7.5%.  C.3.6  Each immunological reagent shall be checked for cross reactivity to other illicit or pharmacological abused drugs, chemicals, or metabolites that might produce a false positive response.  C.3.7  The immunological reagent shall be checked for cross-reactivity to each drug/metabolite listed in C.1.2.  The reagent must not give a positive assay result for any of the drug/metabolites listed from any of the other six drug classes when they are in concentrations at 100 times the screening cutoff concentration or the solubility limit of the drug in urine, whichever is less.  C.3.8  The contractor must provide upon request 250 ml of drug free (free of amphetamines, LSD, THCCOOH, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, barbiturates, PCP, and opiates, and must also contain less than 20 ng/mL of benzodiazepines) urine with each reagent kit order (equivalent to 2,000 tests/reagent kit).  The drug free urine provided with the reagent must have a GC/MS drug concentration less than the limit of quantitation for the analyte methodologies.  In addition, immunoassay of the drug free urine should have a semi-quantitative concentration readings equivalent to or less than those recorded for drug controls at 20% of the DoD immunoassay cutoff concentrations.  The negative urine should not be sent automatically.  If a laboratory requests negative urine, it may be shipped with the monthly reagent delivery and supplied in approximately 1 liter volume containers.  The military laboratories cannot redeem or exchange unused allocations of negative urine accrued by reagent purchase for additional reagents or other supplies from the vendor.  C.4  QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS SHALL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS.  C.4.1  Chemicals and Reagents  C.4.1.1  Quality and authenticity.  All materials used in the preparation of reagents should be verified as to authenticity and purity.  Methods may include, but are not limited to, the determination of melting points, and GC/MS, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and spectrophotometric measurements.  C.4.1.2  Stability.  The kit and each kit component must be shown to be stable and at the correct concentration over the period of use of the kit. Components that are homogeneous solutions must not deteriorate throughout the period of use of the kit (from date of preparation to date of expiration).  C.4.2  Manufacturers Equipment  C.4.2.1  Preventive maintenance.  Routine preventive maintenance procedures, periodic calibration, and any unscheduled maintenance must be fully documented and in accordance with recommendations of the manufacturer of the equipment.  C.4.2.2  Calibration and operational checks.  All instruments that are used to check a physical parameter of a solution or material must be calibrated and have documentation available to demonstrate that all required operational checks have been completed.  This includes gamma counters, pH meters, spectrometers, micropipettes, etc.  C.4.2.3  Temperature checks.  Water baths, refrigerators, freezers, and other equipment that maintains a given temperature must be periodically validated for accuracy and routinely verified for correct settings.  C.4.2.4  Glassware and other reusable laboratory supplies.  Appropriate procedures for cleaning and inspecting glassware and other reusable materials must be established and compliance documented.  C.4.3  Antibody Drug Molecule  C.4.3.1  Authenticity.  The prepared antibody drug molecule must be verified to be authentic and its purity established.  C.4.3.2  Stability.  The antibody drug must be documented to be stable to the expiration date and the immunoassay must meet all contract specifications to the end of expiration date (which is 180 days minimum).  C.4.4  Antibody specificity.  Antibody specificity must be verified for each lot and the specificity reevaluated at routine intervals to ensure uniformity and quality of preparations. The reagent must provide equivalent or better performance characteristics in terms of sensitivity and specificity for detection of d-methamphetamine and amphetamine in urine as the current immunoassay procedure used in the military laboratories. The number of "false positive" screens requiring GC/MS confirmatory analysis due to the presence of cold medications containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine or other over the counter medications must be minimized.  Cross reactivity with l-amphetamine and l-methamphetamine must also be minimized.  Better than 80% of the specimens identified as presumptive positive by the offeror?s screening reagent must confirm for the presence of d-methamphetamine or amphetamine equal to or above 500 ng/mL by the GC/MS procedure in the military laboratories.  The immunoassay reagent must be specific for d-methamphetamine and amphetamine such that better than 95% of the actual human physiological test specimens containing d-methamphetamine and/or amphetamine and identified as positive by the current immunoassay and GC/MS procedures employed in the military laboratories, will be identified as positive by the offeror?s immunoassay reagent on the Roche Modular Chemical Analyzer System (DDP).  Chemical compounds that may reasonably be found in urine resulting from prescription or non-prescription drug use must be tested to characterize antibody specificity.  Specificity testing will include biochemical materials produced normally in the human body (this may be evaluated by testing numbers of specimens of normal human urine).  C.4.4.1 The contractor and the government shall cooperate to collectively work toward a decrease in the cross-reactivity to the presence of cold medications containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and also to decrease cross-reactivity to l-methamphetamine or l-amphetamine which are known to cause excessive "false positives" requiring undue burden in the GC/MS confirmation procedures.  The contractor would adjust the performance of the reagent antibody and the government would provide a venue to test the performance using control and real human samples.  C.4.5  Immunoassays  C.4.5.1  Technical performance.  Performance of each lot of kits must be verified.  The verification must establish, as a minimum, the appropriate response to the target molecule and that all other parameters as specified in the contract are met.  C.4.5.2  Stability.  The performance parameters involved in the testing procedures must be verified and documented to be consistent throughout the shelf life of the kit.  C.4.5.3  Manufacturer's production manual.  Procedures and criteria required to validate all components (and materials) employed during the manufacture of the reagents in the test kits and the operation of the completed kit over the entire period of shelf-life of the kit must be described in detail.  All steps of each quality control procedure shall be described thoroughly.  C.4.5.4  Records.  The production and quality assurance records generated by each procedure performed above must be maintained in a systematic fashion to permit the verification of completion of all production parameters and shall be available for inspection during the term of the contract.  C.4.5.5  Corrective action.  When a specified quality control parameter is found to be out of control limits, the action taken to ensure correction for existing kits (i.e., notification) must be documented and action taken to ensure that the deficiency does not reoccur and all records must be retained. The Contracting Officer must be notified within 2 working days of any deficiencies in existing kits and of all corrective actions.  The FDA must be notified according to its regulations.  C.4.5.6  Lot numbers.  Lot numbers must be used to identify reagent and other preparations to allow tracking of all immunoassay components.  The procedures used to assign unique lot numbers for each solution or reagent must be described.  A single lot number for a kit will suffice if all materials used in that lot number can be tracked to identify the materials and procedures used in the preparation of that kit.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items apply with the exception of (d), (f), (h) and (i), which are reserved.  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items is not applicable.  The following Proposal Instructions and Evaluation Factors will be used.  1. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF PROPOSALS.  1a.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Combat Support Systems, System Program Office at Eglin AFB, FL, seeks sources and information on methods and products to rapidly expand parking ramp space capable of supporting C-5, C-17, C-141, C-130 or F-15 aircraft at contingency/expeditionary airfields located anywhere in the world.  Methods for expanding aircraft parking areas may include the innovative use of chemicals, materials, and compounds for soil stabilization and/or the use of state-of-the-art, high-strength, lightweight matting.  There is an ever-increasing need to park transport aircraft to facilitate on- and off-loading of cargo and personnel.  Often, the forward operating locations have very limited, usable aircraft parking areas, due to age deterioration, their original construction/purpose, or due to damage caused during the contingency.  It is essential for the Air Force to have the capability to very rapidly repair/expand/create contingency airfield parking on any surface/soil type.  Potential suppliers should note that that the Government is looking for a system solution, rather than a simple replacement for AM-2 matting; however, if matting is included in the solution, the Government is looking for performance improvements such as lighter weight (not to exceed 3 pounds per square foot, if possible), no more than two-person lift required, not to exceed the thickness of the AM-2 mat, and low cost.  The Government wants to involve industry in the very early stages of this acquisition.  To initiate an exchange of information the Government requests that interested parties submit any or both of the following: (1) a paper, with conceptual sketches if applicable, that identifies potential/existing solutions or (2) product brochures or marketing materials outlining specifications/capabilities.  As part of your response, please include information on delivery/lead-time, warranty terms and conditions, and whether your product is commercially available.  Responses will be evaluated and a list of potential suppliers will be established containing those firms determined capable of fulfilling the Government?s requirements.  At a later date, the Government may acquire, one or more units for initial testing and a subsequent purchase of an unspecified number from one or more of these vendors.  This sources sought/request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any follow-on acquisitions. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.  The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this RFI.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  For further information concerning technical aspects contact Mr. Jon Simone, Program Engineer, or Lt. Jennifer Gould, Program Manager, AAC/WMO, 314 W. Choctawhatchee Ave, Suite 104, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5717, or by telephone at (850) 882-4684, extensions 317 and 321, respectively, e-mail addresses are: jon.simone@eglin.af.mil or jennifer.gould@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC), Woods Hole, MA, is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to assess the market for a handheld electronic data logging device for use at sea by domestic sea sampling observers to record data electronically.  NEFSC is conducting a market search for hardware and software that meets performance specifications focusing on a ruggedized tablet and GPS technology as a first priority. 

BACKGROUND
	Currently, NMFS observers generally use paper log sheets and note paper to record vessel data, position data, catch data and bycatch data, as well as take records for marine mammals, turtles and sea birds. Conceptually, the cost of data entry can be reduced and data quality improved by recording the data at the first possible point in the data stream which is as the data is collected by the observer. An electronic method of data collection at the observer level would do several things: First, it would allow for error checking at the time of data collection rather than weeks afterwards; Secondly, it would eliminate data transcription errors which commonly occur;  Third, it could allow for trip information to be electronically transferred to NMFS and eliminate delay and possible loss of data through handling.  Overall, improvements in the quality and timeliness of observer data will better support decision making based on these data.
	Market research to date indicates that ruggedized tablets, combined with ruggedized global positioning system (GPS) units  are the single most feasible approach for collecting complex observer data electronically under adverse conditions at sea.  This RFI is a market search focusing on a ruggedized tablet and GPS system that meets program requirements, and for development/integration of software to demonstrate its application for collection of observer data. 

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
	The minimum requirements of the device for which the Government is seeking information should be as follows:

Unit and System requirements:
	The unit must be in a tablet format (no lap tops)
		Shock resistant, non-corrosive, ruggedized tablet.  Able to withstand a possible drop from several feet.
	Scaled to prevent water (water resistant) or dirt from penetrating the unit.
	At least 500MHZ processor (higher preferred)
	256 MB DRAM
	At least 1 gig memory.
	Durable Interface to PC's or the Internet.
	Display:
		Screen must display standard data forms (8.5 x 11 inches) for input.
		Touch screen capable display with at least 800 x 600 resolution 
		(prefer 1024 x 768)
		Screen must be readable in direct sunlight.

		At least 8 MB of Video RAM
	
	Other items:
		Waterproof and ruggedized carrying case (such as Pelican)
		Battery charger and additional battery - battery must hold a charge
		for at least 4 hrs. of continuous use and have a sleep or battery save mode.

	Environmental Specifications:
		Temperature operating tolerance of -4 degree -+140 degree Fahrenheit.

The minimum requirements of the software for which the Government is seeking information should be as follows:

		Programmable to emulate current data forms.
		Capable of auditing entered data to acceptable parameters (limits).
		Capable of continuous storage/backup.
		Communicates with PC's or internet for data transmission to program manager.
		Capable of having 150 pages of logs active on a trip.

NOTE: Specific details should be provided which address unit's standards for temperature, humidity, altitude, shock and vibration

	This RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), but rather, is an exploratory request to obtain pricing, market information, and capabilities for planning purposes.  The Government is seeking to identify and resolve concerns regarding the acquisition strategy and the feasibility of the requirement as well as any other industry concerns or questions.Respondents are asked to provide responses which provide specific capabilities of  units which could satisfy the above referenced requirements as well as preliminary cost/price projections associated with the products to be provided.  Please identify any previous Government contract experiences which are relative to this request.  This RFI is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or, ultimately, award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any awards be made as a result of this RFI.  Any costs incurred as a result of responding to this RFI shall be borne by the respondent and cannot be charged to the Government for reimbursement.  All information in this RFI represents an overview of the anticipated project, and is subject to change, and is in no way binding on the Government.  The Government will acknowledge receipt of submissions but will not provide any feedback.  Respondents are asked to provide information using WordPerfect 6/7/8 or Word files forwarded via e-mail  Please limit responses to no more than twenty pages.

<SOLNBR>N6554002SS0062
<RESPDATE>061202
<CONTACT>AUDREY M. DAVIS, PROJECT ENGINEER, (215)897-1380,FAX (215)897-7980, EMAIL davisam@nswccd.navy.mil
<DESC>The US Navy is considering employing portable, handheld gas analyzers on submarines and is seeking information regarding current industry capabilities.  NAVSEA Philadelphia and the Naval Research Laboratory are inquiring as to those capabilities in order to establish the limits of commercially available technology.   These analyzers are not intended to be replacements for a submarine's primary atmosphere monitoring system.  Instead, devices are primarily needed to back up the central monitoring system in the event of its malfunction and to assist in the event of a casualty such as a fire.  Analyzers shall be handheld, portable instruments that will be used to measure individual atmosphere constituents/contaminants (multiple analytes can be combined into one analyzer).  The majority of constituents/ contaminants to be measured by the new handheld devices have been previously quant ified onboard submarines using colorimetric devices.  Any analyzer submitted for consideration as an example of current technology should not exceed 0.5 ft3 in size, regardless of the number of measured constituents/ contaminants.  In general, analyzers should be rugged, reliable, user friendly and field compatible; ideally, analyzer should incorporate several sensors into one platform.     The Navy is particularly interested in hand-held, portable analyzers that can combine analyses of certain contaminants on one hand-held device.  One device should be capable of measuring oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and/or combustible gases.  A second device should be capable of measuring aromatic hydrocarbons, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen chloride, and/or nitrogen dioxide.  A third device should be capable of measuring ammonia, sulfur dioxide, monoethanolamine and/or ozone. Th e Navy is also interested in cost, stability of production, performance, operation in a submarine environment and maintainability.  In general, an acceptable analyzer should (a) perform mandated measurements with sufficient accuracy, precision and long term reliability; (b) maximize the number of sensors within a given instrument in order to minimize the total number of onboard analyzers; (c) minimize the size and cost of the selected instruments; (d) minimize the need for calibration and maintenance. If available, an acceptable analyzer should perform as follows: (a) range of measurement should be from 50% of the 90 day limit to 50% above the one hour limit for each gas measured.  (b) it is desirable but not mandatory that devices' minimum measurable concentration shall be 10% of the 90 day limit for each of the gases measured; (c) operating temperature range shall be be tween 20-50oC and operating humidity range shall be between 35%-95% relative humidity; device must exhibit no interference between measured gas and others present in atmosphere.  Typical atmospheres include 50 ppm hydrocarbons; 1, 000 ppm hydrogen, 5,000 ppm carbon dioxide, 20 ppm carbon monoxide and lower concentrations of various contaminants such as halogenated hydrocarbons. If needed, a more detailed description of the desired capabilities of the analyzers can be provided. Replies should be sent to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, 5001 S. Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19112-1403 Attn:  Audrey Davis, Code 822.

Discharge from a water treatment system may contain levels of nitrates as high as 2,500 ppm nitrates.  This concentration prohibits discharge to a water storage pond that will support the water treatment system.  

The concentration of nitrates can be addressed in two locations in the system.  The discharge from the existing water treatment system has a flowrate of 10 gpm with a concentration up to 2,500 ppm nitrates.  This is the preferred location of treatment. 

A reverse osmosis (RO) unit is available down stream of the water treatment system.  The concentration of nitrates in the water running through the RO unit is reduced to a concentration of less than 10 ppm.  A brine solution of water is generated that may contain concentrations as high as 9000 ppm nitrates is generated at a flowrate of approximately 3 gpm.  This brine solution can be treated and the water discharged.  With the operational costs associated with the RO unit, it is preferred that the water from the water treatment system be treated at a flowrate of 10 gpm.

Technologies sought for the treatment of nitrates will minimize operator requirements and minimize energy and maintenance costs.  Proposed treatment technologies should be submitted with a general cost of the system, operational restrictions, and operational and maintenance cost requirements.  Potential vendors should also include a corporate history of work with the process and locations of similar systems in operation.  

MSE will evaluate treatment technologies based on the information supplied for this process.  Formal request for proposals will be submitted to potential vendors for providing a system and potential installation.
