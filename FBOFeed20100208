<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center's (ASC) KC-X Program Office, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is releasing a Presolicitation Notice for the KC-X Tanker Modernization Program. The KC-X Program Office plans to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the KC-X Program not earlier than 23 Feb 2010. This acquisition will be a full and open, best value competition conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15, contracting by Negotiation, as supplemented.<br /><br />
<p>This pre-solicitation notice is not to be construed as a formal solicitation (Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP)). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice. This notice is for information and planning purposes only. The Government will not provide reimbursement of costs associated with any documentation or communication submitted in response to this notice. Any submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. Questions or comments to this notice should be addressed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>This action will result in a fixed-price type contract for EMD of the KC-X system including four (4) developmental aircraft with options for up to 175 production aerial refueling tanker aircraft based on existing commercial aircraft designs; a production rate targeted at 15 aircraft per year is anticipated. Additional options include five years of interim contractor support (in support of the long term goal of standing up a completely organic Government repair capability), spare engines, warranties, wing refueling pod kits and studies. The contractor will ensure the aircraft acquired, including integrated military systems, are certified as flight worthy by the FAA (or foreign equivalent) during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase of the program.</p>
<p>The primary KC-X mission is to provide aerial refueling support to joint and allied forces engaged in homeland defense, global air-bridge deployments, and theater conflicts. The <br />KC-X will also augment existing transport aircraft by providing an enduring cargo capability for materiel, passenger, and medical/humanitarian aid transportation. Key performance capabilities to be provided by the KC-X include: (1) aerial refueling of all current and programmed fixed-wing receiver aircraft including same sortie boom and drogue capability; (2) fuel offload capability at least as good as the KC-135R; (3) the ability to operate anywhere, anytime with global communication, navigation, and air traffic management; (4) airlift capability to carry palletized cargo, passengers, and/or medical patients on the entire main cargo deck; (5) tanker receiver air refueling capability to enhance KC-X fleet effectiveness; (6) operations in chemical and biological environments;<br />(7) network centric information exchange with joint services; (8) survivability features allowing operations closer to the fight including detection and defeat of infrared missiles, situational awareness information, night vision operations, and electro-magnetic pulse protection; and (9) simultaneous multi-point drogue refueling capability.</p>
<p>Proposals will be due not earlier than&nbsp;75 days from the date of RFP release. Exchanges during the source selection process may include clarifications, communications, and discussions as necessary. Contract award is estimated for 4th quarter Government Fiscal Year 2010. The Air Force anticipates a single award but reserves the right to award multiple contracts or, not to award a contract at all.</p>
<p>This competition shall exclude award to a foreign prime contractor based on the required access to restricted information during contract performance.</p>

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) intends to award a sole source contract for the follow-on Government Furnished Equipoment (GFE) production modification of the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS), APG-65 Lot III Reliability Improvement Program Operational Test Program Set (OTPS), G81S00010-3.  NAWCAD is contemplating award to End To End, Inc., Portsmouth, VA as the only source that could supply the modified/upgraded OTPS in time to meet workload requirements. Without this essential repair equipment the F/A-18 will not be able to repair RADAR components that are required to perform the operational mission of the aircraft.  NAWCAD previously awarded a procurement to End to End to upgrade the GFE OTPS to improve the reliability and maintainability and to provide a technical data package representative of the newly designed OTPS.  However, no drawings or data were purchased for the corrections to the original design/configuration nor were any vendor modification instructions delivered that would allow another contractor to modify an existing unit.  End to End has modified 19 units under a previous contract and will be doing so to an additional 35 units under the proposed procurement.  As the orginal equipment manufacturer of the redesign, End to End is considered to be the only source that has the technical data necessary to perform this effort without a costly reverse engineering and/or further redesign.  The Government requires deliveries of the modified units to commence within 60 days after award at a rate of 46 units per month.  The authority for this sole source action is FAR 6.302-1: only one responsible source.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This is not a request for proposals; however, all responses to this notice must be received within 15 days.

Although other manufactures or equipment providers may supply these type(s) of equipment or parts they have not been tested or certified for use in the Mark V Special Operations Craft (SOC); therefore, to ensure operational capability and compatibility with other Mark V components, purchase action must be limited to Detroit Diesel Corp. In accordance with FAR 13.5, a Firm Fixed Price type contract is anticipated.  Delivery will be FOB destination to Naval Amphibious Base, Coronado, San Diego, CA 92155-5003.  NAICS Code 333618 applies. FSC is 2920. SBA Size Standard is 1,000 Employees.  Award will be based on a responsive proposal at a fair and reasonable price.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The proposed contract will assist the Government of Colombia (GOC) to establish of state presence in priority municipalities located in La Macarena (Meta), Southern Tolima, Valle de Cauca, Buenaventura and Southern Choc&oacute; under the National Consolidation Plan (PNC). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Once the GOC has guaranteed a minimum level of permanent security, the CELI contractor will utilize an integrated approach for consolidating peace, security and development gains which will require a robust effort to create thousands of licit economic opportunities, to strengthen and link public and private organizations to promote citizen participation, and to support governance strengthening at the municipal and departmental levels to ensure good governance and improve local service delivery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In transition zones where the GOC has only recently established minimum security, the contractor will emphasize immediate, short-term activities to meet urgent economic and social needs with the goal of demonstrating presence of the state and to help the target areas recover quickly from the effects of the conflict and eradication.&nbsp; Small, quick-impact projects will help to create confidence in the GOC, provide the opportunity to build relations between communities and local government, and respond to local dynamics and urgent needs.&nbsp; In areas where security is better established, the contractor will support longer-term interventions in coordination with the government, private sector and civil society with a particular emphasis on accompaniment and the provision of technical assistance to permanently consolidate state presence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CELI-Central contractor will also coordinate closely with the USAID public policy program and will implement pilot activities in collaboration with the public policy implementer to address policy constraints to consolidation of state presence.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Kevin W Gustin, Contracing Officer, Email kevin.w.gustin@uscg.mil
<DESC>OVERVIEW
The U.S. Coast Guard Academy (CGA) maintains two 50,000 gallon vertical steel tanks to store #6 fuel at the Boiler Plant -- tank ID# AST1 (the southernmost tank) and AST2 (the northernmost tank).  The tanks were installed in 1957 and measure 23' 6" in diameter and 16' 0" in height.  Drawings indicate " steel for the tank bottoms and walls and 3/16" steel on the fixed roofs.  The tanks sit on a bed of sand inside a concrete containment area.  In 1980, the tanks were wrapped in a 2" thick insulation with aluminum sheathing.  An out-of service inspection was conducted on the tanks in 2000.  Ultrasonic measurements of the bottoms did not indicate corrosion at that time.  The record of that inspection includes thickness measurement diagrams and information on pitting, settling, etc.  In August 2005, during an in-service tank inspection, twelve inspection plugs were installed along the base of each tank approximately six inches above the chine to facilitate ultrasonic thickness measurements and a visual inspection of the tank coating.   Average thickness measurements obtained at the inspection plugs was 0.250 inches and the coating system appeared to be in good condition.  Shell settlement measurements determined there was little overall settlement and that out-of-plane deflections were within API-653 limits.

TASKS
Contractor shall provide all labor and equipment necessary to clean and inspect AST1 and AST 2 in accordance with applicable standards set forth in API-653 and all applicable safety regulations.  Tank inspections shall be completed by an API-653 certified inspector.  

Prior to starting, copies of all certifications shall be required, including but not limited to API inspector certification and confined space training certifications.  Contractor shall also submit a Safety Plan for entering and working inside the tanks for CGA review.  Once the certifications are received and the Safety Plan has been approved by CGA, work may commence.

Task 1: Transfer Fuel - Only one tank shall be out of service at any time.
1.1  	CGA will either utilize or transfer fuel from AST2 to AST1 until no more fuel can be drawn.  Contractor shall pump remaining fuel from AST2 into AST1 for the cleaning and inspection of AST2.  Once AST2 cleaning, inspection, and repairs have been completed, CGA will pump fuel from AST1 to AST2 until no more fuel can be drawn.  Contractor shall then pump remaining fuel from AST1 into AST2 for the cleaning and inspection of AST1.  
1.2	Contractor shall remove any remaining sludge for proper disposal prior to cleaning and inspection of each tank.  Contractor shall arrange for the proper disposal of the sludge.  A Government representative will sign ALL manifests.

CGA will be able transfer most of the fuel from one tank to the other with the exception of about 1000 gallons.  The transfer of fuel by CGA will take a minimum of two (2) days.  The remaining amount will need to be transferred from one tank to the other by the contractor.  CGA will attempt to retain the minimum amount of fuel required to operate the boilers to minimize the transfer amounts.

Task 2: Clean the Tanks
2.1	Contractor shall clean the interior of both tanks to a gas-free state.
2.2	Contractor shall arrange for the proper disposal of the oily wastewater and sludge.

Task 3: Inspect the Tanks

The inspector shall draw from API-653, NFPA codes and professional expertise in making the assessment of the tanks.  
3.2	obtain shell settlement elevations. The overall and adjacent settlements will be evaluated against the calculated allowable limit as determined under API-653.
3.3	inspect roof structures and obtain ultrasonic thickness measurements of the roof plates.
3.4	perform a visual inspection of the interior of the tanks according to API-653.
3.5	obtain ultrasonic thickness measurements of bottom and first course shell plates.  Measurements will also be obtained at intervals around the perimeter of the tank.
3.6 	develop a pit depth profile. 
3.7	obtain bottom plate topography measurements.
3.8	measure the relative elevation of the columns.
3.9	test the plate-to-plate seams.  Liquid penetrate test procedures will be performed, if required, on welds that are inaccessible or otherwise suspect.
3.10	perform a detailed inspection of the coating system including a spark test inspection to locate holidays in the coating. The tanks are not known to be coated except for an epoxy coating applied during the 2000 inspection to the tank bottoms and two feet up the side walls.  

Task 4: Identify Necessary Repairs and/or Problems
4.1	The fuel level gauge, float and tape reader is currently broken in AST2.  Contractor shall repair the gauge, float and tape reader in AST2.
4.2	Contractor shall inform the Project Manager immediately if inspection reveals the need to make any other repairs, including the exact nature of the work required in order to return a tank to service.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at the FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for office relocation and furniture reconfiguration services.  The contractor shall perform all of the services required to remove office furniture, equipment, excess material, and related supplies from its present location, transport the property to the designated areas within the new location and place them at the new location.  The contractor shall furnish laborers, trucks and furniture moving equipment (e.g. four wheelers, carts, etc.) to accomplish the work described in the Statement of Work; e.g. excess property pick up, furniture installation/reconfiguration, moving activities, special event activities, furniture cleaning, furniture repair, specialized moving activities and special handling moving activities.
While a contract for these services was awarded in September, 2009, it was determined that the estimated scope of work was not accurately reflected in the schedule of work.  This "re-compete" effort reflects the revised scope of work.  The current contract will be "Terminated for Convenience" of the Government upon award of the new contract.
This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among small businesses.
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to determine "Best Value" to the FAA.  A detailed description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).  All technical submittals should be organized as directed in Section L.
It is anticipated that an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract with Time-and-Material pricing arrangements will be awarded as a result of this SIR/RFO.  It is anticipated that the base period of the new contract will run from April 1, 2010 to September 31, 2010, with option years available on a fiscal year basis for the following four years.    
ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SIR/RFO AND SOW MUST BE RECEIVED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 16, 2010 FOR ANSWERS TO BE PROVIDED BEFORE THE PROPOSALS ARE DUE.
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers, February 25, 2010.  Reference AMS clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  
In addition, all contractors shall complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form with their proposals. The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
Technical and cost proposals must be received by the FAA, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, Thursday, February 25, 2010.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
Hand-delivered responses will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR/RFO could also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for special mail handling procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.
Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the solicitation process.

The offered instrument must meet the following specifications: instrument must have the ability to analyze gas phase species in the atmosphere. The instrument will be used for mainly two projects: first to analyze trace gases in the atmosphere from airborne platforms in various field programs, and second to analyze trace gases in laboratory kinetic experiments.  At a minimum the control and data acquisition system should be able to support addition of a few mass flow controllers and solenoid valves to facilitated varying ion chemistries. The instrument components must be constructed with aviation approved materials that allow for the analysis of gas phase chemical species at ambient atmospheric levels. The complete system must be capable of future modifications and enhancements (in hardware and software). The instrument must have a mass resolution of at least 0.5 amu, and operate over a mass range allowing the analysis of H2O2 by reaction with CO3- or CFO3- reagent ions nominally of 10 to 300 amu.  The instrument must be supplied with a collisional dissociation chamber (CDC), an octopole ion guide, and one 3/8 inch rod dia, quadrupole mass filter with a channeltron detector K+M and an ion molecule reactor. The octopole and quadrupole regions will each be evacuated with at least a 70 l/s turbodrag pump. The CDC should be evacuated with an appropriate vacuum drag pump. All necessary vacuum and roughing pumps and internal tubing will be provided with the instrument.  The CIMS instrument should be mounted in an aluminum instrument rack that is roughly 40 inch wide x 24 inch deep x 36 inch high. The control electronics should also be housed in 19 inch rack mount boxes. A modular design for the control electronics is optimal with an electronics box controlling the quadrupole mass filter to select masses in the range of 10-300 amu. A second electronics box to control the detector and octopole high voltages, high vacuum gauges, and any safety circuits, and the turbopumps is needed. The third box should be capable of controlling up to 8 mass flow controllers and baratrons. The CIMS system must operate as a stand-alone instrument, with the system design sufficiently modern and versatile to allow for an easy network connection. All hardware and software components should be of such a design as to allow for easy upgrade and maintenance. The system should be controlled by a laptop computer equipped with the necessary data acquisition boards to control the CIMS instruments, and record all relevant pressures, flows, temperatures, and valve states etc. Computer and Software: A computer for instrument control, data acquisition and data analysis. The software must be capable of controlling the CIMS and additional pressure mass flow controllers, and several solenoid valves from the same data station and provide complete system control. The software should be capable of allowing the complete hands-free optimization, ion lenses, reaction gas flow rates, mass calibration resolution and detector calibration on the instrument. One year warranty from date of acceptance applies under NAVSUP clause 5252.246-9401. This notice of intent is a request for competitive quotations. A solicitation will be issued by 12 February 2010.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The University of Idaho, Kimberly R&E Center, 3793 North 3600 East, Kimberly ID 83341-5076.  The University of Idaho to provide satellite-based maps of evapotranspiration (ET) from Landsat satellite images for the Landsat Path/Row 39/28. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy the agency's requirement. 
The satellite-based maps of evapotranspiration (ET) from Landsat satellite images for the Landsat Path/Row 39/28 covering the Smith River watershed of Montana and to integrate these images into maps showing monthly and growing season ET.  Eight Landsat images will be processed for dates to be determined by the contractor and USGS for a specified year of coverage.
The processing will use Level 1T terrain-corrected Landsat images for the study area that are freely downloadable from the USGS EROS data site.  The proposed work will include the calculation of reference evapotranspiration (ETr) on a daily basis for a minimum of one weather station within the 39/28 path/row for the period of analysis.  The ETr will be computed using the ASCE Penman-Monteith reference method applied to USBR Agrimet or other RAWS stations in the region and/or using weather data collected locally by the USGS.  
On average, one Landsat 5 satellite image will be processed for each month of the growing season.  If potential Landsat 5 images within any six week period are clouded over, Landsat 7 images will be processed in their place (Landsat 7 has a broken scan line corrector so that stripes of missing data exist in parts of images that must be 'gapfilled' following the determination of ET). 
Deliverables include the following:
1. Processing and production of ET images for Landsat path 39, row 28 on a monthly basis over the course of a growing season of a year during the 2000-2009 period having a relatively cloud-free image set over the Smith River portion of the image.2. Assembly of hourly data from USBR Agrimet stations, Remote Automated Weather Stations (RAWS), and National Weather Service stations.  Provision of quality assessment and control of those weather data over the period of satellite analyses.3. Hourly and daily reference ETr for the study area for the period of analysis.4. Production of ET images at 30-m resolution from Landsat.5. Cloud masking and filling of clouded areas of images and gap filling scanline-corrector-off gaps for any Landsat images processed.6. Integration of processed ET images to develop ET maps by month and growing season.7. Quarterly Status Reports and Final Report describing the processing of Landsat images and summarizing results.8. Transfer of all raw satellite images and final ET products to USGS at any time, upon request, and at the termination of the contract.9. Advise USGS on application of generated ET products in water balance analyses.10. Delineation of evapotranspiration rate per crop type.11. Travel to Helena at the end of the project to describe and review the final data products.
Firms who feel that they can furnish the required products/services described above and provide considerable cost sharing are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar products/services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the products/services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification to Dave Sudduth, Contract Specialist, Fort Collins Science Center (FORT), Fort Collins, CO, 80526,  phone number 970-226-9289,  within 10 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, FORT, is conducting a study of the bighorn sheep herd on the eastside of Rocky Mountain National Park. We seek to develop a non-invasive method to count the animals using the fecal DNA, in order to avoid the use of helicopters or physically marking and handling animals.  In order to identify the individual bighorns that use the park, we need to be able to identify individual sheep by their feces, by extracting DNA and developing markers at multiple loci.  Then Mark-Resight analysis can be conducted to determine the population size.
Vendor shall use DNA extraction methods and microsatellite typing procedures (Maudet et al. 2004) for 9 neutral microsatellite DNA markers and 6 microsatellites in genes of known function, as was successfully used by Luikart et al. (2006) for the eastside bighorn sheep herd. Some of these genes are associated with immune system function. Genotyping errors are expected when using DNA from non-invasive samples (feces) due to the low quality and low amounts of DNA recoverable from these types of samples (Luikart et al 2006). Therefore, vendor shall repeat genotyping each sample DNA extract 3 times for each of 6 microsatellite loci.  
Based on the information at this time, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from the Wildlife and Conservation Genetics Specialists operated by Dr. Gordon Luikart,4201 South Avenue West, Missoula, MT., and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.

<DESC><strong>Request for Information</strong><br /><br />Today's Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) satellite control architecture provides satellite mission communications, state-of-health, mission assurance and interoperability support for many missions and all phases of space system operations (routine, responsive, test and evaluation, launch, early orbit, anomaly, disposal). The satellite communication infrastructure currently uses a number of world-wide systems to provide communications, tracking, telemetry and commanding.
<p>Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Directorate of Development Planning (XR) is defining options for the next-generation SATOPS enterprise architecture. The purpose of this RFI is to capture potential SATOPS concepts that leverage current and future-planned systems and meet the intent of the AFSPC/CC-directed SATOPS Enterprise Architecture Transformation. The future SATOPS architecture must consolidate current functions and capabilities, reduce duplication and improve interoperability at all levels. Reference SATOPS AFSPC/CC letter dated 23 Dec 2008 (available upon request). Examples of systems under consideration to facilitate this transformation include the current AFSCN, GPS, WGS, AEHF, NPOESS, space based networks, space surveillance networks and collision avoidance systems. The new SATOPS architecture should also provide improved space situational awareness (SSA), defensive space control and operationally response space capabilities, enabling AFSPC to meet National Security Space objectives and Joint warfighter operational needs.</p>
<p>Respondents are welcome to quantify how their potential architecture concept solution enables enterprise management, leverages data fusion/information sharing for time critical SSA/C2 applications, increases operational efficiency, lowers operational costs, and provides cost effective capability based effects. If available, include your insight into technology and architecture roadmaps showing the evolution strategy, implementation approach, and migration path from the current architecture to future architecture. Please group concepts into the following time epochs: Near-Term (0-5 years), Mid-Term (5-15 years), and Far-Term (15-30+) years.</p>
<p>SMC/XR has released two RFIs, one requesting future concepts for the next-generation Launch and Test Range System (LTRS) and the other for next-generation Satellite Operations (SATOPS). Respondents choosing to provide submissions to both RFIs are asked to identify where there are elements common to both.<br /><br /><strong>Response Information</strong></p>
<p>This RFI is being conducted for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a request for proposal or a request for quote. Information contained in this RFI is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with a submission in response. The information received will be considered for the purposes of market research.</p>
<p>This RFI is unrestricted and encourages responses from all responsible contractors independent of size. Additionally, responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions. The appropriate NAICS and size standard for this RFI is 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology) and 1,000, respectively.</p>
<p>All responses should be accomplished on company letterhead and limited to 30 pages. Page size shall be 8.5 x 11 inches, single-spaced with text no smaller than 11-point font size, Times New Roman. Margins shall be one-inch on all sides. <br /><br />All responses and any technical inquiries should be submitted electronically to Capt Alan Lin (Project Officer). Unclassified responses should also include a cc copy to Mr. Keith Newton. Please contact Capt Lin for your preferred method of classified response delivery. Company proprietary material should be properly marked. <br /><br />SMC/XR plans to create a small team to review your RFI response. The government led team will include Aerospace (FFRDC) and local System Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contractors assigned to XR and the wings. If you feel your RFI response requires you have a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) from any of the review team members, please be sure to include the necessary agreement forms and instructions 10 days prior (15 Mar) to your RFI submittal.<br /><br /><strong>Technical Points of Contact</strong></p>

<DESC><strong>Request for Information<br /></strong><br />The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Directorate of Development Planning (XR) is defining options for next-generation Launch and Test Range System (LTRS) control architecture and operations. The goal of this RFI is to capture concepts that leverage current and planned systems and reduce the current launch and test range infrastructure. Examples of systems under consideration include the current launch and range architecture, GPS, AFSCN, MILSATCOM, SBIRS and commercial systems. Benefits of this approach may include reduced sustainment costs, higher data rates and throughput, increased efficiency and added schedule flexibility.
<p>The Launch and Test Range System "must haves" are: (1) ensures safe passage and protects the public as launch vehicles transit to and from space; (2) provides clearance to launch/land and monitor operations to stay within prescribed flight envelopes; (3) collects vehicle performance data for post-flight analysis to determine vehicle readiness for next mission; and (4) supports responsive launch, routine launch, and test and evaluation activities." Source: AFSPC CAA Report Dec 09.</p>
<p>The east and west coast range infrastructure currently uses a number of systems to provide tracking, telemetry, commanding, launch area surveillance, weather and communications. The government assumes the launch range architecture includes GPS metric tracking, autonomous flight safety systems, improved network communication backbone, a streamlined and secure ground infrastructure. More detail is available from AFSPC/CC's Launch and range Enterprise Transformation (LET) plan and its implementation timeline of 2010-2018.</p>
<p>Describe how your potential concepts would evolve from this architecture and provide an increased adaptability to support DOD, commercial, civil and foreign launches. How would the radar, telemetry and communication infrastructure continue to change? How would the architecture support increased physical and cyber security? The migration to Autonomous Flight Safety System will significantly change routine launch monitoring and system safety; how could the future architecture address test and evaluation requirements? What post LET technologies should be employed to further improve range effectiveness and efficiency, to include on-board and off board system monitoring? How would the system perform debris tracking? We also welcome comparisons to how other countries support their launch needs and what trends are appearing.</p>
<p>We're interested in architectures that provide equivalent capabilities to the government proposed (LET) architecture, at lower life cycle cost. Architectures that meet currently unmet requirements can be associated with cost increases, but should result in lower costs than other methods of meeting the same requirements.</p>
<p>SMC/XR is performing the Conventional Strike Missile demonstration program; this RFI is also interested in gathering information on the trade between adapting the current range architecture to meet anticipated Prompt Global Strike (PGS) requirements versus fielding a tailored PGS range system. The trade might address how the current range could expand to meet the anticipated quick reaction needs of PGS or how a new infrastructure could be adopted that would be tailored to meet the emerging PGS needs as they evolve.</p>
<p>Information gathered from this request is intended to help the XR program office create development plans that sponsor advanced technology development, conduct concept/technologies demonstrations or spawn in-depth concept development and maturation from competitively awarded contracts.</p>
<p>SMC/XR has released two RFIs, one requesting future concepts for the next-generation Launch and Test Range System (LTRS) and the other for next-generation Satellite Operations (SATOPS).

<DESC>Contract No. 70181AM093
TAS:14 16620000
United States Department of the InteriorJustification of Other than Full and Open Competition Under $25,000
1) Briefly, a description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs and include the estimated value.AV videoconferencing services for the Leadership Conference at the Downtown Anchorage Hilton Hotel during February 8-12, 2010.
2)  Statutory Authority  permitting other than full and open competition.  Identify the statutory authority permitting with the FAR citation and FAR citation Title.  FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
3) WHY are the proposed contractor's unique qualifications for the nature of the acquisition requiring the use of the authority cited in item (2). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has previously contracted with the Downtown Anchorage Hilton Hotel to provide the space and refreshments for its Leadership Conference being held February 8-12, 2010. Originally, the hotel stated it would be able to accommodate our request to host video conferences without additional A/V equipment services. Our telecommunications specialists went to the hotel the week before the conference to test the equipment, only to find a dedicated internet service line was required, as well as additional screens and speakers to ensure a quality videoconference was able to be held with secured internet protocols. As a result, the hotel requires agencies use the hotel's contract with GCI for the A/V services. No other firm is allowed to provide these services within the Hilton Hotel.
4) WHAT effort was made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practical.  Given that the hotel requires only GCI perform the necessary services to make videoconferencing possible, the contract must be made with GCI or the Hilton Hotel. Our telecommunications staff looked into creating a contract directly with GCI to avoid any unnecessary fees from the hotel and any mark-ups. According to the research, the same services and equipment would cost double by going through GCI instead of the hotel, because GCI requires 1 month worth of dedicated internet service, while the hotel has an agreement to provide the service on a daily basis. Furthermore, GCI refused to provide the services separately from the Hilton Hotel.
5) A Description of the Market survey conducted and the results. The conference space was originally competed amongst the local downtown Anchorage hotels. In the end, only the Hilton has the necessary space to accommodate 150-200 attendants. As the original order did not call for A/V equipment and services, we cannot change the venue, and contracting for the services through the hotel is more cost effective, all steps to remove or overcome barriers to competition have been taken.

<DESC>Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center (AATC), in conjunction with the Air National Guard Bureau (NGB) NGB/A5, will host an RC-26 Modernization Program requirements symposium. This symposium will include open-forum briefings to industry intended to make available to industry upcoming RC-26 modernization/upgrade system requirements and survey industry capabilities.<BR><BR>The RC-26 Modernizations Program and related briefings has been divided into three subcategories representing the major subsystems to be upgraded: avionics modernization, Adaptable Communications and Mission System Operator Station (MSO). The requirements symposium will held on March 2nd and 3rd, 2010 at the AATC facility in Tucson, Arizona.  The requirements symposium registration will commence at 8:00am followed by the RC-26 Avionics Modernization briefing. The Adaptable Communications and MSO Station upgrade briefings will be held on March 3rd. Registration for these briefing will commence at 8:00am followed by the RC-26 Adaptable Communications and MSO Station upgrade briefings in turn.  There will be a question & answer open forum session after each briefing. All briefings will be held at the AATC Test Center building 10.  Be advised it is probable recommended solutions will be flown in a formal test environment.  Final upgrade determination will be made by the RC-26 Contractor Logistics Support prime contractor  Lear Siegler (LSI).<BR><BR>The C-26B/RC-26B is a militarized version of the FAA-type certificated Fairchild SA227-DC aircraft.  The current fleet consists of 11 aircraft assigned to the Air National Guard (ANG).  The ANG RC-26B aircraft are modified as Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) support aircraft carrying specialized electronic equipment to provide aerial surveillance and reconnaissance for a wide range of domestic and OCONUS missions.  <BR><BR>The RC-26B avionics, communications, and MSO suite(s) are becoming obsolete and unsustainable due to parts out of production, diminishing availability of replacements or parts no longer serviced or serviceable.  Furthermore, these subsystems require modernization in order to take advantage of emerging technology in support of operational mission needs. The basic focus of avionics modernization includes the Global Positioning System (GPS) Antenna, Autopilot #1 T-Bar Relay, Autopilot #2 T-Bar Relay, Electronic Flight Information System (EFIS) 10 Display, Radio Altimeter, Pilots Altimeter, KNS 660 Flight Management System (FMS), and KLN 670 GPS.  The RC-26B does not have FM immunity on any of its navigation radios.  A minimum of one Instrument Landing System (ILS), one VHF Omni-Directional Radio-Range (VOR), and Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) receiver is required to be FM immune.  A new FMS will reduce pilot workload, enhance safety, and make the RC-26 Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) compliant.  Replacement of these parts will ensure the RC-26B is compliant with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandates and can continue to operate in US and European (worldwide) airspace.  FM Immunity is required to ensure safe operation of aircraft when flying terminal area approaches to prevent a mishap and possible Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT). <BR><BR>Adaptable Communications upgrade consideration should include Beyond Line-of-sight (BLOS) broadband satellite communication capability, Situation Awareness Display Link (SADL), ARC-231 and PRC-117/117G for both InmarSaT/SAT and line of sight.  Future tactical radios must be able to integrate into the existing ICS system and full spectrum capability for seamless communication with any/all Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) or civil disaster response radio network is desired.  Other capabilities include communications bridging or relay, multiple R/Ts for frequency communication and must capable of any encryption. It shall be capable of integrating any hand held radio type with power and full integration with the current ICS system, two such outlets for handheld radio sets and tunable antenna capability. Communications suite radios should be interchangeable with adaptable plugs and rack mounting so that different radio suites can be interchanged for any mission set and be capable of quick plug and play capability for future communication or signal technologies and should include Satellite and cell telephone call/receive capability. <BR><BR>MSO system requirements include robust non-proprietary software that can be adaptable to future integration of sensor or communications technologies and be compatible with current or multiple sensor(s). Station focus shall include ergonomic considerations and directed toward Sensor technology advancement, system integration and compatibility with Operational Mission requirements.  Additional detailed systems requirements will be presented during the Requirements Symposium.<BR><BR>REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Participants must register NLT 12:00pm MST, March 1, 2010 by contacting the primary POC: John Williams, john.williams.12@aztucs.ang.af.mil, 520-295-6915.<BR>Include company name, attendee name(s), company email, company website, and phone number.<BR>There is no registration fee for attending this conference.<BR>Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 40 registrants on a first-register, first-served basis, and no more than three (3) representatives per organization.<BR>Walks-ins will not be accommodated.<BR>This Industry Day will be unclassified and open to the general public.<BR>All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.<BR>Point of Contact(s):<BR>Primary/Registration - John Williams,<BR>john.williams.12@aztucs.ang.af.mil, 520-295-6915<BR>Contracting  SMSgt Jon D.

<DESC>PER FAR 5.2 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATINAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Mobile District has a requirement to upgrade equipment and software associated with the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems for eleven Hydropower plants within the USACE South Atlantic Division. The work will consist of determining what custom applications on the existing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system need to be updated to function with IFix 5.0, provide the updated versions, upgrade existing Scipar Applications with latest code improvements, and provide remote technical support to Government personnel performing installation, setup, and configuration task in the field. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Scipar Inc, 26 West Spring St, NY 14221, under authority of FAR 6.302.  The contract to install the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems at the eleven hydropower plants was originally competed and awarded to Scipar Inc. Scipar Inc. originally installed custom applications and software that are proprietary and licensed for USACE use only.  Therefore, the Government intends for it to be sole sourced to Scipar Inc. since they are capable of interfacing the updated versions of the software with the existing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system.  It is anticipated that a fixed Price contract will be awarded.  The (NAICS) code is 541519 and size standard is $25.0 Mil.<BR><BR>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  All responses received within 15 calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All questions should be sent by email to Geanette Kelley, at geanette.kelley@usace.army.mil.  <BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(10), with BIOQUAL, Inc. to purchase nonhuman primates that were previously used in an active chemical agent protection study. The non human primates are required by the US Army Med Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) for ongoing and future studies. These animals are being requested from BIOQUAL a company that performs immunological and infectious disease research involving small animals and nonhuman primate models.  Bioqual, Inc. is uniquely qualified to meet the Governments need for this particular group of nonhuman primates due to the animals already having been used in an active chemical agent protection study approved at USAMRICD. The date for the animals to be delivered to USAMRICD is March 15, 2010. No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by  February 15, 2010 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement.<BR><BR>

The monitors are connected to the patient via a reusable 5 lead cable system and "stuck" to the patient using simple electrodes. Patient monitor data is recorded via a reading station. Patient monitors are simply connected to the reading station and their data transferred once the patient returns the monitor. Total equipment requirements are: 1 reading station, 1 interface component usually included with the reading station to enable communication between reading station and patient monitors, 10 monitors with at least 3 having 48 hour recording capability, and 10 reusable 5 lead ECG wires.</p>
<p>Capabilities: a system that can take data from a patient monitor, organize it into a user friendly format, and interpret the data to identify abnormal cardiac rhythms. The reading station must be able to automatically label patient ECG rhythms by category. (i.e. tell the technician if a beat is normal or abnormal) The system must be able to record at least 3 channels for viewing by the technicians during analysis. It must also be able to analyze chronic arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The reading system must be able to generate reports which summarize all patient data so Cardiologists can diagnose patient disorders.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

 EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS
General Instructions
Quotations shall be prepared in accordance with and comply with the instructions in this document.  The technical submission will be evaluated separately from the price.  Each submission will be evaluated against the evaluation factors listed below. In addition, a Project Management Plan (PMP) should be included with the quotation.   Basis for Award
Award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical and all other evaluation factors, and price considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable price.  Technical and other evaluation factors are more important than price.  However, between submission that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, price will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror.
The Government reserves the right not to make an award as a result of this competition, if in the opinion of the Government none of the submissions would provide satisfactory performance at a cost that is considered fair and reasonable and/or economically feasible.
EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
The following evaluation criteria will be utilized in order to determine which Offeror is considered to be the best overall value.  Factors 1.4.1, 1.4.2, and 1.4.3 are roughly equal to each other; factor 1.4.4 is less important. Sub-factors listed are of equal importance to each other.
1.4.1	UNDERSTANDING, PLANNING AND TECHNICAL APPROACH
A.	Fully understands the subject matter (AMAG products in particular) and demonstrates the ability to design and execute a reasonable strategy to perform the maintenance of the current system in place at MMS sites;
B.	Demonstrate the ability to implement technology to comply with Personal Identity Verification (PIV) II standards as set forth in Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12 and Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 201; and
C.	Understands the scope, importance and objectives of the project required by the MMS and is aware of potential problems that may occur and demonstrates the ability to resolve them;  and
D.  Quality and effectiveness of the contractor approach to security issues that will produce useful information for decision making purposes for MMS.
1.4.2	PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN (PMP)
A.	The contractor is an AMAG certified contractor and;
B.	The relevant expertise of the Project Manager and key personnel in their disciplines and ability to successfully complete this project and any maintenance or repairs within the timeframe allotted; and 
C.	Evidence that there will be committed Project Manager with management experience and AMAG certified with resources/knowledge to complete any projects in a successful and timely manner; and
D.	The Project Management Plan should provide evidence that the contractor currently holds a Tier One Reentry Placard for Jefferson Parish.  Vendor must also be able to ensure MMS that they will be available immediately after a declared disaster.  MMS will require that the contractor be available to reenter and evaluate MMS damage and perform remedial repairs as soon as possible to ensure that MMS data and equipment is secured.  MMS must be assured that they will be a top priority to the contractor.  
1.4.3	Past Performance/Past Experience
Past performance is the Governments assessment of the degree to which an offeror has satisfied its past customers.  MMS may review the Past Performance Retrieval System (PPIRS) at PPIRS.GOV, for any reported performance reports and any other sources deemed relevant.  MMS may also contact some or all of the customers listed as Past Performance references in the contractors proposal.  MMS may ask questions such as: whether or not they believe (1) that the Offeror was capable, timely, efficient, and effective; (2) that the offerors performance conformed to the terms and conditions of their contract; (3) that the Offeror was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; (4) that the Offeror was committed to customer satisfaction; and (5) whether the work performed by the contractor was similar and relevant to the work required by MMS under this RFQ, and (6) whether the services provided by the Contractor were of  a high quality.  MMS would like contractors to provide evidence that they have performed remedial maintenance, repairs, installation and software assistance to other customers.  Past experience is the experience that offerors have performing work that is the same or similar to the work required by the MMS under this RFQ.  Both past performance and past experience may be evaluated by utilizing the information provided by the offeror.  
1.4.4	Price
The Government will evaluate the quoted price for reasonableness by various methods.  Quotes for maintenance should be on a monthly basis through September 30, 2010.  Hourly labor rate for work outside normal hours of operation should also be included in the quote. 
The price quote will be evaluated separately from the technical proposal.  Evaluators will consider whether the quoted price adequately reflects an understanding of the project.
Offerors are placed on notice that any quotes which are unrealistic in terms of technical approach or unrealistically low in cost(s) and/or price may be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competency or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity of the requirements and may be grounds for the rejection of the submission.
The Offeror is expected to quote a reasonable price.  An evaluation of each Offerors price quote will be made to determine if it is reasonable for the work to be performed, reflects a clear understanding of the requirements, and is consistent with the technical proposed solution.
Each price quote will be assessed to identify potential risk.  Cost/price risk refers to any aspect of an Offerors quote which could have significant negative cost/price consequences for the Government.  Where risk is assessed it may be described in qualitative terms or used as a best-value discriminator.

<DESC>Question Received :<br /><br />I will need to know the exact requirements for excitation and emission for both sets of filters. <br /><br />Example: Excitation + Emission #1 need to be &nbsp;EX 340+/- 30nm + EM 450 +/-25nm <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Excitation + Emission #2 need to be EX 300-370nm + EM 400-475nm <br /><br />Your RFQ lists only approximate ranges for both filter sets. &nbsp;Can you provide clarification? <br /><br />Reply:&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">An instrument that meets the EPA's minimum requirements&nbsp;shall have filter combinations to measure fluorescence at 2 different portions of a CDOM Excitation Emission Matrix. This means there should be no overlap of emission wavelengths, including filter bandpasses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An example :</p>
<p dir="ltr">emission filter 1 = 420 nm +/- 20 nm bandpass</p>
<p dir="ltr">emission filter 2 = 470 nm +/- 20 nm bandpass</p>
<p dir="ltr">The excitation filters shall be selected between Exc = 300-370 nm, where, either one or two different wavelengths could be chosen. Two combination examples could be:</p>
<p dir="ltr">(1) Ex/Em 1 = 350 / 420 nm; Ex/Em 2 = 370 / 470 nm</p>
<p dir="ltr">(2) Ex/Em 1 = 350 / 420 nm; Ex/Em 2 = 350 / 470 mn</p>
<p dir="ltr">The choice of filters, in conjunction with lamp and detector design of a specific manufacturer should be based on optimizing CDOM fluorescence detection in natural waters.</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO. This announcement does not relieve the potential offerors from the previous request for submitting the capabilities statements on or before the 16 May deadline.This is not a request for proposal and no response is required.    The PCO shall be the sole POC for any and all communication regarding this acquisition: Kimberly Henderson, (937) 255-7682, email kimberly.henderson@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services (WS) is seeking interested parties capable of manufacturing GonaCon Immunocontraceptive Vaccine. Manufacturing must be conducted under Good Laboratory Practices, Good Manufacturing Practices or similar ISO certifications. Manufacturing would be required at a minimum of twice per year.
<p><br /><br />The GonaConTM Immunocontraceptive Vaccine formulation consists of a multi-step process where mammalian Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) is conjugated to a mollusk hemocyanin and emulsified in a mineral oil based adjuvant to form the final product (Figure 1). Prior to conjugation the hemocyanin carrier protein must be maleimide activated. Dialysis is performed to remove excess maleimide formed after the activation. GnRH is then conjugated to the maleimide activated hemocyanin. The aduvant is formulated separately from the rest of the vaccine by preparing a suspension of killed bacteria in light mineral oil. Final preparation of the vaccine involves vortex mixing the peptide/hemocyanin conjugate with the adjuvant preparation and producing the final emulsion by running the preparation through an emulsifier. The final emulsion is loaded into 3 ml polyethylene syringes. Individual syringes are then labeled, packaged and shipped to a predetermined USDA facility. All phases of manufacturing must be conducted under clean room conditions. Specialized equipment requirements include a spectrophotometer for quality assurance monitoring, and a emulsification instrument capable of producing 6000 psi (e.g., Microfluidics Model M110L or equivalent).<br /><br /><br />A process demonstration may occur at Fort Collins, CO.&nbsp; If this happens the information will be posted with this annoucement.<br /><br />A question and answer document has been posted.</p>

<CONTACT>BRIAN R ROSE, Contract Specialist, Phone 717 770-4673, Email brian.rose@dla.mil - MEDARD R KOWALSKI, CONTRACTING OFFICER, Phone 717 770-5979, Fax 717 770-5689, Email medard.kowalski@dla.mil
<DESC>The Defense Distribution Center (DDC) has a requirement to provide distribution labor services for temporary, intermittent support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and DDC mission.  The type of services include planning, program management, executing effective and efficient receiving, storage, physical inventory, packaging, care of supplies in storage (COSIS), stock control, stock selection, issue processing, packing, shipping, traffic management support, distribution of material, container fabrication, material processing center (MPC) functions, consolidation and containerization functions, ocean terminal operations, and kitting.  

A contract is required to support excess workload due to surge and Government labor shortages in order to avoid any degradation to the DDC/DLA mission.  Urgency and termination issues are sometimes difficult to address as they relate to temporary hiring of Government employees and the bureaucracy and governing labor regulations.  A contract for labor to support workload surges and distribution contingency operations on an as needed  basis would provide for a stop-gap measure for unforeseen, unplanned, situations that the DDCs current workforce cannot absorb with regular work, overtime, reassignment, or temporary or permanent hiring actions.  This contract will provide labor to support workload surges, unforeseen/unplanned workload, contingency operations and special projects in DLA/DDC locations across the Continental United States (CONUS) and Hawaii.  

The DDC is seeking offerors to perform the above functions which will be evaluated utilizing a Lowest Price / Technically Acceptable source selection procedure. This procurement will be set-aside for a contractor qualified in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, using competitive procedures.  DDC released a DRAFT solicitation on 14 January 2010 and anticipates the final solicitation will be released on or about 22 February 2010. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will result in a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with cost reimbursement (no fee) contract line items.  The labor will be accomplished under the CPFF portion while materials and support costs as well as travel/training/conference costs will be reimbursed under the cost reimbursement (no fee) portion.  The Government intends to issue a single award from the solicitation.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to be a one-year base period and four one-year options. 

A pre-proposal conference is expected to be conducted at DDC.  Time and locations will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website. 

The NAICS Code and Size Standard are: 493110 and $25.5 million, respectively. 

All documents to this solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://wwww.fedbizopps.gov/) under solicitation SP3300-10-R-0009.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1: Presolicitation / Advance Planning Notice for Informational Purposes Only
PR#: N00421-09-R-0119

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL


Clarification: The following clarification is offered regarding the NAICS code identified for the APF requirement and further information is provided in regard to Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI).

NAICS Clarification: A Sources Sought for the APF requirement was previously posted via FedBizOpps. Sources Sought N00421-09-R-0119 dated June 30, 2009 for the Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentation's (AVMIs) Aircraft Prototype Systems Division (APSD) Aircraft Prototype Facility (APF) support at Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD identified NAICS code 541712 and listed a size standard of 500 employees. The size standard of 500 employees was mistakenly listed, the size standard, as applicable to the APF requirement, is 1000 employees for NAICS code 541712. Furthermore, the NAICS code for this requirement has changed. After further review, the optimal NAICS code for this requirement is 336413. The size standard for NAICS code 336413 is 1000 employees.  It is noted that the sources sought process is a market research tool used only for making an appropriate set-aside determination (if any) for a specific procurement. This requirement remains a 100% small business set aside. 

It is noted that the size standard, as applicable to the APF requirement, is 1000 employees for NAICS code 541712 and the size standard for revised NAICS code 336413 is 1000 employees. Thus, the revised NAICS code will not act to further limit competition when compared to the previously synopsis NAICS code. A Bidder may submit a proposal for this requirement regardless of the NAICS code that the company is registered under, if the Bidder satisfies the set-aside grouping (100% small business for this requirement) and the Bidder meets the size standard for NAICS code 336413. 

OCI Clarification: In accordance with 5252.209-9510 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (NAVAIR) (SERVICES)(OCT 2005) potential bidders are advised:  To the extent the contractor provides systems engineering and/or technical direction for a system or commodity but does not have overall contractual responsibility for the development, the integration, assembly and checkout (IAC) or the production of the system, the contractor shall not (i) be awarded a contract to supply the system or any of its major components or (ii) be a subcontractor or consultant to a supplier of the system or of its major components.  The contractor agrees that it will not supply to the Department of Defense (either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor) or act as consultant to a supplier of, any system, subsystem, or major component utilized for or in connection with any item or other matter that is (directly or indirectly) the subject of the systems engineering and/or technical direction or other services performed under this contract for a period of 3 years after the date of completion of the contract.    (FAR 9.505-1(a))

NOTE: The above information is only to be construed as further clarification and does not supersede any direction given via the solicitation, once issued, for the APF requirement. 

Scope: The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) anticipates a requirement for Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) supplies and incidental services to support the Aircraft Prototype Systems Division, Code 5.2.8, which operates under the umbrella of the Range Departments Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentation (AVMI) Department. Contractor support is required for the Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentations (AVMIs) Aircraft Prototype Systems Division (APSD) Aircraft Prototype Facility (APF) and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD) prototype programs. The APF consists of a small standing Government staff to support a wide variety of transient customers. The APF is designed to house a diversity of projects, requiring security protection beginning at GENSER Secret and ranging upward to Top Secret. Platforms will include, but are not limited to F/A-18, E-2, V-22, EA-6B, Unstaffed Air Vehicles of many varieties, and the MH-60 R/S. The concept of operations for the APSD, supported by the APF is as follows: Upon receipt of a work order or tasking, the APSD will form focused, government lead and directed teams to support customer requirements, with the typical product being a prototype, validation and verification system or unit, with a set of engineering drawings and data sufficient to perform large quantity replication of the system or unit. To meet critical fleet needs, APSD will often be called upon to produce limited supplies of such systems or units to fill the need while larger production contracts (outside of the scope of this contract) are put into place. See attached draft Statement of Work for further information. The resulting contract vehicle will be a Cost-Plus-fixed-Fee (CPFF)/Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The estimated period of performance is 5 years. 

Incumbent: This is a new requirement. 

Set-Aside: 
100% Small Business Set-Aside

Contract Type:
An IDIQ contract is planned as a contract inclusive of CPFF and FFP CLINs. NAICS code is 336413.

Attachments:
Draft Statement of Work - The Draft Statement of Work has been reformatted for clarification purposes.

Milestones:
NAVAIR anticipates procurement milestones to occur on or around the following dates.
Solicitation Issued: 03 March 2010

<DESC>COMMAND AIR CREW TRAINING (CACT) PROGRAM FOR ACADEMIC AND SIMULATOR TRAINING ON THE C-40A AIRCRAFT
PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE

NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division has a requirement to support the Navy's Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) Program.  The following training courses are required:   C-40A Maintenance Training: Standard Course, C-40A Mobile Maintenance Training: Standard Course, and C-40A Aircraft Rigging Maintenance Training. This effort includes providing all labor, equipment, training facilities (excluding mobile course facilities as noted below), tools, training materials, training devices, administration, supervision and other services necessary for training for maintenance personnel of the Navy's C-40A (Boeing 737-700C Increased Gross Weight (IGW) configured for the U.S. Navy).  Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.  Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein. The Navy must approve all course-training syllabi (Approved Training Syllabus (ATS)). The contractor will be required to submit a training syllabus for each course for government approval. 
 The C-40A Maintenance Training Standard Course is a combined Airframe, Power plant, Avionics, and Electrical training course. The C-40A Mobile Maintenance Training Standard Course is the mobile version of this course which will be conducted at a Government provided site. These courses shall provide practical training and repair application on general aircraft systems with focus on C-40A (Boeing 737-700C IGW) airframe, power plant systems, electrical /avionics systems. Trainees completing this training course(s) shall have reviewed all areas relative to the C-40As (Boeing 737-700C IGW) airframe, power plant systems, electrical, and avionics systems with emphasis in trouble shooting/test, removal, and adjustment/replacement/repair at a component level. Trainees must pass a final exam.  The C-40A Maintenance Training course shall be capable of meeting ATA Specification 104 Level II or higher criteria. The Mobile version of this course will be conducted at a Government provided facility. Instructors shall have an Airframe and Power Plant (A&P) License and demonstrated, practical knowledge and experience in the Boeing 737 next generation (NG) aircraft.  The A&P may be waived in cases where demonstrated, practical experience is extensive.  The contractor shall provide for all courses actual or mock components (avionics, engines, engine components, etc.) in order to provide real-life hands-on training,  a Systems Familiarization Trainer/(SFT-low cost mockup) or equivalent higher order training device depicting cockpit and/or aircraft systems for trainee's to practice systems checks, identify equipment, observe aircraft system operations and review checklists.  The contractor shall provide for courses, where identified, a Maintenance Systems Training Device (MSTD) that depicts specific applications and/or aircraft systems (e.g., avionics, electrical).  The MSTD training device shall be an interactive trainer capable of student input and trainer system indications/ responses (action-reaction capability).  Maintenance Systems Training Device(s) (not a visual or motion simulator) training periods shall minimally include applicable safety and maintenance systems checks compliant to course ATA 104 level requirements.  Use of aircraft full flight simulators (used in training pilots) is not desired if use causes added cost value to the contract. Trainees must pass a course final exam.  

Training Locations:  Courses taught at a Contractor training site must be within 30 minutes of commercial lodging and eating establishments.  Training shall take place in an environmentally conducive, contractor facility for learning.  Additionally, upon request, Navy directed maintenance training shall be conducted at a Government specified site (mobile).  The Navy will provide an environmentally conducive classroom, chalk/marker board, projector screen, VCR and overhead projector for mobile maintenance courses.  Government site (mobile) maintenance course locations will be determined at the time of the requirement.  All training sites will be within the continent of the United States (not Hawaii or Alaska) and may be for one or more maintenance courses per trip.  Training device requirements for government site (mobile) courses shall be performed in a Navy provided C-40A aircraft or waived as a requirement.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Alutiiq Global Solutions LLC; W911S2-06-D-0006-0096<br><br>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because this is an order under an existing contract that was awarded using non-competitive procedures.<br><br>The Directorate of Contracting issued a change order to add rock coring, fracturing and excavation to the scope of work for this project. The contractor encountered rock upon excavating the earth for the traffic signal pole foundations. The rock was an unknown physical condition at the site, of an unusual nature which differs materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in work of the character provided for in the contract. These conditions caused an increase in the contractors cost of performing work under this task order, and an equitable adjustment was made under FAR 52.236-2, Differing Site Conditions, in the amount of $13,244.65. Furthermore, due to the additional work required, the contract completion date was extended from 17 January 2010 to 01 May 2010. All other terms and conditions of said task order remain unchanged. The project was funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION. For Informational Purposes Only. This action is awarded under Modification no. A111 that recognizes Work Authorization (WA) No. SL-100036-20477-10, Revision 0 (LASO # RA-10-021) and is issued under Management & Operating (M&O) Contract number DE-AC52-06NA25396. This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars. The M&O Contractor DUNS number is 175252894. The description of the work involved under this Work Authorization is shown below:

Experimentally determine whether silicon nanowire solar cells can achieve performance close to that of crystalline silicon cells but with the much lower costs of thin film, amorphous Si solar cells. This performance would lead to a new class of high quality, crystalline solar cells with a cost of ~$0.5/W and a module levelized cost of energy (LCOE) reduced by 1/3 to 1/2 that of current silicon photovoltaic technology. To the performance potential of these new solar cells, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) will fabricate arrays of vertical nanowire, single crystalline silicon p-i-n junctions which are fabricated without metal catalysts. To assess low cost manufacturing of these cells, LANL will develop techniques to grow the nanowire arrays on poly-Si/stainless steel substrates.

Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Contract for WA* (added to description in FedBizOpps):
Los Alamos National Security (LANS) was selected by the Department of Energy (DOE) to participate in this ARRA work as part of a Laboratory-industry collaboration due to LANLs expertise in the subject matter. The work falls within the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy work scope, which is allowed under the prime contract Section J, Appendix B. Statement of Work Section 3.4 entitled Energy Supply of the current Contract based on the following paragraph:  The Contractor shall conduct research that addresses energy supply issues by applying capabilities in the areas of exploration, reservoir modeling, integrated assessments, and environmental transport. The Contractor shall support DOE/NNSAs efforts in the broad areas of energy efficiency, renewable energy, fossil energy, and nuclear energy.
This is a Cost-Reimbursable type contract.  

Place of Contract Performance: Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87544
Site Office Contracting Point of Contact(s):  Caroline T. Crooks, Contracting Officer, 505 606-0249.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE "National Watershed Protection Program Using Point and Nonpoint Source Water Pollution Controls and Total Maximum Daily Loads" multiple award contracts (EP-C-08-001; EP-C-08-002; EP-C-08-003; and EP-C-08-004).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Task Order 17 under EP-C-08-002 is to obligate $100,000 in initial funding in support of the United States Virgin Islands American Recovery and Reinvestment Act In-kind Support. The anticipated period of performance for this work assignment will be from February 5, 2010 though November 5, 2010. The primary objective of this task order is to assist EPA Region II in providing management tools in the areas of sanitary sewage, watershed planning, and green infrastructure for the US Virgin Islands:<br />(a) The sources of fecal coliform pollution are difficult to determine. US Virgin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) believes that failing septic systems contribute greatly to fecal coliform pollution. The task order will assist DPNR in investigating this possibility.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Rainfall and observed data statistics would provide insight to longer range watershed planning.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) The Green Infrastructure task described in this Task Order is intended to target reduction in urban runoff and pollutant loadings by managing the runoff as close to its sources as possible.<br />The great majority of the work will be performed at the contractor's location in Watertown MA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>
