<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have a&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">government approved</span></strong> accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMPORTANT</span></strong>: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;<br />tab=core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">listed in descending order of importance</span></strong> and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The potential contributions of the effort to the U.S. Air Force Full Spectrum SIGINT, and Cyber Operations Technology mission <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge including experience and qualification of the types of personnel and the quantity and quality of the offeror's experience relevant to the requirements. This include an understanding of Air Force and/or Joint cyber operations, and SIGINT/EW tools, platforms, and processes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><strong>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d<br />&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>
<p>This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions apply:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>
<p>6. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GRANT AWARDS ONLY:</span></strong> For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publically releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant. If the proposal is selected for award, the DoD will publically post the abstract to comply with Section 8123 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235).</p>

<DESC>Title of Project:  National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI).
Background: The Northport VA Medical Center's Department of Nursing uses a Nursing Quality Control Indicator and Feedback program to measure itself against similar size facilities and find ways to improve, patient care, patient safety and quality of care that affect the day to day operation in the nursing care environment of the VA Medical Center.
Nursing Quality Control Indicator and Feedback (NQCIF) provides a quarterly information stream that includes national comparison data for facilities like ours. The NQCIF data allow staff nurses and nursing leadership the opportunity to review their data and evaluate nursing performance relative to patient outcomes. Your facility can use the information to establish organizational goals for improvement at the unit level. You can mark your progress in improving the care of patients and the work environment of nurses, avoid costly complications, and assist in marketing the quality of your efforts.
Patient outcome and nurse staffing data are currently collected on adult and pediatric critical care; step down, medical, surgical, medical/surgical, and psychiatric and rehabilitation. RN turnover data are now available for unit types ED, peri-operative, and obstetrics.
Once the data collection period has ended and we have received our facility's information, we will receive our report, including comparison data and analysis, within six weeks.
Collaboration has been a key component in the successful growth of and development of the VA Nursing Staff. Participants can be part of the development process by pilot testing a new indicator and in validity and reliability studies. The program offers the ability to trend data over multiple quarters instead of an isolated, and perhaps misleading, snapshot of performance.
The program offers VA staff tools to assist with efforts to address the needs of our staff, improving their work environment as well as retention and recruitment. Program participants have stated that this survey alone is worth the fee.
Scope of Work: Membership to the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI). Membership access does not involve the purchase of software from the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators. The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables described in this statement of work (SOW), except as may otherwise be specified. NDNQI provides a quarterly information stream that includes national comparison data for facilities like Veterans Health Administration of New York and New Jersey VISN 3. The NDNQI data allows staff nurses and nursing leadership the opportunity to review their data and evaluate nursing performance relative to patient outcomes.
Access to comprehensive online tutorial's for each indicator, program liaisons and quarterly conference calls. A quarterly newsletter is also provided to all participating facilities providing program updates. In addition to ongoing training on the indicators and the database, a continuing education credit is available from program training modules including one on pressure ulcer identification, staging, and sourcing.
The program requires a secure, user-friendly website for member data entry. No software purchase is necessary. XML data files should be accepted.
Type of Contract: Firm-Fixed Price (FFP).
Performance Period: Annual membership period is for one base year and four option years

<p>NNSY Use of Matrix System</p>
<p>The matrix system is an audio video system set up outside the reactor compartment sometimes on the main deck or in hull of an aircraft carrier or off hull for submarines as a control center to direct and observe work on highly radioactive and contaminated reactor compartment components while reducing radiation exposure to the supervisors, engineers from Codes 2310, 2320, 2370, inspectors, radcon technicians, mechanics from shops 26, 31, 38, 41, 56, 64, 72 and senior managers providing job monitoring. The matrix system is used to communicate from outside the reactor compartment procedure work steps, inspections and monitoring with personnel in the reactor compartment.</p>
<p>The matrix system allows the production supervisor to direct and observe the work without being in the reactor compartment. It also allows the engineers to observe the work to ensure compliance to written instruction without being in the reactor compartment. It allows the inspectors to perform surveillance of open systems and inspections without being in the reactor compartment. It allows the radcon technician to observe the work and ensure the correct radiological controls are being exercised without being in the reactor compartment which reduces the risk of radiological insult without being in the reactor compartment. The biggest advantage to the matrix system is the amount of radiation exposure reduced by each person thereby reducing the health risk associated with radiation exposure.</p>
<p>The system would be maintained by Code 361 to support the special attention nuclear work.</p>

<DESC>NASAs GSFC plans to issue a modification to increase the maximum ordering value on an IDIQ task order contract with Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies, Inc. (SGT) to provide additional on/off-site multidiscipline engineering services to support the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) program and the Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office (SSCO). Support includes the study, design, systems engineering, development, fabrication, integration, testing, verification, and operations of space flight, airborne, and ground system hardware and software, including development and validation of new technologies to enable future space and science missions. This modification will increase the IDIQ maximum ordering value from $520M by $123M to $643M. This action requires no extension to the contracts ordering period. <p> NASA/GSFC intends to issue the modification on a noncompetitive basis to SGT in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <p> SGT has the combined training, experience, and expertise to provide uninterrupted mission critical support to JPSS and SSCO.  For SSCO, the required support is necessary to continue Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM)-3 launch readiness, RESTOREL Synergy with the Asteroid Retrieval Missions (ARM), ARM Payload Readiness, Vision Navigator Sensor development effort, STP-H5 Raven Development and launch to the International Space Station, Robotics Facility support for Restore-L and ARM Missions, etc.  For JPSS, the required support is necessary to continue JPSS-1 and JPSS-2 spacecraft development and launch, mission operations ground systems development, operational support for on-orbit NPP spacecraft, etc.  Increasing the maximum ordering value of the contract will allow for JPSS and SSCO requirements to be met until the OMES II competitive follow-on procurement is completed.  Procuring these services from any other source would greatly jeopardize the success of critical and highly visible JPSS and SSCO.	 <p> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on 24 December 2015.

<SOLNBR>P15PS02110
<RESPDATE>091015
<ARCHDATE>09252015
<CONTACT>Gardner, Alanna
<DESC>Replace Anacapa Island Dock Building, Channel Island National Park, Ventura County, California

The National Park Service at Channel Islands National Park (located within Ventura County, California) has a requirement to replace the Anacapa Island dock building.

The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary to fabricate approximately 600 square feet of modular building units on the mainland. The Contractor shall deliver and install the units by joining the units at Landing Cove on Anacapa Island. Anacapa Island is approximately 14 miles from Ventura across the Santa Barbara Channel. There are no cranes available at the Landing Cove, no electricity, and extremely limited lay-down area. There are no dock or pier facilities for mooring in the cove. There are anchors in the cove to stabilize a vessel or barge, and there is a mooring can outside the cove that may be used for the duration of the on-site work.

The project does not include demolition of the existing structure. The National Park Service will demolish and remove the existing structure and disconnect the utilities. The concrete landing that the modular units are to be placed upon must be properly prepared and have a fiber reinforced polymer applied prior to delivery and assembly of the units. The structural members of the modules are a glass fused to wood product. 

Anacapa Island will be closed to the public during the on-site work time period. Park employees must be permitted access through the installation site for periodic shift changes. Up to four workers may be permitted to stay in government-provided quarters that have very limited amenities during the on-site work. The National Park Service will provide an on-site representative for the work at Anacapa Island that will have access to telephone and internet, but the prospective Contractor is advised that there is no wifi, no hard telephone lines, and cell service is very spotty at best.

The project range is estimated to be between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The North American Standard Industrial Classifications System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 236220, with a corresponding size standard of $36.5 million in annual gross receipts for the past three years. 

This acquisition is a Total Small Business Set-Aside. Offers are solicited only from small business concerns. Offers received from concerns that are not small business concerns shall be considered nonresponsive and will be rejected.

Work will include fabrication on the mainland followed by work on Anacapa Island.  It currently is estimated that the mainland fabrication work may begin sometime on or after October 18, 2015, and is estimated to take no more than two months. On-site Anacapa Island work is estimated to take about one month, and the best weather for on-site work would typically be before the end of November. However, weather services are predicting an El Nio weather event, so depending on weather conditions the next best window for on-site work may be mid-summer 2016 at the earliest. In summary, the exact timing of work will be dependent on the weather and will be solidified after award as the weather conditions become known.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on/about August 11, 2015 by electronic means only and can be downloaded along with all related attachments from the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fbo.gov or FedConnect: http://www.fedconnect.net.

qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved
by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures
must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over
the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government
source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or
the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support
acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required
for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed
pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must
submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the
NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures
listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair:
www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or
similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for
source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your
offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source
approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the
Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this
solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted
hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the
ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award
of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at:

<DESC>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) intends to procure the services of LexisNexis, on a sole source basis, for maintenance of the CFTC's Legislative History Database. The database, which was developed by LexisNexis and is currently being hosted by LexisNexis, contains the statutory history of the agency. One of the primary uses of the database is by the agency lawyers who utilize the database to determine the legislative intent of wording in the statutes. A significant and vital feature of the database is that the documents in the agency history include links to cited information that is contained in LexisNexis's proprietary database, and the agency is able to access those documents via the provided links. The maintenance services will include hosting the database, incorporating new legislative documents into the database, maintaining and updating cited links and correcting any errors that are identified in the database. The anticipated contract will have a base period of performance of one (1) year, and four (4) option years. Based on the procurement history of this requirement, CFTC believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government for development of the database by a new contractor. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers and, as such, no solicitation is available. However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the date and time identified above. Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement. Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of CFTC.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) combine to make up the only Federal facility in the United States engaged in the diagnosis of animal diseases, both domestic and foreign. Administered under the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), NVSL is a key element in the support of Federal animal health programs. Each laboratory within NVSL also provides assistance to the state and Federal agencies and laboratories, educational institutions, and foreign governments in the diagnosis of animal diseases.
<p>The NVSL is comprised of four laboratories:<br />1. Diagnostic Bacteriology Laboratory (DBL)<br />2. Diagnostic Virology Laboratory (DVL)<br />3. Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL)<br />4. Pathobiology Laboratory (PL)</p>
<p>The Calibration Laboratory, as part of the NVSL quality system, provides support services to the NVSL Diagnostic Laboratories.</p>
<p>Dedicated to the testing of diagnostic specimens for domestic and foreign animal diseases, three of the laboratories are located in buildings in Ames, Iowa and one FADDL, in Plum Island, New York. The Calibration Laboratory is located in Ames, Iowa.</p>
<p>The NVSL quality management system is an International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 17025, World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Quality Standard and Guidelines for Veterinary Laboratories: Infectious Diseases, ISO/IEC 17043, and ISO Guide 34 accredited program in the fields of biological, chemical, calibration, reference materials, and proficiency tests.</p>
<p>APHIS is seeking information from contractors as to their capacity to perform activities related to provide the required accreditation services described below and verify if there are small business contractors capable of providing this service. The USDA, APHIS intends to establish a five year contract with a single accrediting body capable of meeting all the NVSL accreditation requirements.</p>
<p>The scope of the contract will require the contractor to complete -audits and assessments for the accreditation in each of the four diagnostic laboratories of the NVSL and the National Center for Animal Health Calibration Laboratory to determine that the facilities are performing scope analyses and support activities in accordance with the most current version of the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) Standard 17025, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Quality Standard and Guidelines for Veterinary Laboratories: Infectious Diseases, and the NVSL laboratory quality system, policies and procedures. The accreditation will also include audits and assessments for: ISO/IEC 17043, "Conformity assessment - General requirements for Proficiency Testing" - This standard specifies general requirements for the competence of providers of proficiency testing schemes and for the development and operation of proficiency testing schemes and ISO Guide 34:2000, "General Requirements for the Competence of Reference Material Producers" - This guide specifies general requirement in accordance with which a reference material producer has to demonstrate that it operates, if it is to be recognized as competent to carry out the production of reference materials.</p>
<p>The goal of the audits, assessments and accreditation is for the NVSL to meet the ISO/IEC standards for laboratory testing, the OIE Quality Standard and Guidelines for Veterinary Laboratory Diagnostics and the ISO/IEC standards for proficiency testing and reference material producers. The goal of the calibration audits, assessments and accreditation is to verify the NVSL laboratory personnel are calibrating the equipment correctly.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude for this project is between $150,000.00 - $225,000.00. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 813920 with a small business size standard of $15 million.</p>
<p>The Government acknowledges that responses to this sources sought are not binding offers. The Government will not award a contract based on this Sources Sought Notice or the information received, nor will it reimburse participants for the information they provide. If you are an interested firm please provide the following information: 1) Size of business, including whether your company is a large or small business, and a point of contact; <br />2) DUNS number and CAGE code; 3) A brief Statement of Capability (no more than three pages) which demonstrates the ability to meet the specialized work requirements above. Include any past performance information on contracts of similar size and scope and indicate the degree of work self-performed. Also include past performance references with names and phone numbers.

The ECU is a self-contained, electrically powered unit that provides a minimum of 18,500 BTU/Hr for cooling or 12,000 BTU/Hr for heating, at 600 CFM. It utilizes 230 VAC, single phase 50/60 Hz and draws 4.4 kW at 20 Amps. The ECU is a split-pack configuration and consists of a condenser and an evaporator unit. The ECU is controlled by the ECU Control Unit, which is part of the Evaporator Unit, and is located on the front equipment rack above the workstation inside the shelter. The Evaporator Unit also houses the Evaporator Coil and the Heater Coils. The ECU cools, warms, or circulates existing shelter air, it does not bring in new outside air. The Condenser unit contains the Compressor, Dehydrator Compressor Coils, and Sight Glass all housed in one unit that is located on the front outer wall of the shelter. The Condenser also houses the Access Valves, used to add/remove refrigerant and purge the system during maintenance. This acquisition is for a one-time buy of between 0-75 ECUs with an option for spare parts packages to be provided with the ECUs. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the existing ECUs is Engineered Environments Incorporated. Detailed technical data for the manufacture or acceptance of the existing items is available from the Army. A new performance specification is currently being developed largely based on the existing ECU's performance specifications. Suppliers capable of furnishing this unit must so indicate, by writing via email to scott.h.mahoney4.civ@mail.mil. The response must include production lead time, production capacity by month, surge capacity, number of years part will be available, ranges for price breaks if applicable or any other information that could affect the acquisition, supply and delivery of the parts. The response should also include documentation such as a copy of a purchase order if the supplier was a vendor to the listed source or a statement from listed source demonstrating that the supplier can, in fact, supply the Army with this unit from the supplier listed above. Successful supplier may be required to warrant that the item supplied will satisfactorily perform when used for the purpose intended by the Army. For more information contact Scott Mahoney, RDER-PRP-G, (443) 395-6242. The deadline for response is 23 December 2015.<br />&lt;EMAIL&gt;<br />&lt;ADDRESS&gt; scott.h.mahoney4.civ@mail.mil<br />&lt;DESC&gt;CECOM POC<br />&lt;/SRCSGT&gt;

<CONTACT>Eric Eischen, Phone 3097827144, Email eric.t.eischen.civ@mail.mil - Conrad Baker, Contracting Officer, Phone 3097825417, Email a.c.baker2.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to identify companies capable and qualified to upgrade and maintain the connection of the current Army Land Mobile Radio (LMR) assets with the Japan and Okinawa (J2) LMR Air Force LMR system. The resulting contract would be an 18 month Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) contract.
<p><br />The Army portion of the J2LMR system is based upon Motorola's proprietary hardware and software solutions. It is supported by site controllers, which utilize Motorola software, and Motorola GTR8000 repeaters. The J2LMR system strategy utilizes the current United States Air Force owed LMR system Zone Core infrastructure, five Army Radio Frequency (RF) sites, five Air Force RF sites and eight Marines Corps RF Sites and end user equipment. The Air Force Zone Core infrastructure is located at Kadena Air Force Base Japan. The Army RF Site locations are located at Camp Zama, North Dock, Sagami Depot, Haigamine and Fort Buckner.</p>
<p>Each Army RF location shall be supported by Motorola site controllers and GTR8000 repeaters as in the J2LMR system. The site controller controls how the voice and data communications traffic is handled. The site controller determines which repeater communication traffic is sent to for transmission into the air and also controls which repeater will assume a control channel function if the primary control channel repeater fails. Usage of site controllers with repeaters requires a proprietary relationship with a singular Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in order to provide the trunked repeater system.</p>
<p>The Army portion of the J2LMR system shall also be supported by a System Management Terminal (SMT) as well as Motorola Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (MOSCAD) equipment. The SMT provides overall administrative management of the LMR system to include: adding or subtracting new radios to communicate on the LMR system and designating channels or talk groups. The system management terminal utilizes software that is proprietary to the OEM and requires a proprietary relationship for compatibility between the SMT and the Zone Core. The MOSCAD system provides remote monitoring of RF locations.</p>
<p>Each of the previously mentioned Motorola devices (site controllers, repeaters and system management terminals) also require periodic software updates and patches and must be covered under a warranty.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all equipment and services in support of upgrading and reconnecting the J2LMR Army assets with the J2LMR system.</p>
<p>NOTICE: THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This sources sought is for market research only and does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this sources sought is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>If your organization has the potential capability, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address, telephone number, and size and type of ownership for the organization; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate market information to determine potential market capability to provide supplies and services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions: Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to perform as described above are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by 21 December 2015 no later than Noon Central Time. All responses under this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to Conrad Baker at a.c.baker2.civ@mail.mil and Eric Eischen at eric.t.eischen.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>DLA Land &amp; Maritime is preparing to ADD the 96 NSNs below, spare parts that support the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). AM General (34623) is currently the only approved source for these parts kits; and the approved part numbers are shown below. DLA Land &amp; Maritime does NOT have any technical data with which to procure these items. The purpose of this synopsis is to locate sources interested in becoming approved sources.

<DESC><br />MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requirement for a Custom-made Experimental Drug Compounds for AD/Tg (Alzheimer Disease/Transgenic) Rats.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking small business sources to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying, and subsequently maintaining, a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer for the items described herein. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-446110- Pharmacies and Drug Stores; Small Business Size Standard is $27.5 million.</p>
<p>The NCTR, Division of Neurotoxicology requires an experimental AD drugs to be used for animal (rat) dosing of transgenic (Tg) mice. These drugs are characterized as containing therapeutic and toxicological properties. The purpose is to administer them to an AD/Tg mice population with Alzheimer's disease and the subsequent use of in vitro and in vivo imaging methods to characterize the drug compound's efficacy and toxicity. The drugs will be used in a new type of breeding colony at NCTR, AD/Tg rat strain. This animal is an important model that exhibits all the pathological features commonly seen in humans with AD (Alzheimer's Disease). It is hoped that this model will provide improved understanding of disease development and progression enabling the identification of new biomarkers of the disease and new drug targets.</p>
<p>Transgenic mice have been used to study Alzheimer's disease, but none of them show complete spectrum of AD pathology. The purpose of this protocol is to establish a breeding colony of a genetically engineered rat model of AD to study whether individual components of the metabolic syndrome impact the neurovascular units and associated cerebro-vascular integrity in an animal model of AD. This model has potential to significantly impact FDA science and regulatory policy and will serve to highlight its use as a replacement for currently used models. The following custom-made experimental drug compounds required for this study are as follows:</p>
<p>Performance requirements:</p>
<p>K 114 (25 grams)<br />Ro 90-7501 (10 grams)<br />Amyloid b-peptide (1-42) (rat) (6 milligrams)<br />Citalopram Oxalate (2.5 grams)<br />3Fax-Peracetyl Neu5Ac (750 mg)<br />1,10-Phenanthrolin-5-amine [54258-41-2] (80 grams)<br />Deferoxamine mesylate (75 grams)</p>
<p>Delivery is required within 10 calendar days of receipt of order.<br /><br />FOB Point Destination. All items shall include shipping, handling and in-side delivery to the destination identified herein. Delivery/installation date is within 30 calendar days after receipt of order.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) replaces SOL-R7-16-00003.

Request for Information regarding environmental sample databases and the supporting front-end software for US EPA, Region 7, Laboratory, Kansas City, KS.

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY SOURCES SOUGHT INQUIRY. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking offerors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI/Market Survey or any follow-up information requests. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.

Background
The STC currently has a locally-developed Oracle database application that the Region 7 laboratory uses to manage environmental laboratory information. The contents of the database include descriptions of the analytical service (matrix, method, analytes and reporting limits), customer request information (site, number of samples, locations), specific information about each sample and analysis (location, reference), and the results for each sample (matrix, method, analyte). The four groups of users of this system are laboratory customers, laboratory analysts, laboratory data managers, and static data managers (maintain reference data). The system begins when the customer begins planning the sampling event, continues with sample receipt, analysis, and reporting from the laboratory, and ends with the disposal of samples. 

About 200 forms and reports are needed as the front-end of this system. Initial reports and forms provide the customer with sample planning information such as number of samples and analytical methods, along with field tags and field sheets for samples. Various in-progress reports are used by chemists and managers to monitor schedules, receive annual summaries, view charges, view results, perform quality control measures, and document sample results. Additionally, all sample data is transmitted electronically from the instrument into the database. Final reports to the customers depend on the needs of the project: standard format, standard format with quality control results, single sample reports, and electronic data transfer into EPA databases. Finally, sample disposal reports document and track whether samples are hazardous and are used as part of the waste disposal program in the laboratory.

The Oracle database has been updated to include SEDD. SEDD is a set of agency and program neutral instructions for developing standardized electronic data deliverable (SEDD) formats for environmental analytical data. The updated Oracle database design adds the capability to store information about sample receipt batches, sample preparation batches, and analytical batches, enabling the production of SEDD 2a, 2b, and 3 types of data deliverables.

Purpose and Objectives

U. S. EPA Region 7 Science and Technology Center (STC, laboratory) is looking for information about environmental sample databases and the supporting front-end software. Region 7 is evaluating the next steps to upgrade the current LIMS system, and is interested in learning what possible solutions exist. Region 7 manages sample receipt and analysis for two in-house laboratories and two external (contracted) environmental laboratories. 

Period of Performance: Unknown at this time

Scenarios

1. In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for for full replacement of the database and the front-end forms.
2. In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for a front-end solution for the updated Oracle database.
3. In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for a front-end solution for the Promium database (commercially available database).

All solutions need to be able to migrate historical data from the current Oracle database into the new solution, migrate analytical data from the analytical instruments into the new system, and provide a similar range of forms and reports.

Deliverables include the following:

1. Company Name and DUNS
2. Company point of contact name, email address and telephone number.
3. Demonstration of capability
4. Socioeconomic category
5. Experience working with environmental laboratories
6. Explain how the system would work in the laboratory setting

The OIFS Director will also integrate and coordinate activities amongst the programs, the Forensic Technology Center of Excellence, the National Commission on Forensic Science, Organization of Scientific Area Committees and other DOJ offices and Federal agencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research and Development in Forensic Science for Criminal Justice Purposes Program <br /></span></strong>The goals of the Research and Development in Forensic Science for Criminal Justice Purposes Program Office are to expand the information that can be extracted from traditional types of forensic evidence, and quantify its evidentiary value; to develop reliable and widely applicable tools and technologies that allow faster, cheaper and/or less labor-intensive identification, collection, preservation and analysis of forensic evidence; and to strengthen the scientific basis of the forensic science disciplines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The program will achieve these goals by investing in research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and analysis efforts that will increase knowledge and produce fieldable technologies. Breakthroughs in these areas will create new technologies for use in forensic science laboratories and increase knowledge to support the underlying scientific basis of fielded technologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The program's technology portfolio focuses on multiple areas that include but are not limited to: Forensic Biology (e.g., DNA analysis, RNA analysis, protein analysis, etc.); Forensic Chemistry (drug chemistry, elemental analysis of trace evidence, chemical analysis of evidence resulting from fires/explosives, etc.); Forensic Anthropology (mass disaster victim identification, medicolegal death investigation, identification of missing persons, etc.); Forensic Pathology (toxicological analysis, medicolegal death investigation, etc.); Imaging and Microscopy (analysis and comparison of impression and pattern evidence, microscopic morphological examination of trace evidence, etc.); Spectroscopy/Spectrometry (crime scene investigation, trace materials and chemical analysis, etc.); Forensic Science Laboratory Methods (instrumental analyses, assay development, etc.); and Forensic Science Data Analysis (development of software, statistical methods, databases, etc.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Graduate Research Fellowships Program</strong></span> <br />The goal of the Graduate Research Fellowship Program Office is to increase the pool of researchers who are involved in providing STEM-based solutions to problems that affect criminal justice policy and practice in the United States. Through the GRF-STEM program, NIJ supports STEM graduate education by investing in academic institutions that support outstanding and promising doctoral students. The program will achieve this goal by competitively awarding fellowship grants to graduate students who are enrolled full-time in doctoral degree programs in STEM disciplines at eligible academic institutions; and have proposed dissertation research topics that are relevant to providing solutions to problems that directly affect public safety, crime, and/or the fair and impartial administration of criminal justice in the United States.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DNA Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Program</strong></span> <br />The goals of the DNA Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Program Office are to assist eligible States and units of local government to process, record, screen, and analyze forensic DNA and/or DNA database samples, and to increase the capacity of public forensic DNA and DNA database laboratories to process more DNA samples, thereby helping to reduce the number of forensic DNA and DNA database samples awaiting analysis. The program will achieve these goals by providing financial assistance in the form of grants and cooperative agreements to States and units of local government with existing accredited crime laboratories that conduct forensic DNA and/or DNA database sample analysis with the ability to upload data to the National DNA Index System (NDIS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program</span></strong> <br />The goals of the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program Office are to (1) carry out all or a substantial part of a program intended to improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science or medical examiner services in the State, including those services provided by laboratories operated by the State and those operated by units of local government within the State; (2) eliminate a backlog in the analysis of forensic science evidence, including, among other things, a backlog with respect to firearms examination, latent prints, toxicology, controlled substances, forensic pathology, questioned documents, and trace evidence; and (3) train, assist, and employ forensic laboratory personnel as needed to eliminate such a backlog. The program will achieve these goals by providing both formula and competitive grant awards to States to improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science and medical examiner services, including services provided by laboratories operated by States and/or units of local government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postconviction Testing of DNA Evidence to Exonerate the Innocent Program<br /></span></strong>The goal of the Postconviction Testing of DNA Evidence to Exonerate the Innocent Program Office is to assist States and units of local government with post-conviction DNA testing in cases of violent felony offenses where actual innocence might be demonstrated. The program will achieve these goals by competitively awarding grants to States, units of local government, and public institutions of higher education to assist in defraying the costs associated with post-conviction case review, evidence location, and DNA testing in violent felony cases where the results of such testing might show actual innocence.<br />Missing Persons Program <br />The goals of the Missing Persons Program are to facilitate the association of unidentified human remains with known reference samples. The program will achieve these goals in two ways: (1) through the Using DNA Technology to Identify the Missing Program which provides financial assistance to States, units of local government, nonprofit and for-profit organizations, institutions of higher education, and certain qualified individuals to perform DNA analysis on unidentified human remains and family reference samples to support the efforts of States and units of local government to identify missing persons, and (2) by supporting the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) Program which is a national centralized repository and resource center for missing persons and unidentified decedent records. NamUs is a free online system that can be searched by medical examiners, coroners, law enforcement officials and the general public from all over the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cold Cases Program</span></strong> <br />The goal of the Cold Cases Program is to utilize advances in DNA technology to facilitate the successful resolution of cold cases. The program will achieve these goals by providing assistance to States and units of local government to identify, review, and investigate Uniform Crime Report Part 1 Violent Crime "cold cases" that have the potential to be solved through DNA analysis, and to locate and analyze biological evidence associated with these cases.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) Soliciting from a Single Source with SIRSI Corp., Lehi, UT, to migrate the existing SirsiDynix Symphony system from a government server to a contractor cloud-based server. Symphony is an operating system currently in use by NIST that automates NIST's Research Library, allows books to be cataloged, circulated and shown electronically to patrons. This is a sole source inasmuch as the migration can only be performed by SirsiDynix because the software in use is proprietary, and switching to a different third-party cloud-based system would involve a substantial duplication of costs and efforts already performed under the current contract. There are no authorized resellers to host the product. A firm fixed-price contract modification will be issued on or about 30 Dec 2015. No solicitation package will be issued. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Inquiries will only be accepted via e-mail to randy.schroyer@nist.gov. The government will consider responses received by 5:00PM, EST, 12/21/2015. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a request for competition. No telephone requests will be honored.

<p>AUTHORITY<br />FAR Subpart 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The contractor is to provide follow on service to the NIH High Performance Computer core facility known as Biowulf, a major system. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government and unacceptable delays in meeting the any requirements.</p>
<p><br />Description</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a non-competitive order to The Bioteam Inc, 7 Derosier Drive, Middleton, MA 01949. The Bioteam Inc., is designated a Small Business entity for NAICS 541519.</p>
<p>The NIH, Center for Information Technology (CIT) requires professional Information Technology (IT) services for assessing the operational integration of its critical enterprise IT services and developing an adoption strategy for the execution of these services NIH-wide. The enterprise services span high performance computing, networking, data center and physical building infrastructure, business applications, hosting, storage and messaging services.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this initiative will be for a period of 1 year from award.</p>
<p>BioTeam Inc. is the only company with the required expertise necessary to perform the assessment of the operational integration of CIT's critical enterprise information technology services.

BioTeam has a proven record of effectiveness in biomedical research environments, both within NIH and the broader biomedical research community. <br />In FY2015, BioTeam initiated its initial assessment of the existing infrastructure at CIT. More specifically, BioTeam worked directly with CIT stakeholders to provide a complex technical assessment of configuration options exclusively for CIT for Phase II of the NIH HPC Initiative. Based on the options developed by BioTeam, the contractor subsequently prepared a CIT-specific statement of work under the direction of CIT which was used to acquire, install, integrate, and configure the compute nodes, storage and high-performance networking for Phase II of the NIH HPC Initiative. In order to validate the design and integration of components acquired for Phase II and prepare for Phase III, the contractor must complete the services that began in FY2015. There are no other contractors that are technically capable of preparing CIT for Phase III initiatives based on the integration services that the BioTeam has already provided for CIT.</p>

SYNOPSIS DATE:	9 December 2015

CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS:	N40085 NAVFAC MID-ATLANTIC, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic, Code ACQ2 9324 Virginia Avenue, Norfolk, VA 23511-3095
  
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic (NAVFAC-ML) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2913, which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utilities) in order to address the requirements and circumstances of the installation.
  This contract is referred to as a Utility Energy Savings Contract (UESC).  For purposes of qualifying under this notice, an entity must meet the definition of a Utility before an agreement can be initiated.

The proposed procurement is for the implementation of various Energy Conservation Measures in specified areas via a request for proposal.  This project provides for energy efficiency upgrades at NSA Crane, Indiana.  The primary goal of the project is to reduce energy consumption and provide more sustainable building infrastructure.

The preliminary audit will require on-site building investigation and evaluation to determine if any significant energy conservation opportunities exist, and whether further detail energy analysis is warranted.
  The Government may elect to proceed with further phases under the UESC, which includes, but are not limited to, the feasibility study; the engineering and design phase; and the implementation phase.  The process requires that the responsible Utility must have the ability to provide or obtain financing on terms at least as good as those available to customers in the comparable service class, or with a comparable risk profile.  Therefore, contractors will not receive compensation until completion of the implementation phase, and payments will be based on a long term amortization schedule.  

Interested parties may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein and may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration.
  The submission must include the DUNs Number and Cage Code.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  

Responses to this posting must be submitted to: leighann.walker@navy.mil in PDF format no later than 8 January 2016.  When the interested party submits a response via email, the interested party is required to ensure that an email is received acknowledging receipt of their response from the Government.

<DESC>US Geological Survey in Reston, VA, is soliciting inquiries from companies interested in licensing rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued as exclusive or nonexclusive, and may include specific fields of use. USGS is not providing any funding in conjunction with the potential license. Technology title, "ZONFLO Fluid Sampling System," issued U.S. patent 9,181,799.
<p>Background. Fine resolution discrete ground water sampling allows for mapping of natural and anthropogenic contaminant distributions. In many parts of the United States, such sampling is problematic in fractured-rock aquifers due to complicated patterns of fluid flow.</p>
<p>Fluid sampling in open boreholes tapping fractured-rock aquifers is particularly challenging because of vertical mixing of fluid within the borehole from flow from multiple fractures. The use of downhole pumps to pump water or other fluid from long, open-hole bedrock wells or long-screen sections of wells is problematic because the well bore acts as a conduit and induces vertical flow and mixing of fluid from multiple fractures at different zones (depths) throughout the entire well opening based on the transmissivity of each fracture. The source of the pumped fluid in an open borehole is a mixture of the well bore fluid and the flow-weighted contribution of fluid from multiple fractures. The unknown source origin of the resultant fluid sample is less than ideal for the identification of natural and anthropogenic contaminant pathways.</p>
<p>Packers that straddle the pumps have been used to isolate flow from discrete fractures to reduce capture of well bore fluid. However, the use of packers can be time consuming and logistically difficult in some cases.</p>
<p>Opportunity. The ZONFLO (ZONAL FLOW) allows for discrete sampling through hydraulic containment of flow in long open boreholes or long screen wells. In wells where physical isolation of discrete zones is not possible due to the inability to seal packers, hydraulic containment is an effective alternative. ZONFLO does not require packers or associated equipment. Instead, a multilevel pumping system is used to contain flow. The most significant cost savings is a reduction in equipment, such as a packer truck, needed to deploy packers. Other savings include quicker deployment and the ability to hydraulically profile the well using different zones of the well. In long screen wells with sandpack, hydraulic containment is the only method effective in isolating zones of the aquifer.</p>
<p>This technology can be applied in geographic regions similar to that of the northeast United States.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:bhenry@usgs.gov">bhenry@usgs.gov</a> with the title of this technology in the subject line. Include your preferred contact information and the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about other USGS technologies available for licensing, please visit <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/tech-transfer/available_patents.html">http://www.usgs.gov/tech-transfer/available_patents.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Responses are provided to members of USGS&rsquo;s Office of Policy &amp; Analysis for the purpose of promoting public awareness of USGS owned technologies and conducting market research to determine commercial interest. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, USGS will follow the required formal licensing process. No follow-on procurement is expected to result from the responses to this notice.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>(i) INTRODUCTION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) SOLICITATION TYPE: This combined synopsis/solicitation is a Request for Proposals (RFP) issued by Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on behalf of the National Assessment Group (NAG) for Maritime Engineering and Technical Services to meet the operational and technical service requirements.</p>
<p>(iii) CURRENTNESS: The Solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-84.</p>
<p>(iv) SET ASIDE: It is the intent of the Government to award using 100% Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Business set aside. Market Research has identified there is sufficient competition within this small business concern for such a set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 Exception 4 - Maritime Engineering Services. The small business size standard for the NAICS Code is $38,500,000.00.</p>

<p>(vi) DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Contract Details:</p>
<p>The Government intends to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Services Contract. This contract will have Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type CLINs with a ceiling limit of $9.9 million. The intent is to award multiple IDIQ Contracts, however, the Government reserves the right to award a single IDIQ Contract should the evaluation of proposals reveal one source being most beneficial to the Government.</p>
<p>The Technical Requirements broken down by CLIN are as follows:</p>
<p>Labor CLIN:</p>
<p>1) Navy Special Warfare (NSW) Operational Test and Evaluation Support; <br />2) Navy Special Warfare (NSW) Technical Test and Evaluations Support;</p>
<p>Please see the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS), Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL), and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) for the details to the above categories.</p>
<p>Travel CLIN:</p>
<p>Travel shall be pre-approved by the Contracting Officer's Representative and conducted per FAR Subpart 31.205-46. Travel reimbursement is on a cost reimbursement basis only, and does include G&amp;A, but does not include OH, profit or fees. The contractor will be reimbursed for travel expenses IAW the Government Joint Travel Regulation.<br />Other Direct Costs (ODCs) CLIN:</p>
<p>The Contractor may be required to obtain Other Direct Costs (ODC) such as materials/equipment to be used in performance of this contract. The Government must approve all purchases in advance and prior to the Contractor incurring any charges. <br />Invoicing Details:</p>
<p>The contract holder will be required to invoice directly to the National Assessment Group. Instructions for invoicing, such as Point of Contacts, will be included at the Task Order Level.</p>
<p>(vii) DELIVERY:</p>
<p>Delivery Requirements<br /><br />Period of Performance (PoP) and service site locations will be determined at the Task Order level.</p>
<p>(viii) PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS: The provision of FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The description below are added as an Addendum to FAR clause 52.212-1.</p>
<p>&bull; All proposals submitted shall provide the name, phone number, and email address of their primary Point of Contact for this order, and their Cage and DUNs codes.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors may submit multiple proposals per expertise listed in the PWS or as one collective proposal.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall submit pricing as hourly labor rates for the labor category of Operational Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Support and Technical Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Support. Travel and ODC pricing data is not required for submission.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Offeror shall include a description of the expertise they can provide and their plan to ensure a rapid response to a given task order.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall detail the expertise they are able to provide for both the Operational and Technical Support.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall describe their ability to recruit and retain talent needed for the expertise described in the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall separate pricing data, technical and past performance data into three separate PDF files.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall ensure this information is updated and accurate within the System for Award Management (SAM) website (www.sam.gov) to ensure they are registered to the appropriate NAICS Code.</p>
<p>Offerors may propose to one or all required skill sets outlined in the Performance Work Statement. Not proposing to a specific skill set will not exclude an offeror from evaluation and potential award.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to hold discussions, but reserves the right to do so. In the event of discussions, the offerors within the competitive range will be notified.</p>
<p>(ix) EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS: The provision of FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items applies to this solicitation. The Evaluation of Proposals for this Solicitation will be as follows:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Proposals:</p>
<p>Offerors who do not meet the required instructions in paragraph viii, listed above, will be listed as unresponsive in the evaluation.</p>
<p>The award will be made based upon the best overall (i.e., Best Value) proposal(s) that are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government using Tradeoff procedures, with appropriate considerations given to the three published evaluation factors: Combined Technical / Risk Rating, Past Performance Rating, and Price Rating. Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. Subjective judgment against objective criteria is implicit in the evaluation process.<br />The Government intends to award multiple IDIQ contracts to meet the requirement, but reserves the right to award a single award should a single offeror present themselves to be able to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that award may be made to other than the lowest-priced proposal(s) if the Government determines that paying a price premium is warranted due to the evaluation of non-price factors. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated proposal(s), if the Government determines that paying a price premium is not warranted. As proposal ratings tend toward equality, Cost/Price will become a more determinative factor. <br />The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract(s) without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3, as applicable, if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />Offerors may be given a chance to clarify aspects of their proposal that require clarifications. However, with clarifications, offerors are not given an opportunity to respond to alter, change, or revise their proposals. <br />Relative Importance of Evaluation Factors:<br />The Combined Technical/Risk Rating is the most important factor. The Combined Technical / Risk Ratings and Past Performance Ratings, when combined, are significantly more important than Price, which will be evaluated, but not assigned an adjectival rating (defined below).</p>
<p>COMBINED TECHNICAL/RISK RATINGS:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate how the proposal items meet the PWS requirements on a range scaling from Unacceptable, Marginally Acceptable, Acceptable, Good, and Outstanding. The definitions are as follows:</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable.<br />Marginal: Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high.<br />Acceptable: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.</p>
<p>Good: Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low.</p>
<p>Outstanding: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate relevant past performance in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3, as applicable, to ensure there has been no recent (within the past three years) negative past performance. The Government will rate Past Performance to determine relevance and confidence.</p>
<p>Relevant Levels are defined as:</p>
<p>Not Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Somewhat Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Very Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Confidence Levels are defined as:</p>
<p>Unknown Confidence (Neutral): No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />No Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Cost/Price:</p>
<p>Cost/Price evaluations will be based on the rates submitted in the attached Labor Rate sheet. These will be compared using the three year base period for Base Rates and one year option for the Option Rates. Each year will be measured with 2080 hours per year. The combined 3 base years and 1 option year will establish the Total Evaluated Price (TEP) in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1. The Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be the sum of the completed Labor CLINs, to include option(s). The TEP will be used in the Government's cost-technical tradeoff to select the Awardee(s) for this contract. This analysis will be used to determine the Best Value for the Government and its mission. Evaluation of option(s) shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>Travel and ODCs are not included in the cost/price analysis.</p>
<p>(x) OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATION: The provision of FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.</p>
<p>Offerors will need to ensure this information is updated and accurate within the System for Award Management (SAM) website (www.sam.gov) by the closing of this RFP.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) - Wheelchair Washer Installation

Introduction and Overview: This Statement of Work is to relocate and install a wheelchair washer and the removal of a large station scale.   

Background: The scale in need of removal is a large 2,000 lb. inlaid, Detecto station scale.  The wheelchair washer is an Aqua Phase AQ4000 sealed washer.  The Wheelchair Washer's total Outer Dimensions are: Width 63 "  Length 96 3/4 , Height 73". Effective Chamber Dimensions-Width 40 " Length-93 ".  Height 93 "

Objectives: VAMC Northport's wheelchair washer, once installed, will allow the station to clean our rolling stock in-house without seeking the services of an outside contractor.  This will result in significant savings for Veterans Affairs.

Period of Performance: Contractor is expected to complete work within 45 days of award.

Place of Performance: Building 200, Scale Room near loading dock area.

Scope of Work: The scope is to install a wheelchair washer and remove a large station scale. After removal of the scale, the area must be filled in with rebar and cement to make level with existing floor.  The double doors in this area must be removed to install the new wheelchair washer.  Connect electric to existing electrical outlets.  Connect water supply to existing water lines.  Test unit operation after installation.

Safety Codes: It will be expected that VAMC safety codes will be adhered to with the hardware to be installed.  Installers should follow safety guidelines pertaining to professional code standards. 

Special Material Requirements: The Aqua Phase wheelchair washer, once relocated, needs hookups to two hoses-one for hot water and one for drain.  The Aqua Phase 4000 will then have to be connected to the appropriate power source.

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Jennifer Pacheco Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-4586 Email: jennifer.l.pacheco19.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<CONTACT>Erin E Williams, Email williamsee3@state.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this project is to obtain the services of a contractor to deliver experiential, professional training seminars for USG foreign affairs personnel for a course entitled Leadership and Authority in Groups (course number PT137) and using a methodology often referred to as "Group Dynamics," "Group Relations," "Tavistock-type," or similar methodology for understanding how unconscious thoughts and feelings significantly impact leadership, decision-making, and work when in groups. International relations require understanding and sensitivity to increasingly diverse, complex, and different norms present in work teams - and this course is an important component of building the necessary skill sets.
<p>Group Dynamics training allows participants to study the ways in which authority is vested in leaders by others, to study the factors involved as they happen, to study the covert processes that operate in and among groups, and to study the problems encountered in the exercise of authority. Participants are provided with experience-based group opportunities to study their own behavior as it happens, and course events allow consultation with contract employees ("Consultants") to facilitate that task. The hallmark of this type of methodology is the attempt to more fully see things as they are in organizational life. The course is designed to help participants explore and identify the causes of organizational distress so that upon returning to their workplaces, they can recognize them more clearly. Participants in this type of training can increase their understanding about the nature and exercise of their own authority as well as that of others, and can therefore be equipped to deal more effectively with the challenges of working in a range of organizations. In particular, participants can be more prepared to make decisions about how to take on the responsibilities of leadership and/or followership.<br />&nbsp;</p>

Traditional procurement and assistance processes sometimes take too long and are ineffective at deploying state-of-the-art Homeland Security innovations. Therefore, DHS has developed an Innovation framework to be implemented utilizing the flexibility of an Other Transaction Solicitation (OTS) to engage non-traditional Government contractors, including start-up companies. This engagement is intended to better understand and assist new companies so they have more opportunities to work with the Department. Through targeted non-dilutive funding and providing opportunities for operational testing and market access, DHS hopes to incentivize product developers to open the aperture of their development roadmaps to include homeland security solutions. DHS refers to this OTS, and will refer to subsequent OTS amendment employing this framework, as an "Innovation OTS." <br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

Submittals should use no more than 2 pages per project. The firm must explain how the past performance information is relevant to the proposed contract. Submittals must include examples of work completed from each of the work categories listed above (SF 330, Part I, Section F). Firms should provide examples of successfully completed work that encompass the list below (we are looking for strong examples of the following work that help illustrate the level of complexity your firm(s) are capable of accomplishing):<br />&bull; Flood risk management studies, ecosystem restoration studies, water supply reallocation studies, and/ or stream bank restoration studies that your firm(s) has completed and experience with HEC-FDA, HEC-FIA, IWR Plan, and/or developing water supply demand models (in support of water supply reallocation studies).<br />&bull; EIS's or complex EA's, integrated feasibility studies, and experience with HEP-HSI, HEC-EFM, FQI, or other professionally accepted ecological analysis tools that your firm(s) has completed. <br />&bull; Examples of relevant hydrology and hydraulics modeling (HEC- RAS, HEC-ResSim, or other professionally accepted engineering analysis tools) that your firm(s) has utilized in completing projects relevant to this contract.<br />&bull; Examples of NHPA Section 106 coordination, cultural resource surveys, or other NHPA compliance activities that your firm(s) has completed.</p>
<p>2. Professional qualifications of the proposed team members (including subcontractors) in providing specialized experience in relevant water resource development planning services. Key services that may be required to be performed by professionals holding current appropriate licensure or certification are: civil, structural, hydrologic, hydraulic, electrical, mechanical, environmental, and geotechnical engineers. However, the proposal will not require a licensed professional for each engineer type. Preference will be given to firms that submit resumes demonstrating highly qualified (in relation to this IDIQ solicitation): Project managers, biologists/ ecologists, economists, water resource planners, hydraulic and hydrologic engineers, civil engineers, geotechnical engineers, and cultural resource specialists. Evaluation of these disciplines will consider education, training, relevant experience in water resource planning services similar to those listed in the work categories above, and longevity with the firm. Any past planning experience on USACE water resource planning projects should be identified. This selection criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key project managers and senior technical experts (not organization management) and not the number of personnel, which is addressed under the capacity criterion. This criterion is also specifically concerned with staff that the firm expects to perform work awarded under this contract. Resumes should not exceed one page in length. (SF 330, Part I, Sections E, F, and G)</p>
<p>Provide resumes for two (2) project managers (team leaders) for task orders.</p>
<p>Provide resumes for three (3) senior biologist/ ecologists with at least 10 years of experience as a biologist/ ecologist. Also provide the resume of 1 journeyman staff member within this discipline.</p>
<p>Provide resumes for two (2) senior economists with at least 10 years of experience as an economist. Also provide the resume of 1 journeyman staff member within this discipline.</p>
<p>Provide resumes for two (2) senior water resource planners with at least 10 years of experience as water resource planners. Also provide the resume of 1 journeyman staff member within this discipline.</p>
<p>Provide resumes for two (2) senior engineers in each of the following fields: civil engineering, hydrology and hydraulic engineering, and geotechnical engineering. Also provide the resume of 1 journeyman staff member within one of these engineering disciplines.</p>
<p>Provide a resume for one (1) senior cultural resources specialist/ archaeologist with at least 10 years of experience as a cultural resources specialist. Also provide the resume of 1 journeyman staff member within this discipline.</p>
<p>3. Capacity to complete assigned work. The availability of an adequate number of personnel in the key disciplines shall be presented to ensure that the firm can meet required schedules of multiple, simultaneous task orders. Firms shall demonstrate the capacity to accomplish at least four (4) $200,000 simultaneous individual task orders, or two (2) $500,000 simultaneous task orders. The evaluation will consider the experience of the firm and any subcontractors in similarly sized projects, and the availability of an adequate number of personnel in key disciplines. (SF 330, Part I, Sections E, G, and H)</p>
<p>This criterion will be evaluated through the submittal of a management plan. A management plan shall be presented that includes an organization chart and addresses team organization, any anticipated sub-contractors or entities to supplement the team, quality control procedures, explanation of the ability to complete multiple simultaneous task orders and/ or task orders within a reasonably aggressive schedule, cost control, coordination of in-house disciplines and consultants, and the anticipated extent of the small business considerations measured as a percentage of the total estimated effort. The SF 330 shall clearly indicate the primary office where the work will be performed and the staffing at this office. The management plan shall be organized into the following sections: (a) Quality Control Procedures, (b) Subcontractor Management Plan, (c) Schedule Development and Maintenance (including completion of multiple simulations task orders), (d) Change Management Plan (address risks to schedule, budget, staff turnover, etc.), (e) Communication Plan (internal communication and communication with the USACE), and (f) Current Active Contracts. The evaluation will consider the key persons identified in Sections D, E, and G of the SF330, as well as other available staff and information provided in Section H and Part II (SF 330, Part I, Section H).</p>
<p>4. Past performance on DoD and other relevant contracts as determined by Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and other sources. This criterion will focus on evaluation of overall ratings. Note: Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) may also be submitted to provide or supplement a firm's past performance with DoD or other than U.S. Governmental clients. Firms which choose to use the PPQ may obtain a PPQ standard form by submitting a request to the below referenced POC via email.</p>
<p>SECONDARY CRITERIA: <br />5. Extent of participation of SB, SDB, WOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone, and, if appropriate, historically black colleges and universities, measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort. Management plans must demonstrate past use and current ability to use small businesses, including the different categories of small businesses such as Historically Black College and University or Minority Institutions, Women-Owned Small Businesses and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses. Small business entities that are awarded one of these IDIQs must complete a minimum of 50% of the work. This information can be placed within the Management Plan. (SF 330, Part I, Section H, Item 3)</p>
<p>6. Volume of DOD A-E contract awards in the last 12 months, with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms, including SB and SDB. When IDIQs are involved, this selection criterion will consider the total value of task orders actually issued by agencies in the last 12 months, not the potential value of the contracts nor will it consider options that have not yet been exercised on any type of contract.

12. Description:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-16-Q-200050 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-85 effective 4 December 2015.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  

See attached documents titled: 
&#61607;	Requirements - HSCG38-16-Q-200050 and
&#61607;	 Terms and Conditions  HSCG38-16-Q-200050. 

Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  

Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.

NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED.  ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. 

Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government.  For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.

NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 15 December 2015 at 1:15 pm EST.   Anticipated award date is on or about 15 December 2015.  E-mail quotations are preferred and may be sent to Isaac.l.brothers@uscg.mil.  Please indicate HSCG38-16-Q-200050 in subject line. Quotations may also be mailed to the following address:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
	
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in, writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference.

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.<br />(3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.<br />(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer):<br />(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice met the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract.<br />(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment-<br />(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic);<br />(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures;<br />(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and<br />(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices.<br />(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost-<br />(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and<br />(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices.<br />(5) Overpayments/Underpayments.

The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall-<br />(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-<br />(A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);<br />(B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable;<br />(C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and<br />(D) Contractor point of contact.<br />(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.<br />(6) <br />(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due.

The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if-<br />(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner;<br />(B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or<br />(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.60702).<br />(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment.<br />(v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:<br />(A) The date fixed under this contract.<br />(B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination.<br />(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on-<br />(A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor;<br />(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or<br />(C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.<br />(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.<br />(viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion invoice" and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.<br />(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions.<br />(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.<br />(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.<br />(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.<br />(8) Prompt payment.

For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.<br />(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.<br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount computed under paragraph (i) Payments of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours expended in furnishing work not delivered to or accepted by the Government shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a) (4) of this clause, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.<br />ADDENDUM to FAR CLAUSE 52.212-4: the following paragraphs are added to the clause:</p>
<p>FAR 52.217-7 OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY - SEPARATELY PRICED LINE ITEM (MAR 1989) - <br />VARIATION<br />The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence, initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;</p>
<p>(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-</p>
<p>(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and<br />(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or</p>
<p>(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.</p>
<p>(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>

<p>(i) warrants;</p>
<p>(ii) options;</p>
<p>(iii) contracts to acquire stock;</p>
<p>(iv) convertible debt instruments; and</p>
<p>(v) others similar interests.</p>

<p>VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) REGULATIONS</p>
<p>(g) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs. Certain SIPs may also mandate certain Contractors to operate under the terms of a compliance plan intended to reduce VOC emissions.</p>
<p>(h) Contractors, therefore, must submit the following to the designated Port Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award:</p>
<p>1) Copies of any federal, state or local permits required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places;<br />2) Copies of any compliance plans required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places.</p>

<p>INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the Contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements.</p>
<p>Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>The name and telephone number of the U.S. Coast Guard Inspector will be provided after the award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(k) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(l) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any Quotation submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the Quotation includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the Quotation.</p>
<p>(m) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor and shall be included in the Composite Labor Rate. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>

<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(n) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:</p>
<p>(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, consumables, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee);<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:</p>
<p>Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating Material Handling<br />Housekeeping Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration Security<br />Testing <br />(8) all consumables;</p>
<p>(o) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(p) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect</p>
<p>to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the Contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the Contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the Contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed.</p>
<p>2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The Contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the Contractor at time of award. The Contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The Contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the Contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all Government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the Contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The Contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree<br />modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</p>

<p>Quality of Product or Service <br />Did the customer get what was specified?<br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?

<DESC>(i) INTRODUCTION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) SOLICITATION TYPE: This combined synopsis/solicitation is a Request for Proposals (RFP) issued by Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on behalf of the National Assessment Group (NAG) for Maritime Engineering and Technical Services to meet the operational and technical service requirements.</p>
<p>(iii) CURRENTNESS: The Solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-84.</p>
<p>(iv) SET ASIDE: It is the intent of the Government to award using 100% Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Business set aside. Market Research has identified there is sufficient competition within this small business concern for such a set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 Exception 4 - Maritime Engineering Services. The small business size standard for the NAICS Code is $38,500,000.00.</p>
<p>(v) Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs): This CLIN structure for the IDIQ Contract is listed below:</p>
<p>Base Ordering Period (3-years):</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 - Labor (Firm Fixed Price)<br />CLIN 0002 - Travel <br />CLIN 0003 - Other Direct Costs (ODCs) <br />CLIN 0004 - Contract Manpower Reporting (CMR)</p>

<p>CLIN 1001 - Labor (Firm Fixed Price)<br />CLIN 1002 - Travel <br />CLIN 1003 - Other Direct Costs (ODCs) <br />CLIN 1004 - Contract Manpower Reporting (CMR)</p>
<p>The Labor, Travel, and ODC CLINs will be issued with the unit "Job" at a Quantity of 1. The CMR CLINs will be issued at the unit "each" and the quantity will vary based on the required deliveries.</p>
<p>(vi) DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Contract Details:</p>
<p>The Government intends to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Services Contract. This contract will have Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type CLINs with a ceiling limit of $9.9 million. The intent is to award multiple IDIQ Contracts, however, the Government reserves the right to award a single IDIQ Contract should the evaluation of proposals reveal one source being most beneficial to the Government.</p>
<p>The Technical Requirements broken down by CLIN are as follows:</p>
<p>Labor CLIN:</p>
<p>1) Navy Special Warfare (NSW) Operational Test and Evaluation Support; <br />2) Navy Special Warfare (NSW) Technical Test and Evaluations Support;</p>
<p>Please see the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS), Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL), and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) for the details to the above categories.</p>
<p>Travel CLIN:</p>
<p>Travel shall be pre-approved by the Contracting Officer's Representative and conducted per FAR Subpart 31.205-46. Travel reimbursement is on a cost reimbursement basis only, and does include G&amp;A, but does not include OH, profit or fees. The contractor will be reimbursed for travel expenses IAW the Government Joint Travel Regulation.<br />Other Direct Costs (ODCs) CLIN:</p>
<p>The Contractor may be required to obtain Other Direct Costs (ODC) such as materials/equipment to be used in performance of this contract. The Government must approve all purchases in advance and prior to the Contractor incurring any charges. <br />Invoicing Details:</p>
<p>The contract holder will be required to invoice directly to the National Assessment Group. Instructions for invoicing, such as Point of Contacts, will be included at the Task Order Level.</p>
<p>(vii) DELIVERY:</p>
<p>Delivery Requirements<br /><br />Period of Performance (PoP) and service site locations will be determined at the Task Order level.</p>
<p>(viii) PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS: The provision of FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The description below are added as an Addendum to FAR clause 52.212-1.</p>
<p>&bull; All proposals submitted shall provide the name, phone number, and email address of their primary Point of Contact for this order, and their Cage and DUNs codes.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors may submit multiple proposals per expertise listed in the PWS or as one collective proposal.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall submit pricing as hourly labor rates for the labor category of Operational Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Support and Technical Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Support. Travel and ODC pricing data is not required for submission.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Offeror shall include a description of the expertise they can provide and their plan to ensure a rapid response to a given task order.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall detail the expertise they are able to provide for both the Operational and Technical Support.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall describe their ability to recruit and retain talent needed for the expertise described in the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall separate pricing data, technical and past performance data into three separate PDF files.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall ensure this information is updated and accurate within the System for Award Management (SAM) website (www.sam.gov) to ensure they are registered to the appropriate NAICS Code.</p>
<p>Offerors may propose to one or all required skill sets outlined in the Performance Work Statement. Not proposing to a specific skill set will not exclude an offeror from evaluation and potential award.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to hold discussions, but reserves the right to do so. In the event of discussions, the offerors within the competitive range will be notified.</p>
<p>(ix) EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS: The provision of FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items applies to this solicitation. The Evaluation of Proposals for this Solicitation will be as follows:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Proposals:</p>
<p>Offerors who do not meet the required instructions in paragraph viii, listed above, will be listed as unresponsive in the evaluation.</p>
<p>The award will be made based upon the best overall (i.e., Best Value) proposal(s) that are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government using Tradeoff procedures, with appropriate considerations given to the three published evaluation factors: Combined Technical / Risk Rating, Past Performance Rating, and Price Rating. Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. Subjective judgment against objective criteria is implicit in the evaluation process.<br />The Government intends to award multiple IDIQ contracts to meet the requirement, but reserves the right to award a single award should a single offeror present themselves to be able to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that award may be made to other than the lowest-priced proposal(s) if the Government determines that paying a price premium is warranted due to the evaluation of non-price factors. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated proposal(s), if the Government determines that paying a price premium is not warranted. As proposal ratings tend toward equality, Cost/Price will become a more determinative factor. <br />The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract(s) without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3, as applicable, if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />Offerors may be given a chance to clarify aspects of their proposal that require clarifications. However, with clarifications, offerors are not given an opportunity to respond to alter, change, or revise their proposals. <br />Relative Importance of Evaluation Factors:<br />The Combined Technical/Risk Rating is the most important factor. The Combined Technical / Risk Ratings and Past Performance Ratings, when combined, are significantly more important than Price, which will be evaluated, but not assigned an adjectival rating (defined below).</p>
<p>COMBINED TECHNICAL/RISK RATINGS:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate how the proposal items meet the PWS requirements on a range scaling from Unacceptable, Marginally Acceptable, Acceptable, Good, and Outstanding. The definitions are as follows:</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable.<br />Marginal: Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high.<br />Acceptable: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.</p>
<p>Good: Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low.</p>
<p>Outstanding: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate relevant past performance in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3, as applicable, to ensure there has been no recent (within the past three years) negative past performance. The Government will rate Past Performance to determine relevance and confidence.</p>
<p>Relevant Levels are defined as:</p>
<p>Not Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Somewhat Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Very Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Confidence Levels are defined as:</p>
<p>Unknown Confidence (Neutral): No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />No Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Cost/Price:</p>
<p>Cost/Price evaluations will be based on the rates submitted in the attached Labor Rate sheet. These will be compared using the three year base period for Base Rates and one year option for the Option Rates. Each year will be measured with 2080 hours per year. The combined 3 base years and 1 option year will establish the Total Evaluated Price (TEP) in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1. The Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be the sum of the completed Labor CLINs, to include option(s). The TEP will be used in the Government's cost-technical tradeoff to select the Awardee(s) for this contract. This analysis will be used to determine the Best Value for the Government and its mission. Evaluation of option(s) shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>Travel and ODCs are not included in the cost/price analysis.</p>
<p>(x) OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATION: The provision of FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.</p>
<p>Offerors will need to ensure this information is updated and accurate within the System for Award Management (SAM) website (www.sam.gov) by the closing of this RFP.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

(b) The Contractor shall comply with the FAR clauses in this paragraph (b) that the Contracting Officer has indicated as being incorporated in this contract by reference to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (Contracting Officer check as appropriate.) <BR> <BR>[] (1) 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government (SEP 2006), with Alternate I (OCT 1995) (41 U.S.C. 4704 and 10 U.S.C. 2402).

<DESC>Request for Information regarding environmental sample databases and the supporting front-end software for US EPA, Region 7, Laboratory, Kansas City, KS.

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY SOURCES SOUGHT INQUIRY.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking offerors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI/Market Survey or any follow-up information requests.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.

Background
The STC currently has a locally-developed Oracle database application that the Region 7 laboratory uses to manage environmental laboratory information.  The contents of the database include descriptions of the analytical service (matrix, method, analytes and reporting limits), customer request information (site, number of samples, locations), specific information about each sample and analysis (location, reference), and the results for each sample (matrix, method, analyte).  The four groups of users of this system are laboratory customers, laboratory analysts, laboratory data managers, and static data managers (maintain reference data).  The system begins when the customer begins planning the sampling event, continues with sample receipt, analysis, and reporting from the laboratory, and ends with the disposal of samples.  

About 200 forms and reports are needed as the front-end of this system.  Initial reports and forms provide the customer with sample planning information such as number of samples and analytical methods, along with field tags and field sheets for samples.  Various in-progress reports are used by chemists and managers to monitor schedules, receive annual summaries, view charges, view results, perform quality control measures, and document sample results. Additionally, all sample data is transmitted electronically from the instrument into the database.  Final reports to the customers depend on the needs of the project:  standard format, standard format with quality control results, single sample reports, and electronic data transfer into EPA databases.  Finally, sample disposal reports document and track whether samples are hazardous and are used as part of the waste disposal program in the laboratory.

The Oracle database has been updated to include SEDD.  SEDD is a set of agency and program neutral instructions for developing standardized electronic data deliverable (SEDD) formats for environmental analytical data.  The updated Oracle database design adds the capability to store information about sample receipt batches, sample preparation batches, and analytical batches, enabling the production of SEDD 2a, 2b, and 3 types of data deliverables.

Purpose and Objectives

U. S. EPA Region 7 Science and Technology Center (STC, laboratory) is looking for information about environmental sample databases and the supporting front-end software.  Region 7 is evaluating the next steps to upgrade the current LIMS system, and is interested in learning what possible solutions exist.  Region 7 manages sample receipt and analysis for two in-house laboratories and two external (contracted) environmental laboratories. 

Period of Performance:  Unknown at this time

Scenarios

1.	In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for for full replacement of the database and the front-end forms.
2.	In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for a front-end solution for the updated Oracle database.
3.	In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for a front-end solution for the Promium database (commercially available database).

All solutions need to be able to migrate historical data from the current Oracle database into the new solution, migrate analytical data from the analytical instruments into the new system, and provide a similar range of forms and reports.

Deliverables include the following:

1.	Company Name and DUNS
2.	Company point of contact name, email address and telephone number.
3.	Demonstration of capability
4.	Socioeconomic category
5.	Experience working with environmental laboratories
6.	Explain how the system would work in the laboratory setting
7.      Explain who would perform minor and major changes

Please do not include any cost information at this time.  Your company may provide information on as many Scenarios, as applicable to your qualifications (even if it is just for one Scenario).  Be sure to reference each specific Scenario your information is referring to.

For more details on this requirement, please go to:  www.fedconnect.net

All questions shall be sent through Fedconnect only.  All information pertaining to this RFI shall be submitted through Fedconnect only.  Questions/information received by other means than Fedconnect will not be accepted.  All questions must be submitted, no later than December 31, 2015.

All information must be submitted through Fedconnect, no later than January 7, 2016 at 12:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment (A00001) is to: 

1.	Release the FINAL synopsis/solicitation VA118-16-R-0882.  Amendment A00001 represents the official release of this solicitation, which is no longer a draft.  Changes from the draft are not explicitly highlighted.  
2.	Extend the proposal due date to December 18, 2015 at 8AM EST.
3.	Communicate with the vendors that Q&A's are scheduled to be released along with any changes to the solicitation and attachments by December 11, 2015.

This OFFICIAL synopsis/solicitation is for a firm-fixed-price multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) enterprise contract to satisfy an ongoing need at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) enterprise level to procure or lease Multifunctional Devices (MFDs).  This will fulfill VA's printing, copying, and scanning needs (including installation, configuration, training, and standard one-year commercial warranty support and maintenance) by offering eight unique MFD configurations for purchase or lease.  This acquisition is required in order to provide VA organizations with an efficient means of replacing and/or refreshing its MFD inventory that is at or approaching its end-of-life.  Establishment of a multiple-award ID/IQ enterprise vehicle will enable any VA organization to quickly and efficiently acquire current generation MFDs to meet its minimum MFD requirements.  

The IDIQ contract will consist of a single 2-year ordering period.  This will be a competitive acquisition and a 100% Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside.  VA intends to make up to three awards and reserves the right to make additional awards if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  

The NAICS code for this procurement is anticipated to be 334118.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Contract Action to Extend Services - COCESS 
<SOLNBR>FA2835-15-D-0005
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>122315
<CONTACT>Amy MacDonough, Phone 7812250301, Email amy.macdonough@us.af.mil - Alissa Turner, Phone 7812250187, Email alissa.turner@us.af.mil
<DESC><strong>Extension of Services through&nbsp;29 February 2016.</strong><br /><br />Notice of intent to extend services. This action will result in a modification to the current contract, FA2835-15-D-0005 with MaraTech Engineering Services, Inc, 5 Carriage Lane, Wakefield, MA, for a period of two (2) months with a one (1) month option period. The period of time this extension will be from 1 January 2016 to 29 February 2016 with an optional extension through 31 March 2016.&nbsp; <br />This extension is needed to satisfy the Contractor Operated Civil Engineering Supply Store (COCESS) requirement at Hanscom Air Force Base, MA (HAFB) until award of the COCESS follow-on. The COCESS follow-on solicitation, FA2835-16-R-0001, is currently open and being competed during the period of the extension. <br />Background: This COCESS located on HAFB supports the efforts of the 66th Air Base Group Civil Engineering Squadron (66 ABG/CE). 66 ABG/CE supports $550M of assets across the base.&nbsp; HAFB utilizes the COCESS contract to purchase the hardware and materials required to remedy work orders for HAFB assets. Items required to remedy work orders range from hazardous chemicals to ceiling tiles, therefore the COCESS must maintain sourcing expertise for a variety of different industries. On average, 66 ABG/CE receives 30 work orders per day, and due to limited staffing primarily responds to only orders designated as emergency or urgent requests, which require 24 hours and seven calendar days lead times, respectively. The COCESS plays a critical role in fulfilling these numerous emergency and urgent work order requests by establishing partnerships with local suppliers to source hardware in these required timeframes. To ensure that hardware on the recurring items list is readily available to 66 ABG/CE, the COCESS maintains an on-site inventory as well as sources non-recurring items within the required timeframes. This extension of services is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements" as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. An award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays to the Government in fulfilling the Air Force's requirements. It would take approximately four to six weeks for a new contractor to setup and stock a COCESS to meet the needs of Hanscom AFB and establish local vendor lists that are required to meet both competition requirements for non-recurring items and the deadlines required. 66 ABG/CE currently depends solely on the COCESS for necessary parts and equipment to complete mission essential projects on HAFB; therefore any lapse in contract coverage would cause unacceptable delays in Civil Engineering's ability to maintain fully functional facilities on the installation. Administrative time, and delays in delivery or availability, could delay repairs to HAFB infrastructure, possibly resulting in an extended period of decreased functionality of mission essential facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, MaraTech personnel possess Registered Environmental Manager (REM) and Environmental Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP) certifications, making them uniquely qualified to store and manage hazardous materials in accordance with Department of Defense and Federal regulations. <br />Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to this extension of services. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this extension. A determination by the Government to extend these services and not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to extend these services. Any responses to this notice of contract action shall be submitted to Amy MacDonough at amy.macdonough@us.af.mil and Alissa Turner at alissa.turner@us.af.mil.<br />&nbsp;

<CONTACT>Gail E. Marsh, Contracting Officer, Phone 315-330-7518, Email Gail.Marsh@us.af.mil
<DESC><br /><br />The purpose of this Amendment to BAA RIK-2015-0004 is to make the following changes to:
<p>1) SECTION I, "Funding Opportunity Description": Add an additional topic, "East African Language Collections" <br /><br />2) SECTION III, "Eligibility Requirements": Add special instructions regarding foreign participation that are <strong>specific to the "East African language Collections" ONLY</strong>; and<br /><br />3) SECTION IV, "Application and Submission Information": Add submission date for the new Focus Award and revise the current white paper submission dates for the general topic submissions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHANGE SUMMARY:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION I</span>, "Funding Opportunity Description". The following Focus Area is added:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Area: East African Language Collections</span>. Under this focus area, the Government is seeking to explore low resources languages to see if current techniques can be applied. These datasets will be used to study the differences and understand how languages and dialects might differ in these regions of speech. These datasets are vital to understanding the fundamentals and seeing whether algorithms that we have are sufficient to be able to help determine their origin or whether further research is needed.</p>
<p>Offerors may propose to answer multiple or single tasks (with the exception of Task I, which requires the use of Task II).</p>
<p><strong>Task I</strong>: An audio collection of 450 speakers (50 speakers from each of the above nine dialect regions) will be collected from the following three regions: Sudan, Somalia, and East Africa.&nbsp; Three Arabic dialects should be collected in the Sudan, such as Sudanese, Najdi (spoken mainly in the mid-north), and Chadic Arabic (mainly spoken by Baggara and various Arabized African groups). With respect to Somalia, the following dialect groups should be collected: Northern (Standard Somali), Benaadir (Coastal Somali), and Maay (spoken by the Digil and Mirifle clans, also known as the Rahanweyn, in the southern areas of Somalia). Finally, with respect to East Africa, Swahili will need to be collected from the diaspora of three regions, such as Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda.</p>
<p>The collection should encompass one session of conversational speech in a quiet recording environment with one close microphone (within one foot of the speaker) lasting approximately 15 minutes. No personally identifiable information, such as phone numbers, birth dates, names, or addresses should be recorded. Information that must be logged with respect to each speaker includes: whether they are mono or multilingual and corresponding language proficiencies; what regions they have lived in and for how long; age, gender, education level, and occupation.</p>
<p><strong>Task II</strong>: The entire audio collection from Task 1 needs to be time-aligned and transcribed for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) training and testing. In addition, phonetic dictionaries will need to be generated for each of the three languages using either the International Phonetic Alphabet or other mutually agreed upon format.</p>
<p><strong>Task III</strong>: Provide an audio repository of at least 20 hours of a tonal language other than Mandarin, with a corresponding phonetic alphabet, and preferably from an existing database. The data is required to be time-aligned and transcribed for ASR training and testing.</p>
<p>All collections delivered have to have undergone an Institutional Review Board approval process and provide proof of this IRB concurrence or waiver to AFRL/RIGC.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: This Focus Area has a specific submission date and instructions</strong>. White paper proposals are due for submission on this task NLT 15 Jan 2016.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FURTHER NOTE</span>: <strong>For this Focus Area ONLY, the restriction on foreign participation at the prime level is waived</strong>. The restriction remains in place for all other technical requirements identified in the BAA under Funding Opportunity Description.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION III</span>, "Eligibility Requirements" is amended as follows:</p>
<p>This BAA is closed to foreign participation at the Prime Contractor level for the general technical requirements described under SECTION I, Funding Opportunity Description.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SPECIFIC TO FOCUS AREA 1/East African Language Collections ONLY:</span></strong></p>
<p>1) Foreign Participation at the Prime Contractor Level is allowed. <br />2) Foreign Participation will exclude all embargoed countries in accordance with ITAR 126.1.<br />3) All work to be performed under this Focus Area will be performed at the public domain level. Algorithms(s) that may be disclosed will be in accordance with ITAR 120.11.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION IV</span>, "Application and Submission Information", Paragraph 1/SUBMISSION DATES AND TIME, is revised as follows:</p>
<p>1. SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:</p>
<p>FY15 by 13 Mar 2015<br />FY16 by 15 Jan 2016<br />FY17 by 13 Jan 2017</p>
<p><strong>SPECIFIC TO FOCUS AREA 1: White papers must be received by 15 Jan 2016 for this area. </strong></p>
<p>White papers will be accepted until 2 PM Eastern Time on 30 September 2017, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.</p>
<p><br /><strong>No other changes have been made.</strong></p>

<DESC><strong>IFB PROJECT DETAILS: CA FLAP CR36(1), Hammonton-Smartsville Road; DTFH6815B00020</strong>&nbsp;
<p>The Hammonton-Smartsville Road project is located in the center-eastern limits of Yuba County, California. This project will provide resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation to 0.97 miles of roadway from just west of South Golden Parkway to the Hammonton-Smartsville Road/Chuck Yeager Road intersection. There will be a bid option to extend the project 0.14 miles east to include improvements to the intersection, and replacement of the existing bridge just east of the intersection with a reinforced concrete box culvert. In either case, work will be continuous for entire length of the project, with no suspensions.</p>
<p>The major work elements include full-depth reclamation of the existing road to a depth of six inches, and three inches of asphalt surfacing on a twelve-inch aggregate base. Traffic is consistently heavy all year round, with a current ADT of 2726. There will be up to 15 minute delays during construction. There will be no road closures. Weather conditions typically allow construction to commence in early Spring so as to take advantage of the dry summer construction season.</p>
<p>The project will include drainage and safety improvements, construction of a soil nail wall for slope stabilization, and MSE wall construction.</p>
<p>The primary work items are soil nail wall, MSE wall, subexcavation, full depth reclamation, aggregate base, asphalt pavement, reinforced concrete box culvert, drainage improvements, signing, and pavement markings. Significant quantities for the overall project include:</p>
<p>Line Item Unit Est. Quantity</p>
<p>Subexcavation CUYD 1,700</p>
<p>Full Depth Reclamation SQYD 16,350</p>

<DESC>Design, construct and install shelving and bins, 0040246619

1.  The following questions have been submitted by potential contractors on the subject solicitation.  Please use the answers to formulate your response.

Q.  Under Work Requirements     1. "Each bank or bay shall have 3 cross pieces to support the cores."
Under Work Requirements     2. At a minimum shelf's shall duplicate those at the other facilities.

Pictures of existing core shelf's show 1 cross member between the front and back frame members.

Question 1. Does the 3 cross members include the front and back members or is there to be 3 cross members plus the front and back frame members?

A.	The shelves have three cross members per individual shelf.  That includes the front and back cross member.  We do not require three cross members in addition to the front and back.  That would be nice but I suspect the costs of the materials would drive the cost of this project through the roof.  

As a matter of clarification, the three cross members are stipulated so that the 5' long cores are supported at the ends of each core as well as in the middle.  One person in the past when we constructed these ourselves in the late 1970's, wanted to use two cross members only because they felt the cores were rigid enough to support themselves.  But in building a test set of shelves back in 1989 after an earthquake (Loma Prieta 1989) we saw three issues: (a) the cores did sag in the middle where they were unsupported;  (b) when there are only two cross members supporting the ends of the core wasn't line up properly it could fall off one cross member and onto the shelf below it, damaging the cores; and finally (c) we live in earthquake country and the extra middle support cross member adds to stability.  In 1989 after the Loma Prieta earthquake, which shook our region catastrophically,  one of our repositories with shelves that had only two cross members failed.  One of the local USGS structural engineers told us to use three cross member for increased stability. These are extremely expensive cores to collect and preserve.  Hence, we need to preserve them for our research and require the design I show in the photos.

1. Do you require a special finish on the strut(green, galv, plain steel, Stainless)

Minimally we require a galvanized finish.  The cores are collected in salt water environments and heck they do leak and we want some protection.  Plus they are stored in a cold moist walk-in cold room and again galvanized is a minimal requirement.  Note that the photos show mostly galvanized  strut material.

2. Is there a certain type(length, diam.) of anchor bolt you require.

I can't remember how long the anchor bolts are and their diameter.  I will see if I can find some to measure when I get to Menlo Park (later this week or early next week).  If recollection serves me they are 1/2"-5/8"diameter and about 5" long.  We used the size recommended but he B-line or Unistrut representative recommended for 10' high shelving.  These are critical to structure stability.

3.Re: drawings. are your measurements from center, outside, or inside of strut. Struts are 1-5/8" wide 
They are the dimension for the specific gauge of strut I requested (I believe 12 ga). Hence the outside to outside dimension = 1-5/8"  wide.

2.  There is no change in the closing date of the solicitation.
3.  The time for the site visit is 10:00 AM.
4.  The last day to submit questions regarding this solicitation is 21 Dec 2015.
5.  All other terms and conditions remain the same.
