<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is seeking a small business to perform as a biospecimen repository facility for the competitive renewal of the Maintenance of the NHLBI Biospecimen Repository Program.  The objective of this initiative is to continue to acquire, store, and distribute quality biospecimens to the scientific community using standardized processes and procedures.  This is a five-year requirement for a repository facility that will provide long-term storage and distribution of biospecimens to the wider scientific community.  Access to the stored biospecimens and linkage to biospecimen data are coordinated by the Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC) supported by a separate contract (contract #HHSN268200800012C).  The NHLBI Biorepository Contractor collaborates with the NHLBI and the BIoLINCC Contractor to acquire new biospecimen collections and fulfill investigators' requests for biospecimens in accordance with the NHLBI Biological Specimen and Data Repository Operational Guidelines available at https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/static/guidelines/guidelines.html. It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement contract award will be made for a period of five years beginning on or about May 1, 2011. <br /><br />The Request for Proposal will contain a mandatory qualification criterion which restricts the facility to be located within the continental United States to accommodate the requirements for shipping of biological specimens to and from the facility. This acquisition is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712, Size Standard - 500 employees.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation, NHLBI-HB-11-19 will be available electronically on or about March 31, 2010 and may be accessed through the Internet at the following URL location: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities website at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov under the National Heart Lung and Blood posting section.  No paper copies will be available.  Proposals will be due on or about May 27, 2010.  Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments and for routinely checking the Internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. <br />

Changes made were minor in order to clarify questions from potential offerors.<br><br>No offeror will be excluded from the competitive range for minor or immaterial deviations from the combined synopsis/solicitation.  If necessary there will be discussions and each offeror within the competitive range will be given an  opportunity to correct any minor deficeincies and submit a best and final offer.<br><br>With regards to origin information of major components and assemblies - we are not trying to create an unreasonable burden for any offeror.  It is not necessary to disclose the origin of individual fasteners or other common parts.  Disclosing one level of manufacture is anticipated to be adequate disclosure.  If more information is required from an offeror in the competitive range, discussions will be conducted.<br><br>Some offerors wanted clarification of the reference to 13 CFR 121.406 that "there can<br>be only one manufacturer of an end item."  As a practical matter, if any<br>business concern assembles the end item of any other business concern (regardless of<br>whether or not they label it as their own or advertises it as the product of<br>another company) both business concerns cannot be considered the manufacturers of the same end item; only one business concern can be designated as its manufacturer.<br><br>Since this is a solicitation issued pursuant to Full and Open Competition and without a Small Business Set-Aside as a practical matter Title 13 does not apply.  However, since future small business set-asides are planned, our goal is to achieve some consistency and uniformity for providers when they label themselves as a manufacturer, distributor, assembler or reseller.  Generally, many providers will qualify for each label on an item by item basis.  If you have any questions concerning how we might classify you for any particular item - we will be happy to discuss the individual factors with you.  <br><br>Since this is a Full and Open Competition solicitation the request for information regarding status as a manufacturer is informative and not dispositive.<br><br>

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement contract award will be made for a period of five years beginning on or about May 1, 2011. <br /><br />The Request for Proposal will contain a mandatory qualification criterion which restricts the facility to be located within the continental United States to accommodate the requirements for shipping of biological specimens to and from the facility.
