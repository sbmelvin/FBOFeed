<DESC>Entrepreneurs and small businesses are a vital link in growing our economy, but they often do not have the financing, contacts, and history to go from innovation to implementation. 

An Office of Advocacy Issue Alert, Innovation in Small Firms (July 1986) gathered information from various sources and put small firms? role in innovation in perspective. Small businesses are efficient as innovators and produced roughly twice as many significant innovations per employee as large firms.  An estimated 55 percent of approximately 8,000 innovations can be attributed to small firms, which included innovations at different levels of significance, according to a study published by the Office of Advocacy (Characterization of Innovations Introduced on the U.S. Market in 1982, The Futures Group, March 1984, www.sba.gov/advo/research, an update of another Advocacy study, The Relationship Between Industrial Concentration, Firm Size, and Technological Innovation, Gellman Research Associates, Inc., May 1982).  However, because The Futures Group Research is dated, and the pace of technology and innovation activities has increased, it is necessary to update the study.  Another possible research angle would be to study an individual case study industry, such as information technology.  (Note that the Office of Advocacy does not maintain a list of businesses).

The proposal will show how the research will add to the existing literature on small business innovation. Also, an important part of the final report would be the link between existing and current research findings.  Fax or Emailing of proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>There were 22.4 million small businesses in the United States in 2001 (Office of Advocacy, SBA).  Of those, a considerable 72.6 percent or 16.3 million can be safely viewed as sole proprietorships (Economic Census, 1997).  The use of telecommunications should be documented, given the intensity of current debates (Tauzin-Dingell Bill before Congress, and the universal service and local competition proceedings before the Federal Communications Commission, for example) and the enormous impact that telecommunications has on small businesses.   Small businesses consume an enormous amount and variety of telecommunications services, including local landline, long distance, and wireless technologies.   Small business use of telecommunications must be accurately documented, as they are the businesses most vulnerable to the negative effects of ongoing proceedings.  Only through understanding small businesses telecommunications usage can effective advocacy on their behalf occur.

As an example, it would be useful to know what types of telecommunications services a small business uses: landlines, cellular, etc?  Within landlines, one can imagine a small business having phone lines, DSL lines, or even T1 or T3 lines.  It would be useful to know how telecommunications services are dispersed and how they differ by size (number of employees) and by location (rural or urban).

<DESC>The costs attached to litigation are relatively well documented.  The particulars with respect to the costs, such as their magnitude, and the sector(s) they affect are less well known.  Of particular interest is the magnitude of litigation costs that fall on small business.  There were 22.4 million small businesses in the United States in 2001 (Office of Advocacy, SBA).  Of those, a considerable 72.6 percent or 16.3 million can be safely viewed as sole proprietorships (Economic Census, 1997).  The majority, if not the totality of sole proprietorships is small.  What are their litigation costs?  Case studies could be used to reiterate the data findings.

A White House study, Who Pays for Tort Liability Claims? An Economic Analysis of the U.S. Tort Liability System, April 2002, actually equates tort claims to a tax on individuals and businesses.  Citing a study by Tillinghast-Towers Perrin (U.S. Tort Costs: 2000, Trends and Findings on the Costs of the U.S. Tort System, Feb. 2002), the report suggests that the U.S. tort system cost $179 billion in 2000.  That figure most likely understates the true estimate of costs for at least two reasons: (a) it cannot include the many externalities attached to such disbursements, and (b) more important, tort costs are a subset of litigation costs.

<DESC>Benefits are a major component of employee compensation, but costs to businesses to provide benefits can differ.  This research would capture the cost differences between small and large firms.  Potential sources of data for analysis include trade association data, information from the Current Population Survey, and other sources.  However, the limitations of available data may force researchers into investigating the possibility of generating data from the Internal Revenue Service, Statistics of Income.

This study is needed because a main source for employee benefits statistics comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and BLS has information only by size of establishment, not firm, making the information unusable for firm-size studies.  Of particular interest are very small employers.  Fax or Email proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>Veteran business owners are a group of business owners that deserve particular attention.  Unfortunately, data available for this group are limited.  Currently, some lists of businesses containing veteran status exist, such as D&B, however, the information maybe incomplete.  A possible avenue of research is to match lists of business owners from various data sources to try to determine the quality of available information.  Potential data sources are the National Survey of Veterans (http://www.va.gov/vetdata/SurveyResults/index.htm), and various lists from veterans? groups. The researchers will need to indicate that they have secured access to the business lists in their proposals.  

An alternative proposal would be to confirm the veteran status and the quality of the data in D&B or some other data list.  A last avenue would be to search for potential data sources on veteran business owners and state the data sources strengths and weaknesses.  Fax or Emailing of proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>There were 22.4 million small businesses in the United States in 2001 (Office of Advocacy, SBA).  Of those, a considerable 72.6 percent or 16.3 million can be safely viewed as sole proprietorships (Economic Census, 1997).  Total federal taxes account for 21 percent of Gross Domestic Product, and the federal tax rules span 45,662 pages (CCH Inc. Standard Federal Tax Reporter, 2001).  It is often suggested that the tax code unfairly targets specific forms of legal organizations.

The US Internal Revenue Code (IRC) contains numerous tax and tax credit provisions affecting the operation and after-tax profits of large and small businesses. The distributional effects of these taxes and tax credit provisions among small and large firms have not been well investigated. Given the complexity of the tax code and the high costs of tax administration and compliance; the conclusion that small businesses wind up being unfairly targeted should come as no surprise.  Is the federal tax code effectively a barrier to entry and success for small businesses?  Do small businesses have access to the breaks to which they are legislatively entitled? What is small businesses? share of the selected major tax expenditure items? The Joint Committee on Taxation and the Office of Tax Administration have authored tax expenditure studies, and the IRS?s Statistics of Income contain data showing firms broken down by size and their use of  tax expenditure items.  In addition, it is also useful to know the effect of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) on the ability of small business owners to utilize various tax credits. 

Of particular interest is the tax policy distortions caused for very small businesses and new businesses.  Case studies could be used to reiterate the data findings.  Fax or Emailing of proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>Small businesses rely primarily on banks for their external financing. With the banking structure experiencing major changes during the past decade as banks become larger and banking assets are increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small number of giant bank holding companies (BHC), it is important to investigate small business lending behaviors and lending performance of these large banks.  The availability of three major data sources on small business lending, namely the call reports, CRA reports, the Survey of Small Business Finances, and other data sources permits a careful investigation of this important issue. 

Anyone bidding on this proposals is expected to demonstrate familiarity with conducting research and knowledge of the data source(s).  If the research requires the use of internal data from the Federal Reserve Board, cooperation from the research staff of the Federal Reserve Board must be arranged.  Fax and emailing of proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) conducted its first national survey of the public's attitudes and behaviors regarding drinking and driving in 1991.  This survey provided data on several topic areas including: personal consumption, drinking and driving frequency, intervention measures, perceived threat of drinking and driving, perceived consequences of drinking and driving, and opinions on enforcement and penalties.  Since 1991, NHTSA has continued to track the nature and scope of the drinking driver problem by administering a national survey every two years.  The most recent biennial drinking and driving survey was administered in 2001.  The findings from this survey are scheduled to become available by the end of calendar 2002.  The objectives of this project are to: (1) Measure the current status of attitudes, knowledge, and behavior of the general driving public regarding drinking, and driving after drinking; and, (2) Identify the nature and extent of changes in these attitudes, knowledge, and behavior that have occurred over the course of six biennial drinking and driving surveys (1991 through 2001).
This requirement requires the administration of a national telephone survey to measure the attitudes and behaviors of the general driving age public, and to track the changes that have occurred over this and the five previous drinking and driving surveys.  The survey instrument to be used will be a revised version of that used in the 2001 survey.  Prior to administration of the survey, the contractor shall perform revisions to the questionnaire based on guidance provided by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).  The contractor shall also be responsible for analysis of the data and for preparation of the final reports that describes the background, methods and findings. A cost reimbursable type contract is anticipated with a period of performance of nineteen (19) months for the 2003 survey with two nineteen (19) month options.  Electronic copies of this solicitation will be available on the GSA's Electronic Posting System (EPS), located on the Internet at http://www.esp.gov.  Requests for paper copies must be in writing to the NHTSA address above.  The anticipated issuance date is May 30, 2002.

I. OBJECTIVE

To assist the Government of Honduras (GOH) and USAID/Honduras in the identification and implementation of sound economic policies and secondary cities business and agribusiness development strategies under the Productivity and Policy Enhancement Program (PROPEP); participate in the initiation, coordination and monitoring of actions required for that purpose; and assist the Mission's Strategic Objective 1 (SO1) team to identify, design, implement and monitor other activities related to the development of agribusiness and the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector in Honduras.

II.  BACKGROUND

Since 1994, USAID'S Agriculture and Natural Resources Office (ANRO) has employed a USPSC to assist with the implementation of its Policy Analysis and Implementation Project (PAIP) in the agricultural sector.  In 1995 responsibilities for the position were expanded to include, in addition to agriculture sector policy issues, broader economic policy issues and closer involvement with the public and private sector organizations. Over the last two years close working relationships have been established with the Presidential Policy Analysis Unit (UNAT), Ministries of Agriculture and Commerce (SAG and SIC), the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH), the National Statistics Institute (INA), the Honduran Council of Private Enterprise (COHEP), and the Honduran Foundation for Investment for the Development of Exports (FIDE). 

The policy work initiated under the PAIP project is now being continued under the Productivity and Policy Enhancement Program (PROPEP).  PROPEP was designed to advance the Mission's Strategic Objective (SO) 1, Expanded and Equitable Access to Productive Resources and Markets.  It has two components.  The component one contributes to improve Honduran economic policies conducive to poverty reduction (RP1.1), while the second component seeks to improve market access and competitiveness (RP1.2).  Chemonics International and the four subcontractors (IMCC, MSI, Austin Associates, and  FIDE), Carana Corporation, Accion International, Aid to Artisans, Covelo Foundation, FHIA, FINTRAC and LOL are primary implementers of activities under this program.

<DESC>POC:  Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel:  703-875-4357, Fax:  703-875-4009, E-mail:  ekunene@tda.gov  :  DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place  :  Mr. Liu Weixing, Shenzhen Metro Company, Limited, 9/F Touzi Mansion, No. 4009 Shennan Ave., Futian District, Shenzhen, CHINA 518026, Phone: 86-755-8351-2144, Fax: 86-755-8393-8059  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study and tender documents for Shenzhen Metro Company, Limited.  The feasibility study will outline the technical standards and system requirements for Phase II of the Shenzhen metro system in the city of Shenzhen, China.  

The official population of Shenzhen, located a few kilometers from Hong Kong, is around 2 million.  However, there are nearly 4 million temporary registered workers and another 1 million people who ?float? between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, bringing the actual population of the city closer to 7 million people.  The increasing traffic between Hong Kong and Shenzhen has raised the need for better transportation infrastructure for the city.  To address this need, the State Development Planning Commission formally approved the construction of a metro system for Shenzhen in 1998.  The first phase of the project is currently under construction.  Phase 1 involves the construction of a 19.5 km main line.  Of this total, 15 km will be composed of the eastern portion of Line 1 and 4.5 km will be on the southern portion of Line 4.  These portions were selected in order to facilitate transit with Hong Kong by connecting to existing rail access points between the two cities.  Along the Phase 1 lines, 18 stations are planned.  The Phase 1 construction began in March 2001 and is expected to be complete by the end of 2004 at a cost of approximately $1.3 billion.  

While the construction of Phase I is proceeding on schedule, the Shenzhen Metro officials are looking ahead for preparation of Phase II of the network?s development.  Phase II is planned to cover over 30 km with 22 stations.  Lines 1 and 4 are expected to be extended, providing greater access to inland communities along Line 4 as well as ferry ports along the western portions of Line 1.  Shenzhen officials hope to complete Phase II preparations by 2003 and commence construction by February 2004 with eventual full operations to begin in February 2008.  The total estimated cost of Phase II is $1.8 billion.

After the experience of Phase I preparations, Shenzhen Metro officials are aware of the importance of adequate preparatory studies.  Phase II of the metro expansion is a larger project than Phase I and requires significant study and research.  To assist in efforts to prepare for Phase II metro development, Shenzhen officials seek both a feasibility study and procurement technical assistance, to analyze the financial, technical, economic, and environmental considerations associated with Phase II metro development and tender preparation.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $743,810 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M. Local Time, SEPTEMBER 9, 2002, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The economic costs of starting a business include explicit and implicit costs. Explicit costs are the time and money spent to acquire market information, comply with government regulations, and search for labor. Implicit costs comprise the foregone earnings that the entrepreneur would otherwise have made from wage employment. 

The purpose of this study is to identify economic barriers of starting a business, explore how and why entrepreneurs choose to start their own businesses, examine the correlation of startup costs and the business cycle and search for strategies that reduce startup costs. Special attention needs to be given to different types of businesses, sizes, and industries.

Research proposals should include a set of hypotheses to be tested, the model to be applied, and the data to be used for testing the model.  If available data sources are deemed unable to be used for this study, the researcher can collect primary data from small businesses.  Also, an important part of the final report would be the link between existing and current research findings.  Case studies could be used to reiterate the data findings.  No Fax or emailing of proposals will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Laboratory of Neurobiology (LN) plans to procure a Proscan 2kx2k Slow-Scan CCD Camera System with LEO Electron Microscopy Inc., One Zeiss Way, Thornwood, NY 10594.  The supplies and services herein are defined as commercial and is being prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. The Laboratory of Neurobiology is responsible for investigating the fundamental cell biology of synaptic transmission, intracellular transport and the organization of specialized membranes in neurons.  An important component of these studies concerns calcium regulation in neuronal processes and the molecular organization of intracellar assemblies.  One of the LN's main instruments for this research is a LEO 912 energy-filtering transmission electron microscope, whose capabilities for low-dose, quantitative imaging, energy filtering, and cryoelectron microscopy are greatly enhanced by a Proscan low-noise, scientific-grade CCD camera interfaced to the microscope. This contract is to upgrade the original camera to 2kx2k model with an up-to-date level of performance and attendant improvements in efficiency and productivity. The new 2kx2k camera will be installed on and interfaced to an existing LEO 912 Omega energy-filtering electron microscope.  The following objectives will be accomplished: 1) a major increase in capability for experiments involving rapidly frozen neuronal specimens because (a) the greatly enlarged field of view deriving from a 4x increase in the number of pixels leads to reduced specimen damage (fewer exposures required), and because (b) the smaller pixel size (14 um) allows higher resolution images and; 2) an increase in research productivity, because substantial efficiency follows from manipulating, analyzing and interpreting many fewer images.  LEO Electron Microscope is the only source known to NINDS that can supply the instrument that is fully compatible with the mechanical, hardware, and software environment of the existing LEO 912 Omega electron microscope.  Specific unique features include the optimized (and pre-existing) mounting flange which minimized undesirable post-specimen magnification, and a clean and bug-free interface to the suite of Windows-based custom control and processing software routines that are critical to the coordination of camera and microscope and are available only from LEO.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.   The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington DC time) on August 5, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax at 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement bases on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

Background: Ovarian cancer is the 5th most frequently diagnosed cancer in women with an overall 5 year relative survival rate of about 53%.  In addition to stage of disease at diagnosis, primary and adjuvant treatments are important prognostic factors, but few women receive treatment consistent with guidelines.  Provider characteristics, and in particular, physician specialty has been reported to be associated with receipt of treatment for other tumor sites.  Few studies have explored the role of physician speciality in ovarian cancer patterns of care and outcomes.  This study will explore the role of physician speciality in patterns of care for ovarian cancer and the role of initial care in ovarian cancer morbidity and survival outcomes.  Findings from this study may be used to identify issues in the quality of ovarian cancer care that need to be studied by the NCI and improve patterns of referral for women with ovarian cancer.  The work for this project will utilize linked SEER-Medicare claims data to access the role of physician specialty on patterns of care for ovarian cancer as well as ovarian cancer morbidity and survival.  The SEER Medicare claims data will be used to explore care and treatment outcomes. Minimum Requirements: 1) perform analyses to explore the association between physician speciality and patterns of care and the role of initial care in ovarian cancer morbidity and mortality outcome by state of disease at diagnosis; 2) access claims-based measures of comorbidity and identify and implement the most appropriate measure for this project; 3) identify and implement a mechanism for defining disease recurrence and morbidity after surgery; 4) identify and implement analytic technique for addressing non-random referral patterns for patients diagnoses with ovarian cancer to specific physicians and hospitals, 5) Contractor must hold a medical degree with board certification in oncology, 6) must have been a medical doctor for a minimum of 5 years with no less than 2 years experience in health services research using the SEER-Medicare data and, 7) must be familiar with and have a favorable understanding of measuring comorbidity using administrative data.   Dr. Earle  is uniquely qualified to provide these services being a nationally recognized expert in the field of SEER- Medicare claims data to explore patterns of care and treatment outcomes.  He has also led a project using these data and instrumental variable and propensity score analysis to access the effectiveness of chemotherapy for lung cancer.  Dr. Earle's expertise with SEER- Medicare claims data as well as these analytic methods for cancer-related health services research provides him with the unique skills to perform this work.   The period of performance shall be for a period of six (6) months.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, including all techniques and demonstrated expertise, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 5, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcrafm@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.

<DESC>NA U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, White Sands Contracting Division, Building 126W Crozier Street, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, intends to a sole-source award for completion of Software Specific Database Entry of the Network Management S ystem of the Test Support Network at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.  Award will be made by modification to contract DATM05-01-P-0107. The contractor will provide subject matter expert on specific Enterprise Solution software to Building 335, White Sands Missile Range, to work with and train government personnel on the data entry requirements of the Enterprise Solution software package as  specific to WSMR needs and requirements to develop a working NMS Inventory Management, Service Request and Activation function, and billing within the NMS of the Test Support Network. The original award was a sole-source, SBA 8(a) contract for the Network  Management System to ABBA Technologies.  Modification P00001 added an option to provide a subject matter expert on specific Enterprise Solution software be made available on site at Building 335 White Sands Missile Range to work with and train government personnel on the data entry requirements of the Enterprise Solution software package as specific to WSMR needs and requirements to develop a working NMS Inventory Management, Service Request and Activation function, and billing within the NMS of the Test S upport Network (TSN).  Modification P00002 funded that option.  The current requirement is for a continuation of those option services for another 6 months at less than $250,000.  For this type of short-term (6 months) follow-on effort, ABBA Technologies i s the only contractor available with people, skills, licenses, equipment and experience in place to meet the immediate requirement in a timely, and cost efficient manner.  Also, services are performed on an intermittent basis, as the need arises.  There wo uld be a substantial duplication of cost for another contractor to mobilize for this short time period.  The expert is actually a sole-source subcontractor currently in place.  New agreements would have to be negotiated.  The solicitation process, coupled with the mobilization requirements would cause an unacceptable delays in fulfilling the TSN requirements.

BACKGROUND
	The Fishery Sampling Branch of the National Marine Fisheries Service's Northeast Fisheries Science Center oversees the placement of fishery observers on commercial fishing vessels.  The placement of these observers may be required by various federal laws, most notably the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and the Endangered Species Act (ESA).   Additionally, the presence of observers is mandated by various fishery management plans (FMP's) and by some Atlantic coastal states' fishery regulations.  The industry, in general, is aware of the program and its function but this understanding does not always extend to the docks and the individual vessels.  The objective of this requirement is to develop materials to educate the industry (at the vessel level) of the program's mission and objectives as well as the authority under which NEFSC operates.  Additionally,  a kiosk display needs to be developed to present at trade shows and fish expo's in order to attain wide dissemination of the program's story to the public and fishing industry.
	
SCOPE OF WORK
	Through consultations with the Fishery Sampling Branch staff at Woods Hole, the contractor shall design and prepare various hand-out materials suitable for presentation to the industry to educate them on the Observer Program's objectives and goals. 

	One document shall cover the basic Observer Program, its development, purpose, and legislative mandates.  This document shall be several pages long and prepared as a brochure.  Other documents shall focus on specific fisheries, and/or specific Fisheries Management Plans that require observers.  This would include, but not be limited to, Gillnet, Trawl, Seine, and Long-line Fisheries.  These documents shall be prepared as one (1) double-sided, laminated document which is suitable for observers to take along on vessels.  These hand-outs shall be directed towards the industry in situations which have not typically had observer coverage or in situations where compliance has been an issue. 

	Excerpts from the handouts shall be consolidated into a traveling kiosk to be used by NMFS at various trade shows and fish expo's along the east coast.

DELIVERABLES AND TIME TABLE

June 1st		Initial meeting between NMFS and vendor to begin discussions to gather information and visuals for preparation of the documents.

August 1st		Draft documents are presented for NMFS review

September 15th	Final versions of documents and the Kiosk are presented

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals in the source selection process. When appropriate potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Kathy Cames, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 478-926-1922. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.

<DESC>The following questions were submitted and responses are as follows:

1.  What is the quantity of master and slave nodes in the cluster? I see that they are looking for cables for 18 systems but there is no mention of how many nodes of each type. I would expect it is 1 master, 16 slaves and 1 management terminal but wanted to be sure.   

Ans:  We require that the system have 1 master and 16 slave dual processor nodes.  As for the management terminal, the 17? monitor, a keyboard, and mouse will be connected directly to the cluster and reside next to it.  A second terminal system is required and will not be configured as part of the cluster system.  This second terminal will be used as a workstation and will access the cluster via the lab network.


2.  The memory module specified in the description is PC800 and that is RAMBUS, however the Tyan S2720GN uses DDR memory instead. 

Ans:  That was a typo.  PC800 ECC DDR should be replaced with PC2100 ECC DDR.


3.  1) How many slave nodes are required?  2) Is the equipment to reside in 1 Rack?  

Ans:  The cluster will have 1 master node and 16 slave dual processor nodes.  Yes, the cluster should reside on a single rack.

<CONTACT>Rick Murray, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 366-4250, Fax (202) 366-3705, Email rick.murray@fhwa.dot.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION:  The Federal Highway Administration, in association with the US Coast Guard, National Geodetic Survey, and several other government agencies, is implementing a High Accuracy - Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (HA-NDGPS) capability for test purposes at the Hagerstown, MD, Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS) facility.

HANDGPS CONFIGURATION:  The current planned configuration is broadcasting carrier phase data on a second low frequency (454 kHz), while maintaining the existing NDGPS broadcast at 307kHz.  To achieve this, carrier phase information is collected from one of the existing NDGPS reference receivers and packaged appropriately.  This data stream is provided to a new modulator with this modulated signal fed to a new transmitter.  This signal is then diplexed onto the existing NDGPS tower and broadcast at a frequency of 454 kHz.  

DATA AVAILABLE:  It was our intention to make receivers available for short periods of time to interested parties (reference ?Request for Testers of a High Accuracy Differential GPS HANDGPS) System? 17 January, 2002).  Since these receivers are not yet available, we have opted to make some of the raw data available.  The data can be found at ftp://www.ngs.noaa.gov/dist/HA-NDGPS/test101a.02.  The data may also be accessed by going to ftp www.ngs.noaa.gov, using the login: ftp, entering your e-mail  address as the password and going to directory  dist/HA-NDGPS/test101a.02. Please read file ha-ndgps.data.doc  for specific contents of the files.

POC:  If you have any questions concerning this program or need assistance in accessing the data, please contact Mr. Jim Arnold, FHWA, (202)493-3265, james.a.arnold@fhwa.dot.gov.

BACKGROUND
	The Fishery Sampling Branch of the National Marine Fisheries Service's Northeast Fisheries Science Center oversees the placement of fishery observers on commercial fishing vessels.  The placement of these observers may be required by various federal laws, most notably the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and the Endangered Species Act (ESA).   Additionally, the presence of observers is mandated by various fishery management plans (FMP's) and by some Atlantic coastal states' fishery regulations.  The industry, in general, is aware of the program and its function but this understanding does not always extend to the docks and the individual vessels.  The objective of this requirement is to develop materials to educate the industry (at the vessel level) of the program's mission and objectives as well as the authority under which NEFSC operates.  Additionally,  a kiosk display needs to be developed to present at trade shows and fish expo's in order to attain wide dissemination of the program's story to the public and fishing industry.
	
SCOPE OF WORK
	Through consultations with the Fishery Sampling Branch staff at Woods Hole, the contractor shall design and prepare various hand-out materials suitable for presentation to the industry to educate them on the Observer Program's objectives and goals. 

	One document shall cover the basic Observer Program, its development, purpose, and legislative mandates.  This document shall be several pages long and prepared as a brochure.  Other documents shall focus on specific fisheries, and/or specific Fisheries Management Plans that require observers.  This would include, but not be limited to, Gillnet, Trawl, Seine, and Long-line Fisheries.  These documents shall be prepared as one (1) double-sided, laminated document which is suitable for observers to take along on vessels.  These hand-outs shall be directed towards the industry in situations which have not typically had observer coverage or in situations where compliance has been an issue. 

	Excerpts from the handouts shall be consolidated into a traveling kiosk to be used by NMFS at various trade shows and fish expo's along the east coast.

DELIVERABLES AND TIME TABLE

June 1st		Initial meeting between NMFS and vendor to begin discussions to gather information and visuals for preparation of the documents.

August 1st		Draft documents are presented for NMFS review

September 15th	Final versions of documents and the Kiosk are presented
THIS MODIFICATION IS ISSUED TO FORWARD AMENDMENT NO. 0001 WHEREIN
THE HOUR AND DATE SPECIFIED FOR RECEIPT OF OFFERS IS EXTENDED TO 4:30 P.M., 05/28/2002.

<DESC>DARPA's Advanced Technology Office (ATO) intends to enter into sole source negotiations with Shared Spectrum Company to determine the utilization of the RF spectrum in the vicinity of several sites inclusive of DoD test ranges within the continental United States for use in the development of spectrum access technology.  The measurements will cover bands from 54 MHz to 3,000 MHz to document spectrum usage technical characteristics.  The measurement locations will be proposed for approval to the DARPA PM.  Locations will include, but not be limited to, the regions surrounding Pax River NAS, Edwards AFB, Eglin AFB, and White Sands Missile Range. 

The measurements will be constructed to identify large temporal and spatial spectrum holes and will consider a wide range of user characteristics (high power, low power, high duty cycle, low duty cycle, omni-antennas, and directional antennas).  A single point, contractor furnished measurement system will be used. The measurements will include a combination of non-simultaneous ground and airborne spectrum measurements, with each measurement period lasting at hours and with measurements repeated over multiple days to obtain statistically valid samples.  This announcement is not a request for proposals, or an RFP of any kind.

<DESC>NA The Pacific Regional Contracting Office (PRCO), Tripler Army Medical Center is hereby amending subject solicitation and extending the closing date to 10:00 A.M. HST., 7/24/02.  Amendment 0002 is hereby incorporated using questions and replies as a method t o clarify the statement of work which will help the Pacific Regional Contracting Office receive a reply to this solicitation. QUESTION:   Regarding the level of experience, does the word “contractor” mean the firm/company or individual?  A check with “The American Institute of Architects” in Washington DC has indicated that the total years expressed in this solicitation for a specific firm m aybe overly stringent.  A check of their database indicates that only one of their registered members throughout the United States could qualify to bid this contract.  Further, the requirements for individual architects and mechanical engineers performing similar this type work directly on a contract in a commercial environment would normally be in the 3 to 8 year range. ANSWER  Individual(s) on site visit must have the years of experience that is specified in the solicitation.  American Institute of Architects (AIA) membership is not a requirement of this solicitation. QUESTION: The amendment states, “At least two (2) years experience as a JCAHO Surveyor.  Please provide a statement defining the government’s definition of “Surveyor”?  In a commercial environment, that particular definition is synonymous with “Inspector”.  Also ple ase clarify what government certifications are required to be a Surveyor for this solicitation? ANSWER:  A surveyor must have had experience as a Joint Commission Accreditation Hospital Surveyor.  The term surveyor & inspector are used synonymously. QUESTION: The Amendment states, “…with respect to Plant, Technology, and Safety Management Fire Safety/Life Safety codes…”  For your information, the term “Plant, Technology and Safety Management (PTSM) standards” were phased out in 1996 and are now called the “Envi ronment of Care”.  Will the latest codes/standards apply to this solicitation? ANSWER: Yes, latest code/standard applies. QUESTION: The Amendment states, “…requirements to include at least five years of experience in teaching, evaluating, and implementing Life Safety Code requirements and the JCAHO Environment of Care Standard.  Is there a new requirement to teach JCAHO Environment of Care?  How many times will the class be taught?  How many students will attend?  Will all seven management areas be taught?  These will be required as they are additional requirements that we shall need to price. ANSWER: Appropriate staff needed to train in EOC requirement. The number of classes required will be determined during the site visit. Number of students will vary. Seven (7) management areas will be taught. No certificate is required from military school. QUESTION: The Amendment states, “This on-going JCAHO assessment incorporates an on-going review and assessment of the seven-management areas and associated Management Plans required by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospital Organizations.”  The requir ements for this solicitation appear to be focused on specifically on medical facility management, while the Seven Management Plans cover all areas of healthcare in a hospital.  Is this requirement for Facility Management only or will all seven areas need t o be addressed? ANSWER: Seven areas of management need to be addressed. QUESTION:  The Amendment states, “Micro station CAD files are available and will be provided prior to the first visit to the facility.”  What standard/software will be required to produce new drawings?  We understand that the AMEDD will be deploying DMLSS to all medi cal facilities and the standard AutoCAD software will be Draw base.   ANSWER:  AutoCad/Microstation convertible to Drawbase. QUESTION: The Amendment states, “At least seven (7) years of experience ensuring successful JCAHO Environment of Care  compliance for Army Healthcare facility.”  Why only Army Healthcare and US Army experience?  All DOD and Commercial Hospitals have the same requirements and are operated throughout the country under the same standards. Can Department of the Air Force/Navy  and /or commercial hospital experience be substituted? ANSWER: Army Healthcare & Army experience is required.  Hospitals are unique with different rules and regulations. QUESTION:  The Amendment also stated changes to travel, but only addresses Tripler.  Has travel requirements to Camp Zama also been changed or were they dropped entirely. Please provide clarification as to the number of trips required to each location (Tripler and Ca mp Zama), and the expected number of people to attend each visit for each location. ANSWER: Statement of specific tasks still apply as stated in the solicitation.  Trip to Camp Zama is still required annually.   (End of Summary of Changes)

It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to cancel this solicitation and procure the Digital Voice Logging Recorder Systems on current Government contracts.  Through the government's research and inquiries, it was determined that capacity within current Government contracts already in-place, augmented by in-house capabilities, would enable NAWCAD St. Inigoes to fulfill the Air Force requirements.  It was determined that canceling the solicitation was both within the Government's rights and should not be a burden to industry.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) to provide services to expand technical assistance and data collection support to the State Partnership Initiative (SPI) projects in Iowa and New York and add an additional SPI project in Mississippi that will be providing transition services to youth.   VCU has a contract with SSA to provide technical assistance and data collection support to SPI and Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) projects throughout the country.  SSA will be expanding two of the projects to add one additional group of target participants, youth ages 11 to 21, the transition/employment interventions needed for that group, and one more state dealing solely with the youth population.  These services for a new target population and State are an extension of the services currently being provided.  VCU is the only known organization with the subject expertise and familiarity with the issues to provide the required technical assistance and data collection support.  VCU is providing data collection support and conducting process evaluations for the SPI project.  They have created a database for the data collection.  All projects are reporting with the same format and database.  VCU is fully versed in all the tasks required by this request as they are currently providing technical assistance to the SPI/RSA projects throughout the country.   The period of performance will be through the expiration of the contract which is September 28, 2003.  SSA knows of no other source that has the capability to satisfy all of the requirements for this modification.  Interested parties that believe they have the capability to perform the services required should submit a capability statement to Barbara F. Hands or Loretta Hawley by mail to: SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, 1710 GWYNN OAK AVENUE, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND 21207; by email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov or loretta.hawley@ssa.gov; or by fax to 410-966-9310.

All questions must be submitted in writing to the mailing address or email address listed above and marked to the attention of Barbara F. Hands or Loretta Hawley.

<SUBJECT>66 -- High Cycle Fatigue Test System-Release of Draft PBSOW for Industry Comments
<DESC>The Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility (PSEF), at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division in Patuxent River, MD is responsible for conducting test and evaluation of fan, compressor and hot section rotating components used in military gas turbine engines to determine life-limiting characteristics.  The PSEF?s Rotor Spin Facility (RSF)  has been designated a Department of Defense Center of Excellence for spin testing of military gas turbine engine components.  Current test capability of the RSF is limited to the determination of low cycle fatigue impact on life expectancy of rotating components. The use of advance aerodynamic designs and materials in high performance engines has increased the risk of High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) failures.  Successful completions of a number of Government contracts and independent corporate research efforts have demonstrated the capability to provide dynamic excitation of gas turbine airfoils to fatigue levels in a vacuum spin chamber.  Concurrent with the development of the excitation system has been the development of a Non-intrusive Stress Measurement System to measure very small amplitudes of all the airfoils of the rotor while rotating at high speeds.  With these advancements, it is now possible to assemble a system capable of simulating a stress environment in a vacuum spin chamber, measuring rotor/airfoil stresses and assessing the effects of these stresses on component life with respect to high cycle fatigue at conditions simulating the rotor?s operating environment.  The Navy at Patuxent River would like to take advantage of these technological advances to procure a High Cycle Fatigue Test System.  Our objective is to obtain a state-of-the-art High Cycle Fatigue Test System using proven technological capabilities.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Currently we have a draft Performance Based Statement of Work (PBSOW) for this requirement and are looking for comments from experts in this field.  In addition, please provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost for the High Cycle Fatigue System as you understand it from the PBSOW.  It is understood that this ROM has an accuracy of +/-30% and will only be used for budgetary purposes.  A draft of the PBSOW can be obtained for review, comments and suggestions by contacting Ms. Rachel Luther via phone (301) 757-9711, fax (301) 757-0200, or e-mail lutherrn@navair.navy.mil or through the NAVAIR Solicitation page at http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm under N00421-02-T-0129.  Comments and suggestions are due in writing by 02 August 2002.  They should be forwarded by mail to: Contracts, Attn: Rachel Luther ? 251717 Bldg 588 S2, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, 47253 Whalen Rd Unit 9, Patuxent River MD 20670-1463; by e-mail to lutherrn@navair.navy.mil; OR by fax to (301) 757-0200.  This draft PBSOW does not obligate the Government to award a contract for a High Cycle Fatigue Test System nor does this letter authorize you to bill the Government for your review and comments on our draft requirement.

<DESC>A.  INTRODUCTION.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/VSE-B), Kirtland AFB NM, is interested in receiving proposals (technical and cost) on research to advance and demonstrate the technologies required to enable an advanced missile Guidance, Navigation and Control system, and other closely related Ballistic Missile technologies.  The total program budget for these efforts is approximately $53.2 million over five years.  The government anticipates making up to four (4) contract awards but reserves the right to make more or less than four (4) awards based on the evaluation criteria specified.  Funds are not presently available for this effort.  Offerors are advised to contact the technical point of contact to verify interest in the effort to be proposed and funding availability PRIOR to committing resources to the preparation of proposals in response to this announcement. 
B.  REQUIREMENTS.  Proposals are desired for advanced Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) system designs and technologies that could lead to an integrated system for flight demonstration.  The research area of interest is enabling GNC technologies for missile boost, post-boost, and terminal phases.  Proposals for technologies which could enable future ballistic systems with enhanced GNC performance, reliability, maintainability, supportability, and affordability goals and which enhance performance and significantly reduce cost, schedule, or risk of existing technologies are of interest.  
Future GNC systems for advanced ballistic missile lift and reentry systems must perform to increasingly more demanding requirements for: 1) affordable, lower cost, 2) higher precision weapon deployment and targeting accuracy, 3) minimization of size and power, 4) immunity to space like hostile environments, 5) high mean time between failures and 6) robust units requiring minimal hands-on maintenance and environmental conditioning.  The technologies needed to meet the anticipated strategic navigation, guidance and control requirements of the 2020 timeframe and beyond may be considered a revolutionary change from the current state-of-the-art fielded systems.  These systems would satisfy the strategic requirements for the Air Force and Navy and also meet the size, weight, power and cost requirements of the precision strike initiatives.  The technical challenge will be to develop the GNC technology to obtain the high precision sensors required for strategic applications, while keeping the cost, size, weight and power low enough to support nonstrategic applications.  The envisioned performance goals are on the order of 0.01 degree/hr bias drift rate, with a scale factor error of 0.4 ppm for gyros, and a 1 micro-g bias stability with a scale factor error of 1 ppm for accelerometers with aiding by jam-resistant GPS technology.
Work performed under any resulting contract may be classified up to the Secret Level. The DD 254 is attached hereto.  The contractor(s) who is/are selected for an award under this PRDA may be required and then must be eligible to obtain a Secret facility clearance. Technical point of contact: AFRL/VSE-B, Dr. Sandra H. Slivinsky, 505-846-7222, fax 505-846-5589, email sandra.slivinsky@kirtland.af.mil.  Open communication with the technical POC is encouraged until proposals are received. 
C. PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  Proposals shall be due 45 days from the date of this announcement.
