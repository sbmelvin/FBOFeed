1. Background
 In summary, this includes a through description of the Unclassified Organizational Server that makes force structure data available for integration and use by other programs of record that use force structure data, and all the Architectural Views of GFM. Procedurally speaking, the Unclassified Org Server data is passed to the Classified Organizational Servers and augments the classified force structure data that includes the Combatant Commander (COCOM) command relationships used to document the force assignment process. The force structure data includes specifications and authorizations for personnel and equipment as well as unit identification data. Additional pertinent background information for this task is provided at the Joint URL https://www.intelink.gov/wiki/Global_Force_Management_Data_Initiative/CCB#Operational_Baseline_v1.1.  GFM Capability Development Document, Technical Specifications, Operational Baselines, Overviews, CONOPS, and Implementation Plans can be fou! nd there.
2.  System Overview
The Air Force Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM DI), enables Defense Readiness Reporting System/Global Visibility Capability, Adaptive Planning, Defense Integrated Military Human Resource System, and Standard Financial Information Structure to integrate organizational and force structure data across the Department of Defense. The end goal of the GFM DI is to integrate the three force management processes (assignment, allocation and apportionment), and ensure the data is available to meet the needs of all users, systems and functions.  This task is the sustainment, maintenance and modification of the current classified and unclassified AF GFM DI that includes implementation of the Global Force Management Information Exchange Data Model, (GFMIEDM), 3.5 changes. The Global Force Management Information Exchange Data Model (GFMIEDM) is the information exchange specification that supports data integration within and among the Services' Organizational Servers (each branc! h of the Service has an Organizational Server), and provides information to external systems. Further, to enable data integration and de-confliction across the Org Servers, and provide utility for applications outside the Org Servers, the tagging of all authorized force structure data with unambiguous, unique identifiers is a necessity. Force Management Identifiers (FMIDS), serve this function for all data within the GFMIEDM, and thus all data within the Org Servers (including organizations, materiel authorizations, personnel authorizations, and relationships and associations between these entities). The GFMIEDM version 3.5 contains 46 different entities that cover the minimum essential force structure data understood as necessary to fulfill Global Force Management. The inter-relational generalized hierarchy of the data specification provides for the unique identification of all GFMIEDM data with a set of FMIDS comprising twelve attributes. Note:  GFMIEDM found at the URL h! ttps://www.intelink.gov/wiki/Global_Force_Management_Data_Initiative/CCB#Operational_Baseline_v1.1.  
2.1   A major deficiency in data sharing across the enterprise is the lack of a common reference standard across information technology domains and business processes. A basic premise of GFM DI is that force structure is the common element between almost all DOD warfighting and business systems and that the development of a methodology to create an authoritative data source for authorized force structure will provide the means to accomplish GFM objectives. The Department established GFM DI to fill gaps in the capability to provide visibility of the entire force structure as a function of time: past, present, and future. The three components of the GFM Data Strategy include documenting the authorized force structure for all organizations, uniquely identifying force structure data elements, and disseminating the force structure data for use throughout the Department. Key elements in implementing GFM DI include identifying authorization data, establishing an organizational hierarchy to build a single force structure, developing an information exchange model to provide standard formats, and establishing requirements for GFM Organization Servers that will become the authoritative data sources for force structure authorization data. The mission of the AF GFM-DI is to support the warfighter by providing timely, reliable, and authoritative force management data in a net-centric environment.  This data may be used to enhance the situat! ional awareness of decision-makers and other authorized users and to facilitate a more rapid and accurate means of assessing risks, planning courses of action, and executing objectives.  
2.2   Joint Programming Guidance VII, dated 9 June 2006, directed the GFM DI to proceed in two phases - defined by the General Officer Steering Committee as Task One and Task Two.  The impetus for implementing a comprehensive GFM Data Strategy (GFM DS) is that currently the assignment, allocation, and apportionment processes are not integrated; the data necessary to support such integration is not visible, accessible, or usable; and there is no single, authoritative data source (ADS) for force structure data that meets the needs of all users, systems, or functions. The force structure data created by the GFM DI lays the foundation for integrating these three force management processes.
2.3   The objective of GFM DI is to integrate information from disparate applications and present it as though it came from a single source. The JOpsC family of future capabilities, especially the joint functional and integrating areas of Force Management, Command and Control, Net-Centric, and Focused Logistics, are reliant upon the success of GFM DI to resolve much of what the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System effort identifies as the friction and inefficiency of the Department's force management capability. GFM DI implementation is also a requirement for achieving Total Force Visibility. 
2.4   There were three principal and integrated actions required to transform the effectiveness of GFM DI that have been completed in Task One work in Fiscal Years 2007 - 2009.  First, the development of an Organizational Force Structure Construct (OFSC): a hierarchical framework of universal rules expressed in mathematical terms by which force structure data may be organized, electronically documented, and exploited by software programs. Second, the Global Force Management Information Exchange Data Model, (GFMIEDM), is based on a Joint standard that was developed to capture force structure data in a common persistent format. It captures the minimum essential data elements required for the electronic documentation of authorized force structure while permitting future linkages to a distributed network of databases where personnel, materiel, readiness, deployed location, and other data may be linked with the force structure authorizations and then integrated in a classified en! vironment. Finally, the tagging of force structure data across the DOD with standardized, unambiguous identifiers, (known as Force Management Identifiers (FMIDS), and marking each data asset with metadata tags in Extensible Markup Language (XML), promotes the efficacy of discovery services.

Moreinformation will be posted at a later date. -----Overall Scope of Requirements: The Rapid Response Space Works (RRSW) and Modular SpaceVehicle (MSV) procurement has two primary objectives. The first objective is to standupinitial operations of the RRSW. This objective creates the ability for the ORS Office tomeet its Deploy mission capability of rapidly deploying capabilities to the warfighterwithin days to weeks. The second objective is to procure, outside of the RRSW, modularmulti-mission space vehicles and/or buses and payloads for the RRSW. The first plannedprocurement under the MSV award is a task order for a modular Synthetic Aperture RadarSatellite (SARSat). In close cooperation and coordination with the RRSW and ORS Office,modular spacecraft will be designed, integrated, tested, launched, and will be controlledand operated to meet the RRSW responsive concept. The architecture developed for theseresponsive, modular spacecraft will be designed in such a way as to allow flexibility tomeet multiple missions with minimal changes within the basic design. The spacecraftarchitecture will include a multi-mission, modular bus design and multi-mission, modularpayload designs (mission kits will include electro-optical (EO) and radio frequency (RF)payloads). -----The work will be performed at Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico. -----NASA/ARC is planning a solicitation with multiple contracts to be awarded. One award fora single IDIQ contract for the stand-up and initial operations of the RRSW and a multipleaward IDIQ for modular space vehicles, buses, and payloads. We anticipate the RRSW awardwould be a 5 year IDIQ contract that consists of a 3 year base with two one-year options.Additionally, we anticipate awarding multiple five-year Modular Space Vehicle IDIQcontracts to the most qualified contractors capable of providing the modular spacevehicles, buses and modular payloads to meet the ORS mission set. Both of these effortsare planned to be International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) restricted and operateat least at a DoD Secret level. The individual task orders on the multiple IDIQ contractswill specify the mission requirement, whether the call is for a space vehicle, or just apayload or bus, and will establish the period of performance. -----Contractor Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Plans will be evaluated in theirability to mitigate interactions and potential conflicts between RRSW and MSV contracts. -----The NAICS Code is 541712  Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, andLife Sciences (except Biotechnology) with Size Standard: 1000 employees, under theexception of Space Vehicles and Guided Missiles, their Propulsion Units, their PropulsionUnits Parts, and their Auxiliary Equipment and Parts -----Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.

<DESC>THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS SOLICITATION IS BROUGHT FORWARD FROM PREVIOUS SOLICITATION NUMBER DTFH68-09-B-00036.

THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN REOPENED AND WILL BE ADVERTISED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.

PROJECT DETAILS: The project is located within the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge, which is adjacent to the City of Lawton, Oklahoma and the Fort Sill Army Base. 

This project consists of the placement of fills on both sides of an existing 2-mile asphalt paved road (Six Mile Scenic Road) to provide additional width, and the construction of paved shoulders along both sides of the road. A double 10-foot by 5-foot concrete box culvert will be extended in place to match the new widths, along with the construction of new headwalls and wingwalls. Other circular metal culverts along the route will need to be extended. In order to perform the widening, both edges of the existing pavment must be saw cut along most of the length. Also included in the project are the replacement of guardrails and guardrail end terminals, grouted riprap at the culvert extensions, and the replacement of permanent signs.

The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of electric distribution system for the Iowa Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located Sioux Gateway Airport, to the Mid American Energy .  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. Mid American Energy (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The electric system being privatized is described as follows: The 185th ARW of the Iowa Air National Guard (IANG) occupies 287 acres on the southeast side of the Sioux Gateway Airport, located approximately 10 miles south of downtown Sioux City, Iowa. The 185th ARW occupies 45 buildings totaling approximately 359,000 square feet with approximately 350 full-time personnel.  Unit training drills conducted twice each month result in a surge of up to 1000 personnel. The electrical system at the Sioux Gateway Airport (ANG) is already partially privatized (through the local utility provider, Mid America Energy).  The remaining portion of the system (the portion covered under this contract) includes both overhead and underground circuits (2,250 and 13,235 linear feet respectively). Approximately 2,380 linear feet of the underground circuits are buried in PVC conduit, 3,480 linear feet are buried in PVC conduit encased in concrete, and 7,375 linear feet are direct buried. The system to be privatized includes one 225 kVA transformer, ten 600 A-L switches and no manholes. The system is a branched system (both overhead and underground), is a three-phase system rated at 15 kVA, and accepts an incoming voltage of 12kVA phase to phase and 7.28kVA leg to ground. <BR> <BR>Competitive proposals were requested in 2001 and no offers were received. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR><BR>Interested sources shall contact SMSgt Vicky L.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) anticipates that Request for Proposals (RFP) No. NHLBI-HB-11-03 will be available on or about October 30, 2009.  The solicitation will be for the Domestic Hubs for the program entitled &lsquo;Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-III (REDS-III).'  It is anticipated that up to four awards will be made under full and open competition to domestic sites in January 2011 for a period of seven years.<br /><br />The goal of this highly structured, multicenter, donor-recipient epidemiology, laboratory, and clinical outcomes program is to advance public health by conducting critical research to improve transfusion practices and the safety and adequacy of the blood supply in the U.S. and in countries affected by the AIDS epidemic.  NHLBI plans to support one data coordinating center (DCC), one central laboratory, up to four domestic hubs, and up to four international collaborative programs involving U.S. investigators and investigators at international blood centers.  <strong>This notice addresses the domestic hubs only.</strong> The REDS-III program will target the following blood banking and transfusion medicine areas:  1) Donor targeted strategies; 2) blood banking; 3) transfusion practices in adult patients; and 4) education and training.  The program will include survey, epidemiological and laboratory investigations.  Clinical trials in potential recipients of blood products are NOT within the purview of the REDS-III program.  The research portfolios of the REDS-III Domestic and International programs will be fashioned in response to contemporary scientific questions that need to be addressed to advance blood transfusion safety in the U.S. and in countries where REDS-III international blood centers are located.  It is expected that about one third of the studies conducted in the REDS-III Domestic program will address donor and/or donation safety and availability issues, and other blood banking questions; the remaining two thirds of the investigations will address adult transfusion recipient safety concerns.  Comprehensive databases including information on donors and their donations/components, and on adult patients considered for, or receiving a transfusion will enable study investigators with the necessary scientific and analytical expertise to address in a timely fashion important scientific issues in blood banking and transfusion medicine.  <br /><br />The domestic hubs and the international programs will be supported by a DCC responsible for overall coordination, communications, data management, and analytical/statistical support.  The domestic hubs and the international programs will also be supported by a central laboratory which will be responsible for the necessary infectious disease, molecular, genetic, immunological, hematological and other testing conducted in the U.S., and for serving as the REDS-III biospecimen repository.  <br /><br />The domestic component of the REDS-III program shall be structured to include geographically dispersed hubs with each hub consisting of a blood center and one or more transfusion services which support a mixed hospital base of tertiary care and community hospitals.  This type of structure shall ensure access to demographically diverse adult patient populations, and access to services that perform most of the blood transfusions.  The studies to be conducted in the REDS-III hospitals shall focus on adult patients.  Hence, studies of pediatric in-hospital patient populations shall not be part of the REDS-III Domestic program.<br /><br />The offeror must meet the following two (2) mandatory qualification criteria at the time of receipt of proposal to be considered any further for award:<br />1) 	The offeror shall structure a hub consisting of a blood center and one or more transfusion services which support a mixed hospital base of tertiary care and community hospitals.  The hub shall be led by a Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator.  The Principal Investigator must work either at one of the hospital transfusion services or at the blood center.  If based at a transfusion service, the Co-Principal Investigator must work at the blood center.  Conversely, if the Principal Investigator is based at the blood center, the Co-Principal Investigator must be based at a transfusion service.  Each hub shall be required to include a mix of tertiary (at least one) and community (at least one) hospitals to ensure access to diverse adult patient populations and representation of all required services.  Each hub is required to have access to, and the demonstrated ability to interact successfully with, the following five hospital services:  intensive care unit(s), cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery, oncology/cancer center, and trauma services. <br />2)	To ensure the statistical relevance of the resulting data, the offeror shall provide evidence and supporting documentation for the last two years that at least 75,000 allogeneic donations per year were collected by the hub's blood center.<br /><br />Each domestic hub will perform the following program requirements:  1) Propose epidemiologic, survey, and/or laboratory studies that will advance blood transfusion safety in the U.S.; 2) Serve as a member of the REDS-III Oversight Committee; 3) Serve as a voting member of the REDS-III Domestic Steering Committee; 4) Develop and finalize REDS-III study protocols; 5) Ensure access to demographically diverse adult patient populations and services that perform most of the blood transfusions; 6) Include a blood center that collects a minimum of 75,000 allogeneic blood donations per year and serves as the major supplier of blood to the participating hospitals within the hub; 7) Participate in, coordinate, and successfully conduct the REDS-III research protocols that have been approved by the REDS-III Domestic Steering Committee; 8) Serve as a Centralized Data Collection Center (CCC); 9) Collect, process, store, and ship biospecimens as required by study protocols; 10) Administer the REDS-III hub scope of work, including study protocols, and transmit complete and accurate scientific data to the Data Coordinating Center, in accordance with procedures set forth in the protocols and Manuals of Operations, which shall be developed by the REDS-III investigators for this program; 11) Participate in educational activities, such as the promotion of public and health care provider education by disseminating research results and/or conducting research methodology training; 12) Mentor a minimum of one junior investigator in the areas of blood banking and/or transfusion medicine starting in Year 2 of the program, and prepare the investigator to apply for NHBLI career development awards; 13) Participate in all committee and subcommittee meetings, conference calls, and other organizational training sessions of which the Principal Investigator, Co-Principal Investigator, Co-Investigators, Project Director, and hub center staff are members.<br /><br />It will be desirable that a total of at least  20,000 RBC transfusion exposures occur per year at the hub's participating hospitals/outpatient clinics.  It would also be desirable, although not required, that the consortium of hospitals participating in the hub admitted the following minimum number of cross-matched adult patients each year at the following hospital services:<br />1) intensive care units, minimum of 1,000 cross-matched adult patients per year;<br />2) cardiac surgery, minimum of 1,000 cross-matched adult patients per year;<br />3) orthopedic surgery, minimum of 500 cross-matched adult patients admitted per year;<br />4) oncology/cancer center, minimum of 1,000 cross-matched adult patients per year; and<br />5) trauma service, minimum of 1,000 cross-matched adult patients per year, or alternatively, participation in a level 1 trauma program.<br /><br /><strong>This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP)</strong>.&nbsp; Although up to four awards are anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.  It is also the offerors' responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any amendments to the RFP.  The RFP will contain all the information and details to allow potential offerors to prepare and submit a contract proposal.  This acquisition has been designated as a full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712.  Subcontracting opportunities are anticipated during the course of this contract award. <strong> All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the NHLBI.</strong>

NHLBI plans to support one data coordinating center (DCC), one central laboratory, up to 4 domestic hubs, and up to 4 international collaborative programs involving U.S. investigators and investigators at international blood centers.  <strong>This notice addresses the international hubs only.</strong> The REDS-III program will target the following blood banking and transfusion medicine areas:  1) Donor targeted strategies; 2) blood banking; 3) transfusion practices in adult patients; and 4) education and training.  The REDS-III International program shall include epidemiologic and survey research as well as laboratory investigations.  Clinical trials in potential recipients of blood products are NOT within the purview of the REDS-III program.  A comprehensive longitudinal donation and donor database from each foreign collection site containing information on all donations collected during the period of the contract shall also be established to enable study investigators to address important blood safety issues.  The research portfolios of the REDS-III Domestic and International programs will be fashioned in response to contemporary scientific questions that need to be addressed to advance blood transfusion safety in the U.S. and in countries where REDS-III international blood centers are located.  The major objectives of the research in the REDS-III International program are:  1) assess and monitor the prevalence and incidence of HIV-1, HIV-2 and other existing as well as newly discovered infectious agents that pose a threat to blood safety; 2) assess risks of transfusion-transmitted infections; 3) assess the impact of existing and new blood donor screening methodologies on blood safety and availability; 4) evaluate characteristics and behaviors of blood donors including risk factors for acquiring HIV and other blood-borne agents; and 5) evaluate the donation process for ways to improve the safety and adequacy of the blood supply.  Some studies may also address transfusion recipient safety concerns such as evaluating non-infectious transfusion risks (e.g., alloimmunization) and ways to reduce their occurrence.<br /><br />The domestic hubs and the international programs will be supported by a DCC responsible for overall coordination, communications, data management, and analytical/statistical support.  The domestic hubs and the international programs will also be supported by a central laboratory which will be responsible for the necessary infectious disease, molecular, genetic, immunological, hematological and other testing conducted in the U.S., and for serving as the REDS-III biospecimen repository.  <br /><br />The infrastructure of the REDS-III international component shall consist of U.S. blood centers which have ongoing collaborative research arrangements with blood centers in low or middle income countries impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  The blood centers participating in each international program must collect a total of at least 250,000 blood donations annually from at least three collaborating foreign collection sites. The foreign collection sites should be geographically dispersed and, whenever possible, be representative of the varying prevalence of HIV in the region(s)/country of interest.  Each foreign blood collection site must collect a minimum of 25,000 donations annually. The infrastructure shall include a centralized data collection center (CCC) responsible for compiling donor/donation data and protocol specific data from participating blood centers within each country before being submitted to the REDS-III DCC.  <br /><br />The offeror must meet the following three (3) mandatory qualification criteria at the time of receipt of proposal to be considered any further for award:<br />1.	The offeror shall be a U.S. blood center, blood bank, or academic institution (henceforth referred to as a U.S. blood center) with an established collaborative program with a foreign blood center or blood bank in a low or middle income country where HIV/AIDS is prevalent.<br />2.	The offeror shall provide evidence of scientific collaborations with proposed foreign site investigator(s) that could include participating in research project(s) in the foreign country, publications, and/or conducting training programs in the foreign country.<br />3.	To ensure the statistical relevance of the resulting data, the offeror shall provide evidence (e.g., official institutional letter certifying the information) that the proposed foreign blood collection sites located in a low or middle income country collect a total of at least 250,000 blood donations per year from at least three collaborating foreign collection sites within the same country, and that each of the sites collects a minimum of 25,000 annual blood donation.<br /><br />Each U.S. Blood Center will perform the following program requirements:  1)  Manage the REDS-III international sites scope of work and study protocols and ensure transmission of complete and accurate scientific data from the foreign blood collection sites (subcontracts) to the REDS-III DCC, in accordance with procedures set forth in the protocols and Manuals of Procedures; 2) Manage through foreign subcontracts the collection of a minimum of 250,000 blood donations annually from at least three collaborating and geographically dispersed foreign collection sites located in a low or middle income country affected by the AIDS epidemic. Each foreign blood collection site must collect a minimum of 25,000 donations annually; 3) Propose epidemiologic, survey, and/or laboratory studies that will advance blood transfusion safety in the country of interest; 4)  U.S. blood center Principal Investigator shall serve as a member of the REDS-III Oversight Committee; 5) U.S. blood center and foreign investigators shall serve as members of the REDS-III country-specific International Steering Committee; 6) U.S. blood center and foreign collection sites shall participate in, coordinate, and successfully conduct the REDS-III research protocols that have been approved by the REDS-III country-specific International Steering Committee; 7) Oversee the establishment and the management of a Centralized Data Collection Center (CCC); 8) Translate all materials to appropriate languages or dialects, or to English, as appropriate; 9) Oversee the collection, processing, testing, and storage of biospecimens by the foreign blood collection sites as required by study protocols; 10) In collaboration with the REDS-III central laboratory and the DCC, the U.S. blood center shall oversee the shipment of specific biospecimens of research interest to the U.S. for laboratory testing which for technical or financial reasons is better accomplished at the central laboratory (or at another US testing facility subcontracted by the central laboratory); 11) Administer approved surveys and ensure that the foreign blood collection sites incorporate study protocols into blood center operations, contact participants, distribute questionnaires, collect and process data, address donor inquiries, and provide data to the CCC; 12) Participate in all committee and subcommittee meetings, conference calls, and organizational training sessions of which the international site Investigators and staff are members; and 13) obtain all necessary governmental, administrative, and regulatory approvals to ensure participation in and successful completion of all studies included in the REDS-III country-specific research portfolio.<br /><br /><strong>This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP)</strong>.&nbsp; Although up to four awards are anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Northeast and Caribbean Region, Public Building Service, Project Management Division is pleased to announce an opportunity for A/E services for the design and construction of a new Federal building in san Juan Puerto Rico. The building will be located at 150 Carlos E. Chardon Street, Hato Rey. P.R. This procurement is for the selection of a highly qualified Architectural/Engineering (A/E) firm interested in participating in a potential opportunity under GSA’s Design Excellence Program, to design and provide construction management and inspection services for a new federal building with approximately 240,000 GSF.

 This new Federal building will be a high-performance green building to be located on an existing 27 acre federal campus. This new project will make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the existing structures of site and provides the Government with a facility that will meet high security requirements and tenant space needs. The new facility will be energy efficient and will have a LEED Silver rating goal from the U.S. Green Building Council. 

Funding for the design of this project was requested as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. A portion of this funding was used by the General Services Administration to procure the services of an A/E 	firm to create a master plan for the site. This master plan, currently in design, will be provided to the designer and will be the basis for the design of the new federal facility. 

The Estimated Construction Cost Range for this project is between $118,000,000 and $120,000,000. Funds allocated via www.recovery.gov reflect funds for design of the entire project and construction of a parking garage. Funding for construction of the FBI facility will be requested in the Fiscal year 2012 (Capital Program Request). The Request for Qualifications (RFQ) (Phase 1 Solicitation) is scheduled to be issued on or about November 6, 2009, via FedBizOps (http://www.fbo.gov/). A pre-proposal conference date will be posted with the phase 1 solicitation information. GSA intends to contract for complete design and construction  administration (M&I) services that offers the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to design and construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters of this project. 

The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials, equipment and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract. Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest price offeror. Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price. 

The procurement process will be performed in two (2) phases. Phase I will consist of the portfolio review. The portfolio in phase I, provides an overview of the lead designers and design firm’s philosophy and design approach.  The technical factors for phase II are tentatively as follows: (#1)Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services (#2)Past Experience on similar projects (#3)Past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules and (#4)Experience with projects in the Caribbean or similar market.

The technical factors for phase II Request for Proposals (RFP) are tentatively as follows: Detailed organizational structure and qualifications of key personnel; Project management plan and Staffing plan. Price proposals and a subcontracting plan (if the offeror is not a small business concern) will also be required during phase II.

Following the evaluation of the phase I proposals, a short list of the most qualified offerors will be selected to further compete in phase II. Any and all cost saving concepts and scoping measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of phase I, or II shall become the property of the government and may be incorporated into the drawings and specifications for use under this project at no recompense to the offeror(s).
 Phase II submission: Only firms selected to be on the short-list will enter into this phase of the solicitation. 

This procurement is open to small and large business concerns. Before award of the contract, the business concern (if not a small business concern), shall be required to present an acceptable, proactive subcontracting plan, pursuant to FAR Part 19.7. GSA’s Socio-Economic Program goals are below, but contractors should develop their own goals with these in mind: Small Business (36%), Small Disadvantaged Business (6%), Small Woman-Owned Business (5%), HUBZone Business (3%), Veteran-Owned (5%), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business (3%). Failure to submit and/or comply with the minimum requirements of the subcontracting plan will render the offeror unacceptable. All questions and clarifications regarding the project documents shall be put in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer. Production costs and proposal preparation costs are at the expense of the offeror. 

All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the Solicitation Number. The design of this project is being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) for 2009. Reporting documents from the Contractor are mandated per the act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">The General Services announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. Project Summary: GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price contract for all construction services necessary to fully renovate and modernize the Lafayette Building located between Vermont Avenue, 15<sup>th</sup>, and Eye Street N.W., Washington, DC. The award will comprise a base construction contract with American Recovery &amp; Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds, and multiple options with congressional appropriated funds. The estimated construction cost range for the base construction contract is $85,000,000 to $105,000,000. The estimated construction cost range for the multiple options is $65,000,000 to $85,000,000. The Lafayette Building is comprised of 12 stories and approximately 565,000 GSF, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The current building tenants include the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and commercial retail entities. The project is being designed to meet LEED Silver certification and GSA Class A status, and maintain its listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Project Scope: The project scope includes a total refurbishment of the exterior fa&ccedil;ade and windows, replacement of interior finishes, preservation of historic features and upgrade of all building systems, including physical building security. All hazardous materials accessible at the time of construction will be removed. The project will also include building amenity spaces such as a health care unit, wellness center, and concession area. Renovation is planned for implementation in two phases with the building approximately 50% occupied throughout the project. All work will be performed in accordance with GSA authorized and approved standards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Procurement Strategy: Pursuant to FAR Subpart 15.3, GSA will employ source selection tradeoff procedures to procure and award the construction contract for this project. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, will be approximately equal to price. The selection process will have two stages. Stage I, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), shall result in the establishment of a list of offerors identified as Viable Competitors, who will be invited to participate in the next stage of the procurement, Stage II. Stage II, Request for Proposals (RFP), shall result in the selection of the construction contractor whose offer provides the Government with the best value. In Stage I, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that are critical to this procurement and that will serve as the basis for the determination of the viable competitors. Interested offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each offeror in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the RFP or, based on the information submitted in the RFQ response, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. Notwithstanding this advice, an offeror that is unlikely to be a viable competitor may participate in Stage II of the procurement. Offerors that did not submit a timely RFQ response in Stage I will not be allowed to participate in the remaining stage of the procurement. In Stage II, the Government will issue the RFP, which will include the 100% construction drawings, to the viable competitors and the other offerors from Stage I that elect to participate in Stage II. The RFP will serve as the basis for the firm-fixed price offers from the offerors in Stage II. The firm-fixed price offers will be due by the date established in the RFP. Based on the Stage I and Stage II submissions, the Government shall select the offer that reflects the best value to the Government. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Stage I and Stage II offers without discussions. The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about November 16, 2009, on the Internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Opportunities for Other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors. Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and FAR Subpart 19.702, an offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a subcontracting plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote subcontractors' use of registered apprenticeship programs.</p>

Type of Contract <br /></strong><br />The Government anticipates award of up to four (4) IDIQ prime contracts to the highest qualified firms to perform required services. Prime contracts will contain Firm-Fixed-Price, Time-and-Material, Labor-Hour, and Cost-Reimbursable Contract Line Items (CLINs). TO contract type is negotiable; however, it is anticipated most TOs will have firm-fixed-priced labor with cost-reimbursable line items, as required. Travel expenses will be pre-approved by the Government and cost-reimbursable. <br /><br /><strong>d. Cost Range, Limitations, and General Information<br /></strong><br />(1) Maximum contract guarantee for each IDIQ contract is $50K. <br /><br />(2) Cumulative ceiling price for all IDIQ contracts shall not exceed $25M. Ceiling price includes all TOs awarded against all IDIQ contracts.</p>
<p>(3) Anticipated minimum TO awards is $25K.</p>
<p>(4) Anticipated maximum TO awards are as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Environmental Planning - $1.5M</p>
<p>(b) Programming - $1.5M</p>
<p>(c) A-E Services - $1M <br /><br />(5) Maximum Fully Burdened Labor Rates (FBLRs) for each labor category shall be negotiated and fixed for the 5-year contract period. Travel shall be pre-approved by the Government and a cost-reimbursable expense. Other general cost information:<br /><br />(a) The highest ranked firms will receive a Request for Proposal (RFP). The RFP will require firms to complete a cost proposal workbook prepared by the Government in Microsoft EXCEL. The cost workbook identifies required labor categories and requires input of "base rates" for each labor category and "indirect rates" used to calculate maximum FBLRs. <br /><br />(b) The Government will evaluate each maximum "base rate" and "indirect rates" applied to the "base rates" to calculate the "maximum" FBLR for each labor category for years 1 thru 5. "Base rates" and "indirect rates" will be determined fair and reasonable, or negotiated to a fair and reasonable price, prior to contract award. <br /><br />(c) Profit is negotiable; however, profit proposed in excess of 5% is consider reasonable for "high risk" requirements, and services required for this acquisition are not considered "high risk."</p>
<p>(d) Requirement for payment of "maximum" FBLRs - The Government will pay "maximum" FBLRs only when contractor employees are paid the "maximum" base rate used to calculate the "maximum" FBLR. Reduced base rates paid to employees mandate reduced FBLRs proposed/billed to the Government. This requirement is mandated because "base rates" vary among employees performing the same services; therefore, FBLRs will vary commensurate with "base rates" paid to employees. Maximum FBLRs protect the contractor, and reduced FBLRs when applicable protect the Government from <em>overpayment</em> of profit. Example of FBLR maximum &amp; reduced calculations:</p>

<p>(e) A nominal annual escalation rate may be applied and negotiated prior to award. The nominal escalation rate shall be based on historical averages.</p>
<p>(f) Firms proposing/billing escalated FBLR each year shall pay employees the "escalated base rate" for the Government to pay the escalated rate.</p>
<p>(g) Labor "vacancy credit" requirement - Labor "vacancy credits" shall be provided to the Government when a Firm-Fixed-Priced "full-time" contractor employee position is required and the position becomes vacant during the performance period. The vacancy credit begins the first workday the position is vacant and ends when the position is filled with a equally or higher qualified employee.

<DESC>Synopsis: <br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotes. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. <br /><br />Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Interested vendors responding to this RFI may provide capability information for one or multiple pieces of this requirement or for an entire solution.<br /><br />Background:<br />The U. S. Office of Personnel Management is seeking a fresh, innovative solution to deliver on-line employment information services for the Federal Government. The Federal Employment Information System, commonly referred to as USAJOBS, is intended to provide Federal job seekers with searchable access to Federal job vacancy listings and job announcements; automated notice of job matching; on-line r&eacute;sum&eacute; development, storage, and submission; and links to information about the Federal employment process. In addition to the job seeker capabilities, USAJOBS provides specific employer focused benefits such as applicant database mining and templates for simplified job announcement posting. USAJOBS is the core of the Recruitment One-Stop (ROS) project, an important E-Government (E-Gov) initiative. ROS is one part of the Government-wide effort that commits the Federal Government, in general, and OPM specifically, to a timely and efficient hiring process.<br /><br />Statement of the Problem:<br />OPM wants to ensure that USAJOBS continues to maintain its status as a preeminent, state-of-the-art employment information system, serving as an effective vehicle to attract the best and brightest individuals to public service. For the basic solution, the USAJOBS system must maintain the current functionality provided by USAJOBS. However, in addition to the basic solution, OPM is interested in finding the latest trends and technologies for improving the Government's ability to attract, recruit, and retain an effective, highly-qualified workforce. In this effort, we are looking for solutions that may include access to the social networking media platforms commonly used in today's internet environment. In addition, we are seeking ways to proactively reach passive candidates, attracting them to the USAJOBS listings, accessing potential candidates through professional profiles available through external sources, and guiding applicants through a career discovery process by which they are able to determine which opportunities best meet their expertise, competencies, and interests. We also require integration of USAJOBS with the various third-party back-end systems selected by Federal agencies to manage applications and associated assessments. We welcome other ideas for functionality not mentioned that enable USAJOBS to better serve the needs of job seekers and agencies. Because of the complexity of the solution, we have decided to solicit information from all available sources in the marketplace to contribute ideas on how best to achieve these objectives.<br /><br />The USAJOBS system must allow searchable access to Federal job vacancy announcements as well as specialized categories of vacancies, such as student opportunities or executive vacancies. Access must also be provided to separate agency recruiting sites, which may not have opportunities posted on USAJOBS. Jobseeker access must also be as broad as possible, including but not limited to non-internet means such as telephone and interactive voice recognition to provide access to individuals with disabilities and jobseekers without internet access through the use of emerging technologies.<br /><br />The system must provide Federal job seekers the opportunity to:<br />&bull; Receive guidance about the job search, careers, or other pertinent information through searchable FAQ's, tutorials, or some other means;<br />&bull; Utilize career discovery tools;<br />&bull; Create their r&eacute;sum&eacute; in a common format, and send it to as many job openings as they wish;<br />&bull; Upload or scan r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, and other documents into the provided applicant databases; &bull; Apply to jobs through non-internet means;<br />&bull; Download forms for use in application procedures;<br />&bull; Access application materials manually delivered to USAJOBS;<br />&bull; Identify available jobs that match both their skills and interests;<br />&bull; Obtain early feedback regarding basic eligibility requirements for positions in which they applied;<br />&bull; Track the status of their on-line applications;<br />&bull; Automatically receive job vacancy announcements within search parameters; and<br />&bull; Receive customer service assistance, either by phone, email or live chat.<br /><br />In addition USAJOBS must permit, Federal agencies to:<br />&bull; Post all job opportunity announcements, receive applications, and return application status to job seekers;<br />&bull; Push job announcements to third-party sites, including social networking sites;<br />&bull; Integrate agency-specific assessment, staffing, and tracking systems with USAJOBS through secure interconnections;<br />&bull; Mine on-line r&eacute;sum&eacute; database for recruitment and hiring;<br />&bull; Match searchable r&eacute;sum&eacute;s with jobs;<br />&bull; Translate Knowledge Skills and Abilities (KSAs) to federal specific criteria; and<br />&bull; Receive customer service, either by phone, email or live chat.<br /><br />The USAJOBS Program Office must have the ability to:<br />&bull; Access administrative tools for system monitoring, auditing, and maintenance<br />&bull; Integrate USAJOBS with agency selected assessment systems;<br />&bull; Transfer applicant employment information;<br />&bull; Conduct website applicant usability testing to report results and findings for updates and new releases;<br />&bull; Create customized performance metrics and obtain customized reporting;<br />&bull; Review site statistics and trends;<br />&bull; Review customer satisfaction reports;<br />&bull; Edit individual accounts and the site through enhanced administrative capabilities; and<br />&bull; Receive customer service assistance, either by phone, email or live chat.<br />The system must also provide:<br />&bull; A test environment which mirrors the production environment and is accessible to other vendor systems as determined by the Program Office;<br />&bull; A mirror site for continuing operation during transfer or system downtime;<br />&bull; Documented Connectivity Agreements; and<br />&bull; Project management and consulting services for timely and cost-effective service delivery and ongoing system and service enhancement, including on-site personnel and other support as determined by the Program Office.<br /><br />The system and any of its components must comply with the following technical standards:<br />&bull; Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998;<br />&bull; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); and<br />&bull; Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA).<br /><br />OPM does not want a solution that limits itself to the requirements stated above. Enhanced functionality not mentioned above may also be presented with the expectation that it will be integrated into the system. The system must be able to adapt to new recruitment initiatives and technologies. Furthermore, because of the fluid nature of online recruitment, the proposed system must also be able to expand and incorporate other undetermined functionality requirements throughout implementation.<br /><br />Because of the on-going requirements of the USAJOBS system to provide potential applicants with Federal employment information and related services in such a manner that will attract the best and brightest individuals to public service, OPM must leverage current system functionality, accessibility and position itself to meet any new requirements needed to support the reformation of the Federal hiring process.

Description: 

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency safeguards America and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosives) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate, and counter the threat and mitigate its effects.  This mission is carried out through various non-proliferation, counter-proliferation, and consequence management activities.  DTRA provides this counter WMD support to the Combatant Commands (COCOMS) worldwide, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, the military services, and other Federal Agencies.  To assist DTRA in fulfilling this mission, DTRA is seeking interested sources capable of providing Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) support to the Operations Enterprise (OPS), Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction Enterprise (CW), and DTRA Headquarters Liaison Support Office (LNO).  A top level synopsis of these Enterprises/Office is provided below:

The Operations Enterprise’s mission highlights a range of activities that support DTRA’s overall mission and includes: force protection/mission assessments; emergency management; operational planning and support; nuclear programs and stockpile operations; and training and inspections to Combatant Commands (COCOMS) worldwide, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, the military services and the Interagency.  

The Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction Enterprise’s mission responsibilities cross a variety of missions to include all technical, managerial and staff functions required to plan, integrate, and execute programs to support US Strategic Command, OSD, the Joint Staff, COCOMS, Services, Intelligence Community, and first responders through the primary tasks of leadership, plans support, threat intelligence support, operations support, and technical reachback support.  

DTRA Headquarters Liaison Support serves as Director’s focal point for planning, coordinating, and facilitating Agency support to the Joint Staff, the Services, the National Guard Bureau, and the COCOMs and coordinates, integrates and monitors DTRA support. 

Potential sources either alone or with appropriate teaming partners must have demonstrated expertise and capability to perform A&AS support.  Qualified sources shall assist DTRA by providing information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, operational and technical support, training, and day-to-day administrative support to assist DTRA in the following areas:

<SOLNBR>8860
<RESPDATE>111309
<ARCHDATE>11282009
<CONTACT>Tim Costas, 202-385-8570

<a href="mailto:tim.costas@faa.gov">tim.costas@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>Purpose:  The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to gain industry insight into technical and acquisition solutions to the modernization of terminal air traffic control systems.  Throughout the acquisition process it is the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) goal to maximize effective competition and the Program Office intends to engage industry as well as other stakeholders to assist in meeting that goal.
Background:  The FAA intends to modernize or replace older terminal automation systems that are at End of Life (EOL) or End of Service (EOS) at approximately 158 Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities (TRACONs) and their associated towers. The program addresses technology to replace and modernize systems in such a manner that safety, capacity and aging/obsolescence concerns with existing systems are resolved.  It will include a potential new, scalable system that will meet requirements for Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and other major enhancements. A Mission Needs Statement (MNS) for ARTS IIIE/ARTS IIE Upgrades to Selected Air Traffic (AT) Facilities, Mission Need Statement, MNS-003, dated January 1992, and Mission Need Statement "Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS)," MNS-230, dated June 1996 apply to this acquisition.  
This acquisition addresses several FAA Flight Plan (FP) strategic initiatives, notably increased safety and greater capacity.  It is also specifically focused on areas of convergence regarding Mid-Term NextGen requirements.  This acquisition will address new controller displays, common and scalable hardware, and common software. It may incorporate NextGen concepts as operationally defined.  For example: Terminal Flight Data Management (TFDM), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), Data Communications, System Wide Information Management (SWIM), and Electronic Flight Strips (EFS).  
Questions:1.	To what extent would effective competition be impacted by requiring vendors to have an existing system certified within the NAS to be eligible to compete? 2.	To what extent would effective competition be impacted by requiring vendors to have an existing system certified by civil aviation authority with a minimum of 10,000,000 enplanements per year to be eligible to compete? 3.	To what extent would effective competition be impacted by providing government furnished information (STARS, C-ARTS, High Desert TRACON), and what are, if any, export control issues? 4.	To what extent would effective competition be impacted by competing separately for hardware and software solutions? 5.	To what extent are there available solutions that provide equivalent air traffic control capabilities to current Terminal operations?  Reference FAA Order 7110.65 6.	To what extent do the solutions provided in response to question five (5) provide an open system architecture? Please briefly describe and define how your proposed solution meets an open system architecture. 7.	Please identify, and prioritize with explanation, what criteria or key discriminators should the FAA consider in making any vendor down-select or award decisions.  8.	How would you propose ensuring acceptance and adoption of human computer interface attributes by our professional workforce? 9.	What should the FAA look for in a proposed solution that enables future NextGen operational improvements?10.	What are the benefits and challenges to the FAA of using existing solutions (e.g. En Route Automation Modernization) to satisfy Terminal operational requirements?  11.	Based on the above questions, please provide details as to what acquisition approach, i.e. contract type or pricing approaches, would be most beneficial to the FAA.12.	The goal of the above questions is to gain industry insight into technical and acquisition solutions to the modernization of terminal air traffic control systems so that the FAA can maximize effective competition.
Please provide any additional comments or solutions not addressed above.  
Responses will be accepted until November 13, 2009.  
All responses must be submitted via email to Mr. Tim Costas at Tim.Costas@FAA.Gov.  Response must be limited to one (1) page limit per question response (8" X 11") in Times New Roman Font size 10.  
This RFI is for information-gathering purposes only, as provided in the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS). This is not a solicitation or Screening Information Request (SIR). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. No solicitation document exists at this time. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to issue a solicitation. In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.

<DESC>The responses to this second Request For Information (RFI) will be used for informational purposes only.  Information designated as "Public Doman" represents data that will be shared with industry via posting to the FAA Contracting Opportunities database.  Information designated as "Company Proprietary" is information that will be shared internally by the FAA only.  (Note: The FAA will not release or make public information deemed "Company Proprietary".)
This RFI is not intended to guarantee procurement of a product and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request For Proposal (RFP).  
Submission of the information requested in this RFI is voluntary.  Failure to provide the requested information will not prevent a vendor from submitting a formal response to a future SIR the FAA may release.  
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the responses to this market survey or activities contained herein.   Therefore, any costs associated with this submission are solely at the interested vendor's expense.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) NEXCOM program is requesting industry feedback with regard to commercially available Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio equipment and how it may fit into the overall FAA mission.  This equipment would be used to provide voice communications between ground facilities and aircraft in the Terminal and Flight Services environments.   
Description of RFI #2 Components:
1.	Background
One of the key components of the NEXCOM Segment II radio system is the Maintenance Data Terminal (MDT).  The purpose of this function is to provide configuration, control and status monitoring of each radio (VHF/UHF Transmitters and Receivers).
Among other features, the MDT allows FAA's maintenance personnel to:	Inspect and modify radio settings (e.g., Tx/Rx frequency selection, Tx Power, Rx Squelch level, Rx Audio output level)	Perform real-time control of radio functions (e.g., Tx keying, Rx Mute)	Perform real-time monitoring of radio parameters (e.g., Rx Received Signal Level, Rx S/S+N, Tx VSWR)	Perform real-time monitoring of alarm conditions	Perform software upgrades
In the past, the MDT was implemented as a separate software application executing in a portable PC that the technician connected to a single radio at a time using a serial port (RS-232).  The application included custom hardware-based security mechanisms to prevent access to the radio unless the proper authorization was provided.

2.	Other Considerations
	The new NEXCOM Segment II radios will incorporate a TCP/IP interface to implement the Voice Over IP capability (VoiP).  	Without any hardware additions or modifications, this interface can be also used to implement the MDT capability.	The higher throughput of this interface, typically a 10/100 Mbps Ethernet port, will facilitate the addition of new capabilities (i.e., real-time voice monitoring).	The intrinsic addressability of the TCP/IP interface will allow the local networking of the entire complement of radios at a given site (Local or Remote), so a technician could connect to this local network and have access to all the radios without having to physically connect to each single unit.
This new "TCP/IP MDT" could be implemented following two different approaches:
	As a Custom Application executing in a PC with networking capabilities communicating using the standard TCP/IP protocol to carry radio information in a vendor-defined proprietary format.	As an Embedded Web Server resident in each radio accessed from the networked PC using a Standard Web Browser (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Mozilla Firefox).

3.	Request for Information
The FAA believes that the second approach, using and Embedded Web Server in each radio, offers a number of advantages:
	Operating System Independence.  Support for multiple current and future operating systems (e.g., Windows XP/Vista/7, MAC, Linux), by not requiring a custom application under a single operating system to execute in the technician's terminal.  A simple Web Browser will be sufficient.	Cost-effectiveness.  Development of the MDT web server code using widely available web development tools and a large pool of web programmers.	High Security Standards.  Adoption of widely used high security standards such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246], a software-only solution commonly used for on-line banking applications.
The FAA desires to know:
3.1	If the implementation of an Embedded Web Server with the capabilities previously described is feasible and cost effective.3.2	What are the perceived advantages and disadvantages of this approach.  Include any applicable security considerations.  3.3	What are other capabilities that could be cost-effectively added to the basic MDT function.3.4	What is the impact on the radios offered to other clients if this approach is incorporated as a requirement for the NEXCOM Segment II radios.

The following timeline applies for inquiries related to contents of this RFI:  
1.	Vendor clarification inquiries must be submitted received no later than 2 pm, EDT on November 9, 2009.2.	FAA responses to vendor inquiries will be provided by November 20, 2009.  FAA responses will be provided by Dixie Harper and/or Scott Bukovec to the submitting vendor.  3.	Vendor responses will be provided no later than December 11, 2009.4.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT ACTION- This is a sources sought synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposals. The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center (NIH CC) Pharmacy Department is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey.
<p>The NIH CC Pharmacy Department is seeking a dispensing system for outpatient/take-home medications for a pharmacy within a research hospital that fills approximately 400 prescriptions per day. The dispensing system needs to consist of an information system including workflow management features, a dispensing robot, and devices to support dispensing medications not filled by the robot. The system must be able to be interfaced to Eclipsys' Sunrise Acute Care 5.0 (SAC) to allow medication orders entered in SAC to transfer to the outpatient system. The system must be able to handle entry of medications (e.g. investigational medications) not contained in the usual drug databases. The system needs to produce container labels, auxiliary labels, and patient information sheets. The dispensing robot should label the vials. The system should allow medication refill requests to occur via interactive voice response or web-based technology. The system should also be also to record dispensing medications when picked up by the patient.</p>
<p>The contractor(s) providing the services must have the requisite experience in installing pharmacy information systems and outpatient dispensing robots. They should have installed pharmacy information systems in at least five and dispensing robots in at least ten facilities. The contractor(s) must have experience developing interfaces from prescriber order entry systems to their information system. The contractor must also be able to provide system support on a 24/7 basis. <br /><br />The vendor responses must demonstrate their expertise in ALL of the following items. Please note that failure to specifically demonstrate capability to provide the required services in your response to this market survey may affect the Government's review of industry's ability to perform these services.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is requesting information from industry in order to identify qualified contractors interested in teaming with the Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst NJ (NAWCADLKE) in the production of an entire ship set of steam catapult Nose Gear Launch Assemblies (P/N 613474-6).  The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assess industry’s ability to deliver a ship-set of Nose Gear Launch Assemblies as a Schedule “A” deliverable with specific required shipyard dates for one of three approved Aircraft Carriers.  The Information provided in response to this RFI will be used by the government in the development of its acquisition strategy. Material identified as Company Proprietary provided in response to this RFI will be treated as Company Proprietary by the government.   The drawings involved are Export Controlled.  All requests for copies of these drawings must contain a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.  To obtain certification, contact Defense Logistics Information Service at (800)352-3572 or www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/documents.him.  The certified DD2345 shall be sent to Barbara Petrzilka at fax 732-323-7440 or email to barbara.petrzilka@navy.mil to obtain all the applicable specifications. Upon receipt and verification of the DD2345, a CD will be sent out to those vendors who have requested it with information regarding the NGL Assembliy.  Also, all vendors must be registered in the Central Contract Registration (CCR) Database.  The internet website is http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil/ccringq or www.ccr.gov.  

The Nose Gear Launch Assembly (P/N 613474-6) consists of the slide assembly, reset assembly, forward and aft slide-access tracks, buffer cylinder assembly, tensioner cylinder assembly, housing and shock absorber. These items provide a means to restrain and tension the aircraft prior to catapult launch.  The Nose Gear Launch Assembly is a complex integration of components containing critical tight tolerances (+ 0.001).  The system contains two critical safety item components which require 100% government inspection.  

Companies interested in delivering the NGL assembly are asked to respond to this RFI with a brief summary of their knowledge, capabilities and experience in the areas of ship aircraft launch systems (catapult) manufacturing. Respondents to this RFI should provide programmatic, technical and experience information on their ability to manufacture and deliver a Nose Gear Launch Assembly for US Navy carriers.  The overriding factor is the delivery of the components to meet specific required shipyard dates.  One of the components, Buffer Accumulator (P/N 615835-1), must be delivered within 12 months of contract award.  A second component, Valve Manifold Assembly (P/N 615845-16), must be delivered within 18 months of contract award and the remaining components are required within 24 months of contract award.  

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication that the PMA-251 Program Office or NAVAIR will contract for the items contained in the RFI. NAVAIR will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI.
Submit your response in a Microsoft® Word or compatible format document in no more than twenty single-sided, single-spaced pages, 12-point, Times New Roman font, using a minimum of one-inch margins. Responses to this RFI are requested by 1600 on 26 October 2009.

USTRANSCOM/TCAQ-R is seeking small business sources that may be able to provide complete transportation services of repairable DoD items within and between CONUS, Hawaii, Canada and all origin and destination points as indicated below.  

The program consists of transportation of repairable parts from two parent sites called Hubs, located on the West (San Diego, CA) and East (Norfolk, VA) Coasts, and smaller sites called Nodes, as well as other eRMS DoD and contractor facilities.  The Norfolk site is considered a Hub for material receipt, consolidation and shipping purposes.  San Diego is a Hub for the same receiving, consolidation and shipping purposes but is also designated as the sole Transportation Oversight/Management Hub.  Repairables from nodes/eRMS (Electronic Retrograde Management Program) activities located outside of the continental United States (OCONUS), as well as mobile expeditionary node material is occasionally shipped to a DoD point of entry using Government assets.  These shipments when picked up by the service provider and brought to a consolidation point will be incorporated into the overall consolidation effort in conjunction with other multiple pick up site freight.  Further consolidated shipment of these assets will constitute a shipment from a single point of origin to a destination within a designated region.

The Government requires the transportation services of one Contractor to move parts within and between CONUS, Hawaii and Canada.  The Contractor must have the capability to meet U.S. and Canadian Customs requirements for shipments to and from Canada.

Also included is an express service requirement for shipments (NRFI) that must be expedited from a hub or node to points throughout CONUS and Canada.  These urgently required shipments are known as Carcass Express items.  Other transportation phases of the program include express service for Repair and Return (R&R) shipments.  The Contractor shall maintain complete in-transit visibility over material and provide verifiable Proof of Receipt (POR), Proof of Transaction (POT), Proof of Shipment (POS) and Proof of Delivery (POD) at each point where material custody changes through timely, daily reporting using specified Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transaction.  Other services required include: Packaging and Palletizing, Creating Passive Radio Frequency Identification (pRFID) tags/labels and attaching them to pallet loads, Coordinating shipments up to 150 lbs with DoD Domestic Express carriers. Using Government owned IT systems such as Electronic Retrograde Management System (eRMS) to receive pickup directives (PUDs),

This effort will include the design, development, and implementation of a Natural Language Processing (NLP)/ Concept Based Indexing (CBI) interface with VistA Cache to obtain VA records and feedback information.  These records will be parsed using a proven natural language processing concept based indexing (NLP/CBI) system to extract and codify text information using vetted medical terminology such as Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine SNOMED.  The proposed solution is to build an interface to the VistA Cache and the NLP/CBI application that enables ontology driven rules using the NLP derived clinical data to message clinicians. The proof-of-concept is an informatics NLP/CBI application prototype that shall interface with the VA VistA system to query and input target clinical narrative source documents into the NLP/CBI parser.  The NLP/CBI application (front-end tool) shall parse and index the clinical text entries and create output in nearly real-time.  The output shall comprise a marked-up document whose view shows identified concepts, a data table(s) of codified ontology concepts, keywords, and respective document identification, word/phase/sentence/section location, and meta data.  The prototype knowledge engineering shall demonstrate post-coordination use of compositional expressions in a use case with a processed message to the clinician provider.  The contractor will integrate a knowledge extraction module (back-end tool) that allows users to design their own clinical algorithms with existing capacity to run them on the NLP/CBI output.  The prototype shall be developed and tested in the OI innovation sandbox development environment.  The contractor shall provide hardware and software support during one year prototype phase.  It is anticipated the VA will award a twelve-month Firm-Fixed-Price contract for this effort.  A DRAFT copy of the Statement of Work for this effort is attached.  The Statement of Work is subject to change before the issue of the final solicitation.  The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, and size standard is $25M.  Respondees should identify if they are a small business or small disadvantaged business concern, based on this NAICS code.Please submit expressions of interest in your own format to include documentation of corporate capabilities in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.  Please ensure responses do not exceed twenty (20) pages.  Since this is a Sources Sought Announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.

<DESC>To upgrade the Amethyst disk array from 20 TB usable storage to 100 TB usable storage, as well as increase its capability to handle increased user load with 6 Amethyst replacement nodes with  Graphstream P2X12B-R1B is a 1RU-rackmount server unit that can support GPU-computing applications more efficiently than currently available alternatives.

The Data Analysis and Assessment Center (DAAC) relies upon two main storage arrays. The first storage array is connected to Amethyst, which uses a Linux-based operating system.  This 20TB disk array was installed in January 2007 and consistently runs over 80% full. The Amethyst disk array is used by DAAC staff and HPCMP users. Amethyst is no longer able to efficiently process data sets, even with data staging, since current data sets are approaching 50 TB in size. 

The Amethyst disk array suffers not only from a capacity problem; it also suffers from a capability problem. Soon after installation, it was discovered that when more than six instances, either serial or parallel programs, access the file system, processing on Amethyst slows down considerably. This can easily be accomplished by having one person perform a parallel compilation, “make –j6”, of code. If two people are performing parallel compiles, the system grinds to a halt. Therefore the DAAC needs a system that can handle multiple users with multiple concurrent I/O streams

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 (Alaska) intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5, Section 5.203 and is supplemented with additional information contained within to Transboundary Ecologic LLC to subcontract with Mr. Artyukhin of Russia to preform a reanalyses of data collected for the Kittlitz's Murrelet in the Russian part of the Berin gSea.
Negotiations are estimated to occur approximately 15 days following the posting of this notice, with the estimated contract award approximately November 1, 2009.  The Government is contemplating award of a firm fixed price contract.
This announcement is for information purposes only.  No solicitation is available.  This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to compete this requirement.  A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice and currently available information about the intended recipient, is solely within the discretion of the Government.
BACKGROUND: The Russian part of the Bering Sea is known to support a significant portion of the world population of Kittlitz's Murrelets, a candidate species under the Endangered Species Act.  Yet, little information on the species status in this area is available.  Vyatkin (1999) presents a rough estimate of Kittlitz's Murrelet abundance, but the estimate was not subject to peer review and is not well documented.  Additionally, new surveys were carried out by Yuri Artyukhin in two successive years (2004 and 2005), with spatial overlap to Vyatkin's surveys.  
WORK DESCRIPTION: Contractor must demonstrate the ability to subcontract with Russian scientists Yuri Artyukhin for the purposes of reanalyzing their data sets on Kittlitz's Murrelet in the Russian part of the Bering Sea.  The re-analyses of the data must be conducted in a manner that is comparable to similar efforts in the United States (e.g., Kuletz et al. 2008).  The contractor must be able to work with the Russian Scientist to assure they prepare a manuscript, in English, for peer-reviewed publication.  Contractor will reanalyze the original Vyatkin data and analyze the Artyukhin data in a standardized fashion to ensure comparability.  Output data will include maps of surveyed birds, tables showing Kittlitz's Murrelet abundance and distribution, and documentation of estimated populations.  The contractor must be able to accomplish this work without the need for charging overhead for the subcontract.  All data must be made available to the FWS upon their request throughout the duration of the contract.
PRODUCTS: The contractor will provide the following services and products:1. Database and associated metadata of the Vyatkin and Artyukhin survey data - February 15, 2010;2.  Manuscript in English, in a format acceptable for submission to a journal such as Marine Ornithology, Bird Conservation, or the Auk. - February 15, 2010;3.  Presentation of findings at 2010 Pacific Seabird Group Symposium on Population Status and Trends of Kittlitz's Murrelets to be held in Long Beach California.

<DESC>Automated Low-Level Analysis and Description of Diverse Intelligence Video (ALADDIN)Proposers' Day Conference
<p>SYNOPSIS<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Automated Low-Level Analysis and Description of Diverse Intelligence Video (ALADDIN) Program on October 30, 2009 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 am to 4:00 pm in the Washington DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on ALADDIN, to address questions from potential proposers and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS<br />Staggering numbers of video clips are produced using all manner of consumer electronic devices. In contrast to videos produced for broadcast or captured in typical security surveillance settings, these "videos in the wild" present a significant challenge for analysis. Such video clips can include essentially any possible scene and events. There are no quality or production standards in lighting, camera control, audio recording, and so on. And, the rate at which video clips of this type are produced is substantial and is growing. The goal of this program is to dramatically improve the speed with which an analyst can review video clips to find events of potential interest.</p>
<p>The ALADDIN program seeks technical innovation in the following areas: efficient sorting and filtering of large repositories of unconstrained video, detection of low-level activities, metadata generation, and analysis and description of complex events. The ALADDIN Program will build upon technical achievements of earlier research and on the state-of-the-art systems in use today for handling the more constrained video formats (including broadcast and security surveillance).</p>
<p>Collaborative efforts/teaming among potential performers will be strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary with computer vision, computer science, machine learning and natural language processing, as appropriate. IARPA anticipates that universities and companies from around the world will participate in this fascinating area of research. Researchers will be able to publish their findings in publicly-available, academic journals.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm EST October 28, 2009 at https://conference.brtrc.com/aladdin_pd/registration. Directions to the conference facility and other materials are available on the website.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 200 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government issued photo identification to enter the conference.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />The late morning and afternoon will include Presentation &amp; Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present organization capabilities and to explore teaming arrangements. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present, will be provided after approval to register for the Conference has been granted. Opportunities to present will be limited by<br />time and will therefore be limited to the first 15 registered respondents with IARPA approved presentations, and the first 50 registered respondents with IARPA approved posters. These presentations are not intended to solicit feedback from the Government, and Government personnel will not be present during the poster session.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.<br />IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>Questions concerning conference &amp; registration can be sent to IARPAevents@brtrc.com<br />Questions regarding the program can be sent to dni-iarpa-baa-10-01@ugov.gov</p>

<SUBJECT>RFI - Monitoring of Compliance with the Transactions and Code Sets, National Provider Identifier and Unique Employer Identifier Rules
<SOLNBR>CMS-RFI-100177
<RESPDATE>111609
<ARCHDATE>11172009
<CONTACT>Denise Buenning, Email OESSRFI@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information</strong>:<br />Monitoring of Compliance with the Transactions and Code Sets, National Provider Identifier and Unique Employer Identifier Rules</p>
<p>Summary: Six years have elapsed since the first effective date of mandatory compliance under the Administrative Simplification provisions of the Health Insurance and Portability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). While the total number of complaints related to Transactions and Code Sets, National Provider Identifier, and Unique Identifier is small in comparison to the size of the industry; some industry representatives believe that the extent of non-compliance is higher than the figures represented in CMS' complaint statistics. In advance of the January 1, 2012 compliance date for the updated X12 version 5010, and NCPDP Version D.0, and 3.0 standards, and the October 1, 2013 compliance deadline for ICD-10 code sets as set forth in the final rules published on January 16, 2009, it is important for CMS to ensure that the industry is in compliance with the current versions of the transactions and code sets. Thus, we are proactively looking at options to improve and enhance the current enforcement process. We have prepared this Request for Information (RFI) to secure industry input on specific topics to help us to refine future strategies for the HIPAA enforcement process. <br />Background for HIPAA Regulations: The final rule, Health Insurance Reform: Standards for Electronic Transactions (TCS), was published on August 17, 2000, and the subsequent Modifications to the HIPAA Electronic Transaction Standards rules were published on February 20, 2003 and January 16, 2009 (final rules). These rules require covered entities (CEs) (health plans, health care clearinghouses, and certain health care providers) to implement standards and code sets for certain electronic transactions, including: health care claims/encounters; health care payment and remittance advice; coordination of benefits (COB); eligibility inquiry and response; health care claim status and response; enrollment and dis-enrollment in a health plan; referral certification and authorization inquiry and response; and health plan premium payments.</p>
<p>On May 31, 2002, the final rule, Health Insurance Reform: Standard Unique Employer Identifier was published and it became effective in July 2002. The rule adopted the Employer Identification Number (EIN) as the standard unique employer identifier and requires CEs to use the EIN in all standard transactions that require an employer identifier to identify a person or entity as an employer. On January 23, 2004, the HIPAA Administrative Simplification: Standard Unique Health Identifier for Health Care Providers final rule was published. It became effective in May 2005, and compliance was required by May 23, 2008. It adopted the National Provider Identifier (NPI) as the standard identifier for all covered health care providers, and requires all CEs to use (send and receive) this identifier in standard transactions.</p>
<p>On February 16, 2006, HHS published the final Enforcement Rule governing the investigation of noncompliance with the HIPAA regulations, and made such investigations and penalties applicable to all of the Administrative Simplification rules, rather than exclusively to the HIPAA privacy standards. <br /><br />Enforcement strategy to date: Enforcement of the HIPAA rules is complaint driven. CMS receives complaints from the public, other government agencies, and covered entities. Each complaint is investigated, typically through a request for additional information or documentation from the complainant, as well as documentation, proof of compliance or a corrective action plan from the filed against entity (FAE). The results of each investigation have often resulted in contract changes, and/or modification to trading partner agreements, procedures or technologies, as appropriate. In some cases, following an entity's immediate steps to mitigate a particular issue, that entity finds other vulnerabilities or procedural issues which are also rectified. In some cases a longer term corrective action plan is developed and is monitored by CMS over an agreed upon period of time.</p>
<p>The 2006 Enforcement Rule also gave CMS the authority to conduct compliance reviews, and in 2007, CMS invoked that authority with respect to the Security Rule. Eleven comprehensive compliance reviews of assorted covered entity types have been conducted to date. Based on the findings, CMS has provided technical assistance and guidance to each of the covered entities.</p>
<p>Prevalence of TCS and Unique Identifier complaints: We have received over 600 TCS complaints since 2005, and 43 NPI complaints since 2008 (but no complaints related to the EIN). We are not certain if these complaints are truly representative of industry's compliance challenges, particularly since more than half of the complaints dealt with the issue of negotiating very specific trading partner agreements. Therefore, additional information about the HIPAA compliance environment could be invaluable in helping CMS better understand the scope of non-compliance issues to better target our approach to both outreach and enforcement.</p>
<p>Nature of current complaints: Though the CMS complaint volume is small, the nature of the allegations we have received lead us to believe that there may still be some challenges with respect to effective implementation of the rules, in spite of the time that has passed since the mandatory compliance date. Examples of some of the complaints we continue to receive are: <br />&bull; Failure to implement the full suite of transactions (e.g. COB, eligibility, referrals and authorizations); <br />&bull; Non-compliance with format or content requirements from the Implementation Guides; <br />&bull; Use of companion guides with requirements that conflict with implementation guides;<br />&bull; Code sets and/or code set rule violations - non-compliant use or non-compliant instructions for uses; <br />&bull; Continued use of legacy provider numbers;<br />&bull; Excessive fees charged by clearinghouses.</p>
<p>We hope that the feedback from this RFI will help us determine if the complaints about compliance are a result of ongoing technical issues with X12 4010 or NCPDP 5.1, or if they are the result of other organizational operational challenges.</p>
<p>Possible barriers to complaints: We understand that some providers have alleged that they would not file a complaint against a health plan for rejecting a compliant transaction, because they fear the health plan will slow or reduce their payment rates, or take other harmful actions. We do not have evidence of such, but would be interested in hearing from the industry if there have in fact been instances of retaliation for such communication. We recognize that some complainants wish to remain anonymous. While there are times when this can be accommodated, there are certain situations in which anonymity is a barrier to resolution, since the name of the affected entity and a sample transaction can assist in researching the complaint. We would like to solicit input on alternative complaint filing processes to create a more conducive environment for complainants.</p>
<p>Future enforcement strategy: Based on the substantive findings of the Security compliance reviews, CMS believes there could be similar benefits from reviews to assess compliance with the requirements of the Transactions, Code Sets and Unique Identifier rules. Possible benefits might include an increase in the use of certain transactions, a decreased reliance on companion guides, and/or an increase in efficiency and compliance.</p>
<p>We believe that a compliance review program would help us to understand and target the major contributing factors to non-compliance. Such information could be instructive in identifying issues related to standards development, implementation planning and execution for future versions of the standards. It could also identify educational gaps, program opportunities and outreach activities for Medicare, Medicaid, and the private sector.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we are soliciting input from the industry to help us to fine-tune the current complaint-driven enforcement process. We are requesting industry input and insight on possible improvements to the current enforcement process as well as the usefulness and structure of a compliance review program. In this RFI, we've outlined a number of topics about which we would like feedback and creative recommendations as follows:</p>
<p>1. Information about the extent of the industry's noncompliance. <br />Describe: (i) key problem areas (technical vs. business); (ii) prevalence of specific TCS, NPI and EIN non-compliance; (iii) patterns of non-compliance among specific transaction types and entity types; and (iv) the extent of implementation of the TCS, NPI and EIN standards.</p>
<p>2. Comments on barriers to complaints being filed, and how to eliminate those barriers.<br /><br />3. Comments on the strength and weakness, with explanation, of the current complaint process.</p>
<p>4. The usefulness of compliance reviews in identifying: (i) problem implementation areas specific to certain covered entity types (ii) problem implementation areas specific to certain transaction types; and (iii) challenges with the standards.</p>
<p>5. The methods that could be employed to execute the compliance reviews, including the process for identifying entities for review.</p>
<p>6. Recommendations for the logistics for conducting compliance reviews.</p>
<p>7. Any alternative enforcement strategies.</p>
<p>Instructions for submittal of Comments:</p>
<p>Comments must be submitted as Microsoft word documents, using Version 2007. Each topic should be clearly delineated with an appropriate heading as noted above, and all recommendations should include specific examples. The submission shall be no more than 6 single-sided, single-spaced pages (excluding the cover page), and use a minimum font of 12 point (Time New Roman). Submissions must be electronic, and to be sent via email to Denise Buenning at OESSRFI@cms.hhs.gov by 5:00 p.m., Monday, November 16, 2009.</p>

However, responses to the RFI submitted may be reflected in a final solicitation. CMS reserves the right to contact any vendor that responds to this RFI for the sole purpose of enhancing CMS' understanding of your RFI submission.</p>
<p>This notice is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this RFI and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with any RFI submissions.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER:  W91278-09-C-0020, R & D Maintenance Service, Inc., 409 N Main St., Hennessey, OK  73742-1017. Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-09-C-0020, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway, Alabama and Mississippi, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services.  The North American Industry Classification Systems Code (NAICS) 561210 applies to this contract. The modification will be funded by American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) funds. Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the contract.  The modification will increase the level of effort required under the current contract as follows: 1) Performing maintenance of Okatibbee Dam to include sand drains at the downstream end of drains and drainage ditch.  Install crushed rock wrapped in non-woven fabric so that seepage is conveyed more efficiently to the toe ditch.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems.   The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) the current contract will enable repairs to the dam to begin immediately after scope of work in completed.  Due to weather construction window for work to be accomplished in the fall of FY-10, construction will be required to start within the next two months. 2)  The Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee Contractor has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost with an advantage of flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during construction.  This flexibility is very important when working on the dam just before flood season, beginning in the winter months. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed- price  (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.<BR>

<SOLNBR>M6785405D7015
<ARCHDATE>11012009
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to procure additional AN/VRC-104 radio systems for the U.S. Marine Corps utilizing a single award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract modification to an existing contract, M67854-05-D-7015, with Harris Corporation of Rochester, NY.  The modification will increase the contract ceiling to allow a single delivery order for 6,100 AN/VRC-104 radio systems.  The estimated dollar value of the anticipated modification is $334,281,300.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements,  the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source to procure the radio systems.  The AN/VRC-104 radio systems consist of PRC-150 High Frequency (HF) Radios and Vehicle Installation Kits (VIK).  These VRC-104 radio systems are a component of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) joint ACAT-1D program and directly support the immediate production requirements of the MRAP-All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV).  In addition, the VRC-104 radio systems serve as the primary vehicular system for long-haul HF communications for the M-ATV and provide over-the-horizon (OTH) communications that overcome rugged environments and direct line of sight (LOS) communication restrictions.  Deliveries are required to commence no later than November of 2009.  Harris Corporation is the only Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certified source of these HF radio vehicular systems.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a determination not to compete this proposed effort on a full-and-open competition basis has been made by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The OC-ALC, Dpartment of the Air Force, proposes to rent aircraft hanger space from the MROTC Facility operated by the Boeing Company located on Douglas Boulevard east of Tinker Air Force Base. The Government intends to procure this commercial service using a sole- source contract supported by a J&A citing FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(B). The Government currently has a short-term need to rent aircraft hanger space only for a short period approx. fortyfour(44) days. The contracting officer belives a FAR Part 12, Acpuisition of Commercial Items, serverable service contract will satisfy the Government's present needs.

IV.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
 
10 USC 2304(c)(1) , as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. IAW FAR 6.304(a)(2) the approval level for this J & A is the Contracting Officer.  

            Space for short-term use of the categorical space delegation of industrial facility space authority for this transaction is the Federal Management Regulation (FMR), A categorical space delegation is a standing delegation of authority from the Administrator of General Services to a  Federal agency to acquire a type of space identified in FMR 102-73.155. Federal agencies can use categorical space delegations to acquire Hangars and other airport operating facilities including, but not limited to, flight preparation space, aircraft. 

 RATIONALE FOR SOLE SOURCE NEGOTIATIONS

Only one property, the MROTC, is able to satisfy 76 AMXG’s needs as described in Section IV, which are essentially to support weapon system requirements without jeopardizing the individual weapon system PDM efforts. The MROTC is the only facility with sufficient High Bay space, proximity to the base, and has the industrial infrastructure to meet 76 AMXG’s requirements.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

Diffuse Reflectometer

We intend to purchase a diffuse reflectometer to measure the diffuse reflectance in determination of the brightness, color, CIE whiteness of pulp, paper and paperboard.  The diffuse reflectometer should have the same of equivalent salient qualities as the Technidyne ColorTouch PC from:
	
			Technidyne
			100 Quality Avenue
			New Albany, IN  47150-2272
			(812) 948-2884
			(812) 945-6847 (fax)

The primary function of the diffuse reflectometer will be to determine the diffuse brightness (at 457nm) and color of pulp, paper, and paperboard.  A suitable reflectometer must show that it meets the paper industry standards: TAPPI T525, TAPPI T525, TAPPI T 527, and TAPPI T 560.  Qualities that are desired for the reflectometer include:

1.	Utilizes an integrating sphere to provide diffuse illumination and perpendicular (0o) observation geometry designated in optical terminology as d/0.
2.	One or more light sources direct light into an integrating sphere which provides diffuse illumination of the specimen.
3.	The integrating sphere has an inside diameter of 150nm and is coated with a matte white paint with absolute reflectance of 96 or greater from the light source. The sphere shall be equipped with screens to eliminate direct illumination of the specimen.
4.	The receptor aperture is surrounded by a gloss trap (black circular area) of external diameter subtending a half-angle of 15.5 + 0.5o at the center of the specimen aperture.
5.	The specimen is viewed perpendicularly (0 o). Only reflected rays within a solid cone, whose vertex is in the center of the specimen aperture and of half-angle not greater than 4 o shall fall on the receptor.
6.	Capable of measuring effective residual ink concentration (ERIC) by infrared reflectance at a spectral wavelength of 950 + 5.0 nm, the bandpass at 50% peak height must not exceed 150 nm, and the bandpass at 10% peak height must not exceed 250 nm.
7.	Capable of measuring diffuse opacity and provide scattering and absorption powers and coefficients along with contrast ratios at d/0 geometry and illuminant C.
8.	Capable of having testing data generate be downloaded into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.
9.	Capable of measuring fluorescence.

<DESC>To better understand the amount of recreation use and user satisfaction on the National Forests, the USDA Forest Service is surveying users on all forests through a random sampling system over the next four years.  The Caribou-Targhee National Forest is being sampled during the fiscal year 2010. 

The Caribou-Targhee National Forest has 268 surveys to be taken beginning December 20, 2009 through September 30, 2010.   Actual duration of the survey (when applicable) takes 6 hours at the site.  In addition, road and or trail traffic counters (as required) shall be placed to count traffic for a 24 hour period of time, which includes the survey time. AM surveys take place between 8am and 2pm.  PM surveys take place between 2pm and 8pm.  Survey times may be adjusted by the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) as needed to avoid conducting surveys before sunrise or after dark.

It is important that each survey be completed on the prescribed date and time as indicated on the attached schedule. No tolerance is allowed for convenience to persons performing the survey. The only reason for a survey to be delayed would be that the site is physically closed or access to the site is blocked.

The actual survey sites are situated at specified Forest Developed Recreation Sites or other dispersed area locations on or near the National Forest. Maps will be available at the pre-bid meeting, which shows the location of each survey site.

Accessibility by motor vehicle is generally good during the normal summer season - except those sites located in the Jedediah Smith Wilderness, which must be accessed by foot or horse (no motorized or mechanized vehicle use is permitted inside wilderness areas).   

Some of the more remote sites will only be accessible by snowmobile during the winter months (snowshoes or x-c skies could be used but keep in mind equipment such as signs and counters need to be carried to the sites).  Most survey sites are reached by graded roads as a minimum, and paved roads in some cases. Weather and wet road conditions could make access difficult in some of the more remote locations.

A preproposal meeting will be held at 1405 Hollipark Drive, Idaho Falls, ID 83401, on October 28, 2009 at 10:00 a.m.  Attendance is highly encouraged.

FAR clauses and provisions are available through Internet access at www.acqnet.gov/far.  This solicitation is 100% small business set-aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990.   The small business size standard is $33.5 million. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded for these Commercial Items.
This acquisition is for the supply and delivery of an articulating concrete block revetment system at two locations at Big Bend National Park, Texas. Revetment system will be used for boat ramp access along the Rio Grande River. River access is primarily for canoe and raft use. Installation shall be performed by park maintenance staff.  Locations and respective system dimensions are as follows:
1.	Santa Elena River Access, MP 6, Rt 16, near Castolon  	24'wide x 80'long2.	Boquillas River Access in Rio Grande Village		16'wide x 80'long	            Revetment system includes: a.  Prefabricated assembly of cellular concrete blocks, with specific hydraulic capacities, laced with revetment cables. Delivery shall include the use/rental of a spreader bar at the site, if needed, for two weeks.b.  Geotextile Fabric c.  Design to performance specs below; submit design drawings for each site for review and approvald.  Order includes delivery to each site.
Performance Specificationsa.  Revetment system shall withstand typical river flows at 2-3 feet/second.b. Revetment system shall withstand typical flood flows of 9-10 feet/second.c.  Grade at each site is between 14-16%.d.  Revetment system shall support wheeled loaders (40,000 GVW) used to remove sediment deposits from high water events.
Cellular Concrete Mats: Shall be prefabricated as an assembly of concrete blocks, with specific hydraulic capacities noted, laced with revetment cables. Individual units in the system shall be staggered and interlocked for enhanced stability. The mats shall be constructed of open cell units with two (2) vertical opening of rectangular cross section with sufficient wall thickness to resist breakage during shipping and installation. Parallel strands of cable shall extend through two (2) caged ducts in each block allowing for longitudinal binding of the units within a mat. Each row of units shall be laterally offset by one-half of a block width form the adjacent row so that any given block is cabled to four other blocks (two in the row above and two in the row below).Each block shall incorporate interlocking surfaces that minimize lateral displacement of the blocks within the mats when they are lifted by the longitudinal revetment cables. The interlocking surfaces must not protrude beyond the perimeter of the blocks to such an extent that they reduce the flexibility or articulation capability of the cellular mats or become damaged or broken when the mats are lifted during shipment or placement. Once the mats are in place, the interlocking surfaces shall minimize the lateral displacement of the blocks even if the cables should become damaged or removed. The mats must be able to flex a minimum of 18 between any given row or column of blocks in the uplift direction and a minimum of 45 in the downward direction.
The cables inserted into the mats shall form lifting loops at one end of the mat with the corresponding cable ends spliced together to form a lifting loop at the other end of the mat. The Owner shall approve appropriate sleeves for use in order to splice the lifting loop. The cables shall be inserted after sufficient time has allowed for the concrete to complete the curing process. Cables shall be galvanized steel. 
Cellular concrete mats will only be accepted when accompanied by documented hydraulic performance characteristics that are derived from tests under controlled flow conditions. Testing guidelines should conform to U.S. Federal Highway Administration and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Testing Protocol as documented in "Minimizing Embankment Damage During Overtopping Flow", Report No. FHWA-RD-88-181 and all hydraulic performance testing shall be performed in a 2H:1V flume.
Geotextile Fabric: Geotextile filter shall meet the physical requirements below:	Physical Property	                          Test Procedure	Minimum Value
Grab Tensile Strength(Unaged Geotextile)	             ASTM D4632	200 Lbs.(in any principal direction)
Breaking Elongation(Unaged Geotextile)	             ASTM D4632	50% max (in any principal direction)
Burst Strength	                              ASTM D3786	400 psi
Puncture Strength	                              ASTM D4833	115 lbs

The geotextile must be permitted to function properly by allowing relief of hydrostatic pressure; therefore fine soil particles shall not be allowed to clog the filter fabric.
The geotextile fiber shall consist of a long-chain synthetic polymer composed of at least 85 percent by weight of propylene, ethylene, ester or amide and shall contain stabilizers and/or inhibitors added to the base plastic, if necessary to make the filaments resistant to deterioration due to ultraviolet and heat exposure.

Title:  Policy and Regulatory Legal Assistance on Geologic Resource Management Issues Facing Units of the National Park System
Description:
The Geologic Resources Division is one of five divisions within the National Park Service (NPS)'s Natural Resource Program Center.  The Division provides parks, regions, networks and the Washington Office with expertise on minerals management, disturbed lands restoration, geohazards, soil and geologic inventories, planning, and management of specialized geologic resources like cave and karst, fossils, and coastal resources.  Legal assistance provided often requires the interpretation of statutes, regulations and case law, and the development of policy and guidance documents.  
At present, the number of issues warranting research and analysis outpaces the in-house capability of staff.  As a result, the Geologic Resources Division seeks to obtain assistance from a Contractor in carrying out policy and regulatory research and analysis on several key issues.  
For example, at present, a key project the division is working on is the development of a rule making package to revise the NPS's nonfederal oil and gas regulations at 36 CFR Part 9, Subpart B.  The NPS promulgated these regulations back in 1978, over 30 years ago.  Over that time much has changed in the regulated community of oil and gas operators and in the sphere of the regulator.  New scientific data, innovations in extraction and mitigation techniques, and alternative incentive programs have emerged underscoring the need for the NPS to improve how it handles the identification of potential impacts, available mitigation measures, and regulatory compliance requirements.  As part of this rulemaking effort the NPS needs help in drafting regulatory language, carrying out regulatory compliance responsibilities, evaluating existing regulatory approaches being implemented by state and other federal agencies, addressing questions on evolving case law pertinent to the regulation of oil and gas operations, generating ideas on how to integrate and utilize new information technology in its permitting system in compliance with federal statutes and executive orders, and understanding how it can help mitigate the production of greenhouse gases at oil and gas facilities covered by its regulatory program in parks.
Scope of Work:
The NPS intends to award a contract to gain the support of a Contractor to prepare independent analyses and to provide legal expertise related to answering short-term questions related to geologic resource management issues.
Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide the NPS with all labor, and services necessary to conduct the needed research and prepare the requested documents in electronic format.  The Contractor must be locatdd withiin the commuting distance of Lakewood, Colorado.
Specific research and analytical needs include the following:
I. Renewable Energy Development  
1.	Development of a framework for collecting storing and displaying data regarding energy projects currently taking place, and proposed for future use, near units of the National Park System.  Specifically, the contractor will collect, analyze and display such data for parks within the Pacific West Region and the Intermountain Region. 
2.	Develop fact sheets on issues related to the following renewable energy technologies: solar, wind, geothermal and hydrokinetics.  The fact sheets will contain technical, environmental, legal and policy information for use by park resource managers.  
3.	Develop a report on the United States Forest Service's (USFS) permitting activities relative to renewable energy projects - both planned and already permitted projects on USFS lands.  This report will include the following:
a).	A description of the regulatory framework,b).	The identification of opportunities for NPS involvement in that process,c).	The identification of areas open to renewable energy projects in proximity to park units, andd).	Recommendations for action.
4.	Provide assistance in the development of an energy website, designed for NPS staff.
5.	Undertake discrete analysis on issues related to protecting park resources from energy development outside park boundaries. 
II. Non-Federal Oil and Gas 
The Geologic Resources Division has recently initiated efforts to revise its regulations at 36 CFR Part 9, Subpart B ("9B").  The NPS is currently preparing administrative notices, a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, and draft regulatory language.  The Contractor shall:
1.	Assist with drafting regulatory text.
2.	Assist with carrying out rulemaking compliance responsibilities.
3.	Develop and populate a digital administrative record on the rulemaking effort.
4.	Develop an analysis of 109 existing access-exempt non-federal oil and gas operations as to where they are located relative to federal land in the boundary of a given park and the nature of the protection concerns raised by these exempt operations.
5.	Prepare memorandums addressing an array of questions arising in the context of the rulemaking effort, such as, the scope of criminal penalties under federal statute, state bonding requirements, how other agencies track and deal with permit violators, mechanisms for allowing permittees to submit information in a paperless fashion, and case studies on the use of third party monitors of operations to assure compliance with regulatory requirements.
III. Ocean and Coastal Park Guidance
The NPS has recently completed a first draft of an Ocean and Coastal Guidance Handbook.  This handbook discusses and explains NPS policy and regulatory power regarding various issues facing ocean and coastal parks.  Such issues include commercial and recreational fishing, aquaculture, commercial and recreational boating, invasive species, recreation, water quality, sediment management, and sand rights.  The Handbook is currently being reviewed by NPS staff as well as staff from the Department of the Interior's Office of the Solicitor.   The Geologic Resources Division is currently receiving comments on the handbook.  The Contractor shall:
1.	Collect and analyze comments on the current draft of the Ocean and Coastal Handbook.
2.	Research any and all questions raised in comments received.
3.	Draft guidance language and include it in the Handbook.	
Quote  MUST be good for 90 calendar days after close of RFQ.

<p>FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers (in descending order of importance): (1) the Vessel Capabilities and Physical Characteristics, (2) Construction and Technical Capability and Quality Assurance, (3) Warranty Terms and Warranty Process, (4) Relevant Past Performance, and (5) Price.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the quotes against the following five factors:</p>
<p>(1) VESSEL CAPABILITIES AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</p>
<p>&bull; Offeror quotes shall demonstrate, in clear detail, its capabilities and equipment intended to meet or exceed all specification requirements or it will not be considered. Evaluations will be based on the degree to which the offers exceed minimum requirements and attain offerings of added value if any. The submission of drawings is required.</p>
<p>&bull; The Offeror shall have not less than five years experience in designing and manufacturing of comparable aluminum vessels.</p>
<p>&bull; The Offeror shall have built a minimum of five hulls of similar style in the past three years.</p>
<p>(2) CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNCIAL CAPABILITY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE: <br />Offeror's quote shall demonstrate its ability to:</p>
<p>&bull; Construct and test the Work Boat;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide the technical expertise with qualified/certified employees;</p>
<p>&bull; Prevent discrepancies;</p>
<p>&bull; Responsively correct deficiencies as they are identified;</p>
<p>&bull; Inspect/certify assurance the product conforms to the specification requirements; and</p>
<p>&bull; Produce and deliver the work boat by the delivery date.</p>
<p>NOTE: "Deficiencies", as listed under this non-price factor, indicate where the work boat is not in conformance with the commercial items specified in the quoter's quote and the EPA specification.</p>
<p>(3) WARRANTY TERMS AND WARRANTY PROCESS: <br /><br />The Government will evaluate each Quoter's warranty plan. The warranty plan shall include responses to the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Offeror's plan for travel to Government unit locations with the proper tools and equipment to perform warranty repair work on the boat when it is determined that the repair work is covered under the warranty.</p>
<p>&bull; Warranty coverage of all parts, labor, and travel expenses in association with warranty repair work for the boat if the repair is covered under the warranty.</p>
<p>&bull; Warranty provision permitting the Government to perform all scheduled maintenance with its own personnel or by contract without voiding warranty coverage or endangering Government warranty rights.</p>
<p>&bull; Means and method for handling disputed warranty claims.</p>
<p>(4) RELEVANT PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>&bull; The Government's intent is to evaluate each quoters past performance quality, including quality of product; price control; timeliness of performance; business relationships; and customer satisfaction, to determine whether the Quoter consistently delivered quality products in a timely manner in the past. This factor will be evaluated on the basis of relevant past performance for the Quoters during the last three (3) years, including performance on contracts of similar financial scope, on contracts for a similar quantity of boats with the same design, or same family of designs to the boat proposed. The information presented in the Quoters' quotes, together with information from any other sources available to the Government (e.g., Government-controlled Contractor performance databases and references including contractual, technical, and end-user representatives) may provide input for the evaluation of this factor.</p>
<p>&bull; A lack of any relevant past performance information will be treated by the Government as a "Neutral" under this factor.</p>
<p>(5) PRICE:</p>
<p>&bull; The total overall evaluated price shall determine price completeness, accuracy, and price reasonableness. An evaluation of the Quoters' price quotes will be made to determine if they are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the technical quote. Price reasonableness will be evaluated based on the receipt of competitive offers and comparisons to published commercial pricing of Quoters' and others' products and to the independent government estimate.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br /><br />The basis for award will be best value, which will be based on consideration of the following factors (in descending order of importance): (1) the Vessel Operational Capabilities and Physical Characteristics, (2) Construction and Logistics Capability and Quality Assurance, (3) Warranty Terms and Warranty Process, (4) Relevant Past Performance, and (5) Price. All non-price factors when combined are more important than Price.</p>
<p>&bull; As the technical quotes become closer in quality, price increases in relative importance.</p>
<p>The Government may elect to pay a premium price to select an Offeror that offers a boat providing greater advantages in the non-price evaluation criteria and/or is technically superior to the boats of lower priced offers.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION:<br /><br />The technical evaluation will be attained through a determination and analysis of strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and deficiencies. Technical risk will be included in the final evaluation of each factor and will not be evaluated as a separate factor. Technical risk is an overall assessment derived from the technical evaluation and is inclusive of each evaluation factor. In the assessment of technical risk, Government evaluators will consider all available information submitted in the quote.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERICAL ITEMS (AUG 2009) Alternate I (APR 2000) and Alternate II (OCT 2000)</p>

These services may consist of development/update of transportation systems engineering criteria.  Knowledge of the Armys RAILER computer program should be noted, but is not a selection criterion and is not required for selection.  <BR>Construction cost estimates may be required for any of the design tasks listed above. Construction cost estimates will be prepared using the Corps of Engineers Micro-Computer Aided Cost Estimating System (M-CACES) Second Generation (MII). (M-CACES software will be provided to the successful firm after contract award).<BR><BR><BR>Evaluation Ratings:  The source selection process will use an evaluation rating based on the application of a scale of words, used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard for a non-cost factor.  For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives.  Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level.  If at any level of indentation an Offerors proposal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirement (that is, below the level of Satisfactory), this fact may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation.  Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level.  The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<BR>(i)	Outstanding  - Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards.  The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.  Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.  The offerors qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government.  The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the RFP requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under the contract.  Significantly exceeds most or all solicitation requirements.  Very high probability of success.<BR><BR>(ii)	Above Average  - Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to exceed performance or capability standards.  Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government.  The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.  The offerors qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements.  The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government.  Fully meets all RFP requirements and significantly exceed many of the RFP requirements. Disadvantages are minimal.  High probability of success.<BR><BR>(iii)	Satisfactory (Neutral) - Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to meet performance or capability standards.  Acceptable solution.  Either meets all RFP requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas.  A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved.  The proposal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the RFP requirements.  No significant advantages or disadvantages.  Equates to neutral. Good probability of success.<BR><BR>(iv)	Marginal - The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion).   The offerors interpretation of the Governments requirements is so superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect as to be considered deficient.  Proposal does not meet some of the minimum requirements.  The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall project.  The offerors qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government.  Low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable.  Significant disadvantages.<BR><BR>                            (v)   Unsatisfactory  - Fails to meet performance or capability standards.  Requirements can only be met with major changes to the submittal.  There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved.  The proposal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Governments requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum requirements. Very significant disadvantages.<BR><BR>SUBMISSION AND SELECTION CRITERIA FOR ACQUISITION: Criteria for selection, in order of importance, are:<BR><BR>(a) Demonstrate recent experience and technical competence of the firm (including consultants).

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COCO Alert 08-33: Attachment 1 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice for Filing Agency Protests <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 

	J.1. These instructions prescribe the format for the proposal, and describe the approach for the development and presentation of the proposed data.  The proposal shall include all of the information requested in the specific instructions.  Failure to include all information requested may adversely affect the evaluation.  A proposal that merely reiterates or promises to accomplish the requirements of the RFP may be considered unacceptable.  A proposal that is orderly and sufficiently documented will be easy for the Government to understand and will enable the Government to perform a fair and thorough evaluation. This RFP does not commit the Government to pay costs incurred in preparation and submission of proposal information. 
	J.2. Offerors are cautioned to submit enough information to enable the Government to fully ascertain each offeror’s capability to perform all of the requirements contemplated by this solicitation.  All commitments made in the proposal may become a part of the resultant contract.  The data submitted with each proposal should be complete and concise, but not overly elaborate. Any materials submitted but not required by this solicitation, (such as company brochures), shall be relegated to appendices.  Excessive reliance on promotional brochures is discouraged.

	J.3.Binding. Elaborate format and binding are neither necessary nor desirable.  All binders, (3 ring type is preferred) will be capable of lying flat when opened.  The cover and spine of each binder will clearly identify the offeror’s name, RFP number, RFP title and copy number, (e.g. copy 2 of 3).  The original for each volume will be clearly identified on the cover and the spine.  All binders will allow for easy removal and replacement of pages.  Submit the original and three copies of your proposal.

		J.4. Offeror may, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, be asked to provide clarifications regarding their proposals.  The offeror shall be held responsible for the validity of all information supplied in their proposal.  Should subsequent investigation disclose that the facts and conditions were not as stated, the proposal may be rejected or contract terminated for default after the contract award.

	J.5. Each proposal shall give the complete mailing address of the contractor and be signed by an authorized representative by original signature with his or her name and legal title typed below the signature line.  If the contract’s contact will be a different entity, indicate that individual’s contact information for communication purposes.  Each proposal shall include the contractor's tax number.

	J.6. A contractor may modify a proposal by letter or by FAX transmission at any time prior to the closing date and time for receipt of proposals. 

	J.7. A proposal may be withdrawn on written request from the vendor to the Point-of-Contact at the Division of Facilities Management prior to the closing date.

              J.8  Any explanation desired by an offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of the solicitation must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for a reply to reach offerors before the submission of their offer.  All questions and requests for information (RFI) must be received NOT LATER THAN ten (10) calendar days prior to closing date of the solicitation.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to address questions received after this time following solicitation closing with those offerors in the competitive range should one be established.  Any interpretations made will be in the form of an amendment of the solicitation and will be furnished to all prospective offerors via posting to www.fbo.gov .  Receipt of an amendment by the offeror must be acknowledged in the space provided on the SF 33, or by returning a signed copy of the amendment by the time set for receipt of proposals.  Explanations or instructions given in a form other than an amendment to the solicitation shall not be binding.  Any questions or requests for clarifications, and information concerning this solicitation must be submitted in writing by email, to the contracting specialist at robert.parvin@us.army.mil. 
.
	J.9. The right is reserved, as the interest of the Government may require, to revise or amend, the solicitation, specifications prior to and/or after the date set for receipt of proposals, as necessary.  Such changes, if any, will be announced by an amendment or amendments to this Request for Proposal.  All information relating to this RFP, including pertinent changes/amendments and other information applicable prior to the date set for receipt of proposals will be posted on the following website: www.fbo.gov.   Though every effort will be made to provide email notification when a change is posted, such notification is NOT guaranteed and should not be expected.   Offerors are strongly cautioned to check this site frequently and to “refresh” their web page to ensure they have the latest information.  

	J.10.   If the offeror takes exception to any of the requirements specified in this solicitation, the offeror shall clearly identify each such exception and include a complete explanation of why the exception was taken and what benefit accrues to the Government.  All exceptions to the solicitation requirements and supporting rationale shall be included in an addendum to the proposal and clearly labeled "Exceptions".  An addendum is only required if the offeror takes exception to any requirement in the solicitation.  (The Addendum does not have a page limitation, but shall only include information relevant to exceptions taken to the solicitation requirements.)  The Government will assume an offeror takes no exceptions to any solicitation requirement if the offeror does not submit an Addendum identifying exceptions.  Offerors are advised that solicitation requirements are not necessarily negotiable and such exceptions may render an offeror's proposal unacceptable and ineligible for award.

<DESC><p>Question:<br />The solicitation references the finished size of the magazine as an A5. I want to clarify that this is the finished size of the piece and that the piece does not need to fit into an A5 envelope. If it is going to go into an A5 envelope the finished size would need to be slightly smaller. Is the exact finished size 5.8"x8.3" and not going into an envelope once received in Germany?<br /><br />Answer:<br />The finished product is to be A5 size - not slightly reduced (this European size was chosen based on the fact that we expected or assumed a local source to be used). The magazine is to be openly distributed; not placed in any envelope.</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Can the graphic files be uploaded to an FTP site?<br /><br />Answer:<br />I don't see any problem in uploading a file to a vendor's ftp site. (If they wish to pull it, we do not have an ftp site).</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>need to clarify shipping options from Ohio. If the magazine is shipped commercially it will need to be inspected by German Customs which will slow the delivery time down greatly. If shipped APO we would get rid of the Customs issue and it could be delivered directly to Ramstein, however, I would assume that a printed piece would be low on the shipping priority. Do you have a preferred method for shipping and a contact person I could call to verify the exact method, process, and cost.<br /><br />Answer:<br />As for shipping, that is always an issue. If shipped through the APO system, we are at the mercy of the mail system and could suffer shipping delays, particularly around the holidays, and most likely would be at a higher cost. If shipped commercially, as stated, it will have to clear Customs through TMO. So long as the packages are addressed and shipped correctly, commercial shipment should be OK. We have been having pretty good luck lately with DHL and UPS properly clearing through TMO Customs but that is not a guarantee. Also, the vendor would need to be able to guarantee delivery by our deadline.</p>
<p>*Additionally, shipping costs would need to fall within the funding of the order and would need to be paid up front by the vendor.</p>
<p>As to their suggestion of using a military transport flying out of Wright-Patt, that is irrelevant and totally out of the question - it's not an option</p>
<p>Question:<br />The specs state that the magazine needs to be delivered "stapled" - I believe it means "saddle stitch" binding - two staples keeping the sheets from falling out. Please clarify.<br /><br />Answer:<br />Yes, "stapled" means bound in this instance, whether saddle-stapled, saddle-stitched, or otherwise, just so long as it is bound (in a neat and professional manner).</p>

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, any specialty metals incorporated in items delivered under this contract shall be melted or produced in the United States, its outlying areas, or a qualifying country, except for—
(1) Electronic components;
(2) (i) Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items; other than—
(A) COTS fasteners, unless such fasteners are incorporated into COTS end items, subsystems, assemblies, or components.
(B) Forgings or castings of specialty metals, unless such forgings or castings are incorporated into COTS end items, subsystems, or assemblies.
(C) Commercially available high performance magnets, unless such high performance magnets are incorporated into COTS end items or subsystems;
(ii) A COTS item is considered to be “offered without modification” as long as it is not modified prior to contractual acceptance by the next higher tier in the supply chain.
(A) Specialty metals contained in a COTS item that was accepted without modification by the next higher tier are excepted and remain excepted even if a piece of the COTS item subsequently is removed (e.g., the end is removed from a COTS screw or an extra hole is drilled in a COTS bracket).
(B) For specialty metals that were not contained in a COTS item upon acceptance, but are added to the COTS item after acceptance, the added specialty metals are subject to the restrictions (e.g., a special reinforced handle made of specialty metal that is added to a COTS item).
(C) If two or more COTS items are combined in such a way that the resultant item is not a COTS item, only the specialty metals involved in joining the COTS items together are subject to the restrictions (e.g., a COTS aircraft is outfitted with a COTS engine, but not a COTS engine normally provided with that aircraft.)
(D) For COTS items that are normally sold in the commercial marketplace with various options, items that include such options are also COTS items. However, if a COTS item is offered to the Government with an option that is not normally offered in the commercial marketplace, that option is subject to the specialty metals restrictions. (e.g., An aircraft is normally sold to the public with an option for several different radios. DoD requests a military-unique radio. The aircraft is still a COTS item, but the military-unique radio is not a COTS item, and must comply with the specialty metals restrictions, unless another excerption applies.)
(3) Fasteners that are commercial items that are purchased under a contract or subcontract with a manufacturer of such fasteners, if the manufacturer has certified that it will purchase, during the relevant calendar year, an amount of domestically melted specialty metal, in the required form, for use in the production of fasteners for sale to the Department of Defense and other customers, that is not less than 50% of the total amount of the specialty metal that it will purchase to carry out the production of such fasteners for all customers.
(4) Items manufactured in a qualifying country;
(5) Items for which the Government has determined in accordance with 225.700x-3 of Class Deviation 2008-O0002 that specialty metal melted or produced in the United States cannot be acquired as and when needed in—
(i) A satisfactory quality;
(ii) A sufficient quantity; and
(iii) The required form.
(6) Specialty metals, other than specialty metals in high performance magnets, that do not meet any of the exceptions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this clause, if the total weight of such noncompliant metals does not exceed 2 percent of the total weight of specialty metals in the item, as estimated in good faith by the Contractor.

(c) (1) Streamlined compliance for commercial derivative military articles. As an alternative to the compliance required in paragraph (b) of this clause, the Contractor may purchase an amount of domestically melted specialty metals in the required form, for use during the period of contract performance in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article, In the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause if—
(i) This is an acquisition of commercial derivative military articles; and
(ii) The Contractor has certified in its offer in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause.
(2) Certification for streamlined compliance for commercial derivative military articles (to be submitted with offer when applicable). The offeror [  ] certifies  [  ] does not certify that prior to award it will have entered into a contractual agreement or agreements to purchase an amount of domestically melted or produced specialty metal in the required form for use during the period of contract performance in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article, that is not less than the Contractor’s good faith estimate of the greater of—
(i) An amount equivalent to 120% of the amount of specialty metal that is required to carry out the production of the commercial derivative military article (including the work performed under each subcontract); or
(ii) An amount equivalent to 50% of the amount of specialty metal that is purchased by the contractor and its subcontractors for use during such period in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article.
(3) For the purposes of the certification in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the amount of specialty metal that is required to carry out the production of the commercial derivative military article includes specialty metal contained in any item, including commercially available off-the-shelf items, incorporated into such commercial derivative military article.

(d) Unless the Contractor has certified in accordance with paragraph (c), the Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, excluding paragraph (c) but including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts for articles containing specialty metals.

(a) Invoice payments—
(5) Computing penalty amount. The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.
(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the  7th  day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivers the supplies or performs the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.

Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.

Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.

Registered in the CCR database means that--

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record “Active”.

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation “DUNS” or “DUNS +4” followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--

(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or

(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

(ix) Line of business (industry).

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

(End of clause)

52.211-13     TIME EXTENSIONS (SEP 2000)

Time extensions for contract changes will depend upon the extent, if any, by which the changes cause delay in the completion of the various elements of construction. The change order granting the time extension may provide that the contract completion date will be extended only for those specific elements related to the changed work and that the remaining contract completion dates for all other portions of the work will not be altered. The change order also may provide an equitable readjustment of liquidated damages under the new completion schedule.

52.232-33  PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER—CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)

(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term “EFT” refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.

(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--

(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or

(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).

(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.

(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.

(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 

(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--

(i) Making a correct payment;

(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and

(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.

(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--

(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or

(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.

(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.

(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.

(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.

After receiving the notice, the Contractor shall immediately take corrective action.  If the Contractor fails or refuses to promptly take corrective action, the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping all or part of the work until satisfactory corrective action has been taken.

	J.16. Offerors lacking relevant present/past performance experience may submit information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement if such information is relevant to this acquisition. Such information shall, as a minimum, include: (1) Name(s) of Predecessor Company/Subcontractor and/or Key Personnel; (2) Complete Address: (3) Telephone, Fax Number and email address; (4) Brief synopsis of the experience (a resume may be submitted for "Key Personnel") (5) Describe in detail relevancy to this project.   Note that use of subcontractors or key personnel to obtain relevant past performance shall commit the offeror to use the proposed personnel/subcontractors in the performance of the contract. 

 	J.17 Evaluation: Relative Experience and Past Performance:  The SSEB shall evaluate relative Past Performance by considering such factors as similarity of test cell, an offeror's business practices, customer relationship, offerors ability to successfully perform on prior relevant contracts.  The SSEB will consider in their evaluation recent and relevant past performance and responses to prior client’s questionnaires.  Current, Relevant, Trends:  Evaluators will consider the current, relevant and trends of the performance information while conducting its performance evaluation.  Current is performance occurring within the past five (5) years prior to the solicitation release date.  Within this period, performance occurring later in the period may have greater significance than work occurring earlier in the period.

	J.18. Based on the evaluation results, the proposal will be assigned one of five (5) confidence ratings.  The ratings and related definitions that will be used to define the confidence the Government has in the offeror’s ability to successfully perform the contract work.

	J.19. An offeror with no Past Performance may receive a rating based on the evaluation of its predecessor companies, key personnel, and/or subcontractors. These ratings may not have the same weight as the ratings of the proposing company.   If such information is not applicable (i.e., the offeror does not have a predecessor company, key personnel or subcontractors with relevant experience), the offeror shall be evaluated as "neutral”. However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant Past Performance history, while rated ”Neutral” in Past Performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offerors. 

	J.20. In evaluating performance confidence, the Government may contact your references for additional information and to assure validity of the received questionnaires. The Government may contact sources other than those provided by the offeror for information with respect to past performance. These other sources may include, but are not limited to telephone interviews, and Government personnel with personal knowledge of the offeror’s performance capability.  The Government reserves the rights to obtain and evaluate past performance information from any source it deems appropriate.

	J.21. In accordance with FAR 15.106(a)(2), if award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposals, e.g., the relevance of an offeror's past performance information or to resolve minor clerical errors. Offerors shall be provided an opportunity to address any negative past performance information about which the Offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. 
Thursday, January 31, 2008

	J.22. Organization and Technical Approach.  This information considers the offeror’s proposed technical approach to executing compliance with the Statement of Work.. 

	J.23.	Organization:  Describe what firms, their resources and how their resources will be utilized, their roles and responsibilities and any contractual arrangements that have been established.

		J.25. Describe your quality control approach, corporate systems and capabilities to maintain quality control of the project.  Describe the proposed quality control organization, including the proposed staffing plan.  The Government is interested in demonstrable capabilities to assure quality control and how the offeror will maintain quality control throughout the project.
	
	J.26.  The Contractor shall identify in their proposal a Project Manager who will function as the single point of contact between the Contractor and Government.  The proposal must contain a resume of experience this individual has in the supervising and oversight of the Dyno design, manufacture and installation process. The Contractor’s Project Manager shall be responsible to develop and furnish to the Government within 45 days from date of contract award a detailed project schedule that will enable the tracking of progress and action item status.  The proposal shall include a preliminary schedule showing critical milestones in the design, manufacture, and installation and testing of the provided test cell. 

		 
	J.27. Evaluation: Organization and Technical Approach -- The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and any deficiencies in the offeror’s proposal and understanding of the Dyno technical and functional requirements.  The evaluation will include the offeror’s capability to execute the project. Some additional specific evaluation considerations are listed below.  However, this list is not all-inclusive. 

	J.28. Organization:  The SSEB will evaluate the clarity and strength of the overall technical approach and how well the proposal defines the process they will utilize to execute the entire scope of work.  
	
	J.29. Processes during Design and Construction:  The SSEB will evaluation the realism of the preliminary schedule showing the critical milestones in the design, manufacture, installation and training proposed for the test cell.  The evaluation will include the prior experience of the Project Manager in delivery of similar Dyno projects.   
	
	J.30. The SSEB will evaluate the offeror technical approach to designing and constructing the turn key Dyno test cell.  They will evaluate the proposal as to how each element of the Statement of Work was addressed in the proposal indicating understanding of the requirement and how they intended to satisfy the overall Dyno performance requirements.  The SSEB will evaluate the offeror’s warranty and specific exclusions in the one-year warranty.   

	J.31. The SSEB will evaluate the offeror’s quality control approach, corporate systems and capabilities to maintain quality control of the project.  They will evaluate the offeror’s quality control organization, including the proposed staffing plan and how the offeror will maintain quality control throughout the project.

	J.32. Oral Presentation:  Upon receipt of all written proposals the SSEB shall schedule and interview all offerors determined to be within the competitive range. Oral presentation will not be scored or evaluated separately.   Oral presentations will normally be followed by a SSEB question and answer period for clarification purposes. The location for presentations will be provided with the presentation date and time assignment.  The purpose of the oral presentations is to provide the offeror with the opportunity to briefly explain any specific documentation provided, to highlight the special features of their proposal, and to identify the benefits of the offeror’s technical data proposal.  Any betterments or deviations that the offeror wishes the Government to consider should be discussed in detail in the oral presentation. The offeror is expected to highlight significant technical points contained in their proposal but will not be permitted to submit anything new, but may expand on anything contained in the proposal. Offerors are cautioned that all information provided, regardless of the format, i.e. written proposal, oral presentation, shall be considered as proposal information, and used in the evaluation process.

 
Section K - Evaluation Factors for Award

(See Section L for proposal submission and evaluation of selection factor) 
              K.1 Basis of Award:  The award shall be based on the evaluation of three factors: (1) Relevant Past Performance (2) Organization and Technical Approach and (3) Price (within the stipulated price limitation).  Evaluated within the factor Organization and Technical Approach include two sub factors (1) Demonstrated compliance with the SOW and (2) Demonstrated understanding the requirements of the facility addition/enclosure.  Relevant Past Performance and Organization and Technical Approach is approximately equal in value and when combined is more important than price, provided the price is within the stipulated price limitation.   Adjective evaluation ratings (shown below) will be provided for Relative Past Performance and Organization and Technical Approach.    
	      K.2. Price:   The purpose of the price/cost evaluation is to determine whether an offeror’s proposed prices/costs for the project are reasonable and realistic in relation to the solicitation requirements and demonstrates an offerors understanding of the proposal requirements.  Price is not separately rated.

	a. The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine whether or not each proposal complies with the stated criteria: "Reasonableness" and Realism". In determining overall cost to the Government for evaluation and selection purposes, the price proposed by an offeror who provides benefits/betterments within the stipulated price limitation may be afforded greater consideration than on offeror who proposes a lower price for basic requirements. 

	b. Price evaluation will consider reasonableness and realistic prices associated with the offeror’s overall technical proposal solution.  Those proposals evaluated as not satisfying all of the price/cost criteria may be eliminated from further consideration unless the Contracting Officer determines:  A minor clerical error has occurred, then the offeror may be given an opportunity to correct the minor error within the constraints of the "clarifications" process or the Contracting Officer determines discussions are required.  Reasonableness of an offeror's proposal is evaluated through price analysis techniques as described in FAR Subpart 15.305(a)(1) and (4).  

	c. For the price to be reasonable, it must represent a price that provides value to the Government when consideration is given to prices in the market, technical and functional capabilities of the offeror. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.  For price to be realistic, it must reflect what it would cost the offeror to perform the effort if the offeror operates with reasonable economy and efficiency. 

	d. Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly explained in the price proposal.  For example, if unique and innovative approaches or conditions are the basis for an unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented.  The burden of proof of price realism rests solely with the offeror.

	K.3. The Contracting Officer will award a firm fixed price contract to that responsible Offeror whose proposal the Source Selection Authority has determined conforms to the solicitation, is fair and reasonable, and the offers the best overall value to the Government, considering all non-priced factors described herein, and price. All evaluation factors, other than price, when combined are considered approximately equal to price, however the contract award price shall not exceed $1,570,000.00.   The intent of this solicitation is to obtain the best proposal within the cost limitation. There is no obligation to approach or match the cost limitation in the offer.  After the Government individually evaluates and rates each proposal, the Contracting Officer/Source Selection Authority will compare the RFP requirements to determine which proposal represents the best value.  The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer or to reject all offers.  The Government will not award a contract to an Offeror whose proposal contains a deficiency, as defined in FAR 15.0001.  If there is a lower priced conforming offer(s), the Contracting Officer/Source Selection Official must determine that the added value of more expensive proposal (within the cost limitation) would justify award to that offeror.  As part of the evaluation, the Government will evaluate betterments in proposals relative to the minimum standards of the RFP to determine if they offer additional value to the Government.      
      
	Organization and Technical Approach Ratings and Definitions: 

Excellent	Proposal demonstrates excellent understanding of the requirements and approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards.  Proposal has exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Agency.  Very good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting government requirements.  

Good	Proposal demonstrates a good understanding of requirements and approach that exceeds performance or capability standards.  Proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the Agency.  Good probability of success with overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the agency’s requirements.  

Satisfactory	Proposal meets most of the solicitation requirements and demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements. Advantages were offset by disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications given by offeror were acceptable.  Fair probability of success with overall moderate degree of risk in meeting the Agency’s requirements.

Marginal	Proposal demonstrates shallow understanding of requirements and approach that only marginally meets performance or capability standards necessary for minimal, but acceptable contract performance. Proposal would require major rewrites to make it acceptable. Probability of success is questionable without discussions with the offeror.     

Unsatisfactory	Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations; there is an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Agency’s requirements. Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies and these conditions cannot be corrected without a major rewrite or resubmission.  Unacceptable risk, not awardable as proposed

 

             Relative Past Performance Confidence Ratings:   The following ratings and related definitions will be used to define the performance risk:

Very High Degree of Confidence	Performance met all contract requirements and exceeded many to the Government's benefit.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very high degree of confidence the contractor will meet or exceed the Government's requirements.  

High Confidence	Performance met contract requirements. Good quality. Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective action to resolve where appropriate. Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant. Good probability of success with overall high degree of confidence in meeting the government's requirements.

Average Confidence	Performance met most contract requirements. Adequate quality. Problems were identified however; contractor usually took adequate corrective action. Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  OR Although performance generally exceeds expectations and was generally rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation. Fair probability of success with an average degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government's requirements.

Below Average Confidence	Performance met some contract requirements. Fair quality. Problems were identified however; contractor sometimes took corrective action, but not always to the owner’s satisfaction. Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant. Probability of success is unclear with an overall below average degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government's requirements. 

Low Degree of Confidence	Performance did not meet some contractual requirements. There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature. Contractor's corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective. Performance was current and generally relevant to semi- relevant. Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably low degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government’s requirements.  

Neutral	No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction. A search was unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel. This is neither a negative or positive assessment.

(i) Means any item of supply that is—
(A) A commercial item;

(9) “Required form” means in the form of mill product, such as bar, billet, wire, slab, plate or sheet, and in the grade appropriate for the production of—
(i) A finished end item delivered to the Department of Defense; or
(ii) A finished component assembled into an end item delivered to the Department of Defense.
(10) “Specialty metal” means—

(A) Specialty metals contained in a COTS item that was accepted without modification by the next higher tier are excepted and remain excepted even if a piece of the COTS item subsequently is removed (e.g., the end is removed from a COTS screw or an extra hole is drilled in a COTS bracket).
(B) For specialty metals that were not contained in a COTS item upon acceptance, but are added to the COTS item after acceptance, the added specialty metals are subject to the restrictions (e.g., a special reinforced handle made of specialty metal that is added to a COTS item).
(C) If two or more COTS items are combined in such a way that the resultant item is not a COTS item, only the specialty metals involved in joining the COTS items together are subject to the restrictions (e.g., a COTS aircraft is outfitted with a COTS engine, but not a COTS engine normally provided with that aircraft.)
(D) For COTS items that are normally sold in the commercial marketplace with various options, items that include such options are also COTS items. However, if a COTS item is offered to the Government with an option that is not normally offered in the commercial marketplace, that option is subject to the specialty metals restrictions. (e.g., An aircraft is normally sold to the public with an option for several different radios. DoD requests a military-unique radio. The aircraft is still a COTS item, but the military-unique radio is not a COTS item, and must comply with the specialty metals restrictions, unless another excerption applies.)

(i) A satisfactory quality;
(ii) A sufficient quantity; and
(iii) The required form.
(6) Specialty metals, other than specialty metals in high performance magnets, that do not meet any of the exceptions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this clause, if the total weight of such noncompliant metals does not exceed 2 percent of the total weight of specialty metals in the item, as estimated in good faith by the Contractor.

(c) (1) Streamlined compliance for commercial derivative military articles. As an alternative to the compliance required in paragraph (b) of this clause, the Contractor may purchase an amount of domestically melted specialty metals in the required form, for use during the period of contract performance in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article, In the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause if—
(i) This is an acquisition of commercial derivative military articles; and
(ii) The Contractor has certified in its offer in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause.
(2) Certification for streamlined compliance for commercial derivative military articles (to be submitted with offer when applicable). The offeror [  ] certifies  [  ] does not certify that prior to award it will have entered into a contractual agreement or agreements to purchase an amount of domestically melted or produced specialty metal in the required form for use during the period of contract performance in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article, that is not less than the Contractor’s good faith estimate of the greater of—
(i) An amount equivalent to 120% of the amount of specialty metal that is required to carry out the production of the commercial derivative military article (including the work performed under each subcontract); or
(ii) An amount equivalent to 50% of the amount of specialty metal that is purchased by the contractor and its subcontractors for use during such period in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article.
(3) For the purposes of the certification in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the amount of specialty metal that is required to carry out the production of the commercial derivative military article includes specialty metal contained in any item, including commercially available off-the-shelf items, incorporated into such commercial derivative military article.

(d) Unless the Contractor has certified in accordance with paragraph (c), the Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, excluding paragraph (c) but including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts for articles containing specialty metals.

(5) Computing penalty amount. The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.
(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the  7th  day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivers the supplies or performs the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.

Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.

Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.

Registered in the CCR database means that--

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record “Active”.

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation “DUNS” or “DUNS +4” followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--

(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or

(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:

(i) Company legal business.

(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.

(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.

(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).

(v) Company Telephone Number.

(vi) Date the company was started.

(vii) Number of employees at your location.

(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.

(ix) Line of business (industry).

(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).

(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

The time stated for completion shall include final cleanup of the premises. 
(End of clause)

52.211-13     TIME EXTENSIONS (SEP 2000)

Time extensions for contract changes will depend upon the extent, if any, by which the changes cause delay in the completion of the various elements of construction. The change order granting the time extension may provide that the contract completion date will be extended only for those specific elements related to the changed work and that the remaining contract completion dates for all other portions of the work will not be altered. The change order also may provide an equitable readjustment of liquidated damages under the new completion schedule.

52.232-33  PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER—CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)

(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term “EFT” refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.

(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--

(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or

(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).

(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.

(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.

(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 

(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--

(i) Making a correct payment;

(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and

(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.

(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--

(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or

(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.

(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.

(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.

(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.

(End of clause)

52.236-4     PHYSICAL DATA (APR 1984)

Data and information furnished or referred to below is for the Contractor's information.  The Government shall not be responsible for any interpretation of or conclusion drawn from the data or information by the Contractor.

Whenever the Contracting Officer becomes aware of any noncompliance with these requirements or any condition which poses a serious or imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or Government personnel, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor orally, with written confirmation, and request immediate initiation of corrective action.  This notice, when delivered to the Contractor or the Contractor's representative at the work site, shall be deemed sufficient notice of the noncompliance and that corrective action is required.  After receiving the notice, the Contractor shall immediately take corrective action.  If the Contractor fails or refuses to promptly take corrective action, the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping all or part of the work until satisfactory corrective action has been taken.  The Contractor shall not be entitled to any equitable adjustment of the contract price or extension of the performance schedule on any stop work order issued under this clause.

(e)  The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (e), with appropriate changes in the designation of the parties, in subcontracts.

(f)  Before commencing the work, the Contractor shall-

		J.4. Offeror may, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, be asked to provide clarifications regarding their proposals.  The offeror shall be held responsible for the validity of all information supplied in their proposal.  Should subsequent investigation disclose that the facts and conditions were not as stated, the proposal may be rejected or contract terminated for default after the contract award.

	J.5. Each proposal shall give the complete mailing address of the contractor and be signed by an authorized representative by original signature with his or her name and legal title typed below the signature line.  If the contract’s contact will be a different entity, indicate that individual’s contact information for communication purposes.  Each proposal shall include the contractor's tax number.

	J.6. A contractor may modify a proposal by letter or by FAX transmission at any time prior to the closing date and time for receipt of proposals. 

	J.7. A proposal may be withdrawn on written request from the vendor to the Point-of-Contact at the Division of Facilities Management prior to the closing date.

              J.8  Any explanation desired by an offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of the solicitation must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for a reply to reach offerors before the submission of their offer.  All questions and requests for information (RFI) must be received NOT LATER THAN ten (10) calendar days prior to closing date of the solicitation.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to address questions received after this time following solicitation closing with those offerors in the competitive range should one be established.  Any interpretations made will be in the form of an amendment of the solicitation and will be furnished to all prospective offerors via posting to www.fbo.gov .  Receipt of an amendment by the offeror must be acknowledged in the space provided on the SF 33, or by returning a signed copy of the amendment by the time set for receipt of proposals.  Explanations or instructions given in a form other than an amendment to the solicitation shall not be binding.  Any questions or requests for clarifications, and information concerning this solicitation must be submitted in writing by email, to the contracting specialist at robert.parvin@us.army.mil. 
.
	J.9. The right is reserved, as the interest of the Government may require, to revise or amend, the solicitation, specifications prior to and/or after the date set for receipt of proposals, as necessary.  Such changes, if any, will be announced by an amendment or amendments to this Request for Proposal.  All information relating to this RFP, including pertinent changes/amendments and other information applicable prior to the date set for receipt of proposals will be posted on the following website: www.fbo.gov.   Though every effort will be made to provide email notification when a change is posted, such notification is NOT guaranteed and should not be expected.   Offerors are strongly cautioned to check this site frequently and to “refresh” their web page to ensure they have the latest information.  

	J.10.   If the offeror takes exception to any of the requirements specified in this solicitation, the offeror shall clearly identify each such exception and include a complete explanation of why the exception was taken and what benefit accrues to the Government.  All exceptions to the solicitation requirements and supporting rationale shall be included in an addendum to the proposal and clearly labeled "Exceptions".  An addendum is only required if the offeror takes exception to any requirement in the solicitation.  (The Addendum does not have a page limitation, but shall only include information relevant to exceptions taken to the solicitation requirements.)  The Government will assume an offeror takes no exceptions to any solicitation requirement if the offeror does not submit an Addendum identifying exceptions.  Offerors are advised that solicitation requirements are not necessarily negotiable and such exceptions may render an offeror's proposal unacceptable and ineligible for award.  

	J.11. There are three factors that will be evaluated by the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) and with exception of Price, they will be rated at the factor level.  The evaluation shall be based on the following factors: (1) Relevant Experience and Past Performance (2) Organization and Technical Approach and (3) Price (within the stipulated price limitation).  Evaluated within the factor Organization and Technical Approach include two sub factors (1) Demonstrated compliance with the requirements of the SOW and (2) Demonstrated understanding the requirements of the facility addition/enclosure.  Relevant Past Performance and Organization and Technical Approach is approximately equal in value and when combined is more important than price, provided the price is within the stipulated price limitation.   Adjective evaluation ratings will be provided for Past Performance and Technical Approach.    Proposal Submission Format:

				J.15. Completed Performance Questionnaire shall be returned to: 

		Contracting Officer
		Attn: CPT Robert M. Parvin
		2737 S. Kansas Ave.
		Topeka, KS 66611-1170

These should arrive not later than the closing date for receipt of proposal shown on the SF 33.  Reference packages may e-mailed to: robert.parvin@us.army.mil faxed to (785)274-1624. Questionnaires must be submitted by the client/evaluator directly to the Contracting Officer.

	J.16. Offerors lacking relevant present/past performance experience may submit information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement if such information is relevant to this acquisition. Such information shall, as a minimum, include: (1) Name(s) of Predecessor Company/Subcontractor and/or Key Personnel; (2) Complete Address: (3) Telephone, Fax Number and email address; (4) Brief synopsis of the experience (a resume may be submitted for "Key Personnel") (5) Describe in detail relevancy to this project.   Note that use of subcontractors or key personnel to obtain relevant past performance shall commit the offeror to use the proposed personnel/subcontractors in the performance of the contract. 

 	J.17 Evaluation: Relative Experience and Past Performance:  The SSEB shall evaluate relative Past Performance by considering such factors as similarity of test cell, an offeror's business practices, customer relationship, offerors ability to successfully perform on prior relevant contracts.  The SSEB will consider in their evaluation recent and relevant past performance and responses to prior client’s questionnaires.  Current, Relevant, Trends:  Evaluators will consider the current, relevant and trends of the performance information while conducting its performance evaluation.  Current is performance occurring within the past five (5) years prior to the solicitation release date.  Within this period, performance occurring later in the period may have greater significance than work occurring earlier in the period.

	J.18. Based on the evaluation results, the proposal will be assigned one of five (5) confidence ratings.  The ratings and related definitions that will be used to define the confidence the Government has in the offeror’s ability to successfully perform the contract work.

	J.19. An offeror with no Past Performance may receive a rating based on the evaluation of its predecessor companies, key personnel, and/or subcontractors. These ratings may not have the same weight as the ratings of the proposing company.   If such information is not applicable (i.e., the offeror does not have a predecessor company, key personnel or subcontractors with relevant experience), the offeror shall be evaluated as "neutral”. However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant Past Performance history, while rated ”Neutral” in Past Performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offerors. 

	J.20. In evaluating performance confidence, the Government may contact your references for additional information and to assure validity of the received questionnaires. The Government may contact sources other than those provided by the offeror for information with respect to past performance. These other sources may include, but are not limited to telephone interviews, and Government personnel with personal knowledge of the offeror’s performance capability.  The Government reserves the rights to obtain and evaluate past performance information from any source it deems appropriate.

	J.21. In accordance with FAR 15.106(a)(2), if award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposals, e.g., the relevance of an offeror's past performance information or to resolve minor clerical errors. Offerors shall be provided an opportunity to address any negative past performance information about which the Offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. 
Thursday, January 31, 2008

	J.22. Organization and Technical Approach.  This information considers the offeror’s proposed technical approach to executing compliance with the Statement of Work.. 

	J.23.	Organization:  Describe what firms, their resources and how their resources will be utilized, their roles and responsibilities and any contractual arrangements that have been established. 
	
	J.24. Describe the technical approach to designing and constructing the turn key test cell Dyno in support of the X1100 Transmission and other previously mentioned transmissions.  Address each element defined in the Statement of Work and how you propose to address and satisfy the Dyno performance requirements.  Provide a preliminary schedule indicating a time line from date of award until completion of final Dyno training. Describe your warranty and list any specific exclusion from the warranty, if applicable.   

		J.25. Describe your quality control approach, corporate systems and capabilities to maintain quality control of the project.  Describe the proposed quality control organization, including the proposed staffing plan.  The Government is interested in demonstrable capabilities to assure quality control and how the offeror will maintain quality control throughout the project.
	
	J.26.  The Contractor shall identify in their proposal a Project Manager who will function as the single point of contact between the Contractor and Government.  The proposal must contain a resume of experience this individual has in the supervising and oversight of the Dyno design, manufacture and installation process. The Contractor’s Project Manager shall be responsible to develop and furnish to the Government within 45 days from date of contract award a detailed project schedule that will enable the tracking of progress and action item status.  The proposal shall include a preliminary schedule showing critical milestones in the design, manufacture, and installation and testing of the provided test cell. 

		 
	J.27. Evaluation: Organization and Technical Approach -- The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and any deficiencies in the offeror’s proposal and understanding of the Dyno technical and functional requirements.  The evaluation will include the offeror’s capability to execute the project. Some additional specific evaluation considerations are listed below.  However, this list is not all-inclusive. 

	J.28. Organization:  The SSEB will evaluate the clarity and strength of the overall technical approach and how well the proposal defines the process they will utilize to execute the entire scope of work.  
	
	J.29. Processes during Design and Construction:  The SSEB will evaluation the realism of the preliminary schedule showing the critical milestones in the design, manufacture, installation and training proposed for the test cell.  The evaluation will include the prior experience of the Project Manager in delivery of similar Dyno projects.   
	
	J.30. The SSEB will evaluate the offeror technical approach to designing and constructing the turn key Dyno test cell.  They will evaluate the proposal as to how each element of the Statement of Work was addressed in the proposal indicating understanding of the requirement and how they intended to satisfy the overall Dyno performance requirements.  The SSEB will evaluate the offeror’s warranty and specific exclusions in the one-year warranty.   

	J.31. The SSEB will evaluate the offeror’s quality control approach, corporate systems and capabilities to maintain quality control of the project.  They will evaluate the offeror’s quality control organization, including the proposed staffing plan and how the offeror will maintain quality control throughout the project.

	J.32. Oral Presentation:  Upon receipt of all written proposals the SSEB shall schedule and interview all offerors determined to be within the competitive range. Oral presentation will not be scored or evaluated separately.   Oral presentations will normally be followed by a SSEB question and answer period for clarification purposes. The location for presentations will be provided with the presentation date and time assignment.  The purpose of the oral presentations is to provide the offeror with the opportunity to briefly explain any specific documentation provided, to highlight the special features of their proposal, and to identify the benefits of the offeror’s technical data proposal.  Any betterments or deviations that the offeror wishes the Government to consider should be discussed in detail in the oral presentation. The offeror is expected to highlight significant technical points contained in their proposal but will not be permitted to submit anything new, but may expand on anything contained in the proposal. Offerors are cautioned that all information provided, regardless of the format, i.e. written proposal, oral presentation, shall be considered as proposal information, and used in the evaluation process.

 
Section K - Evaluation Factors for Award

(See Section L for proposal submission and evaluation of selection factor) 
              K.1 Basis of Award:  The award shall be based on the evaluation of three factors: (1) Relevant Past Performance (2) Organization and Technical Approach and (3) Price (within the stipulated price limitation).  Evaluated within the factor Organization and Technical Approach include two sub factors (1) Demonstrated compliance with the SOW and (2) Demonstrated understanding the requirements of the facility addition/enclosure.  Relevant Past Performance and Organization and Technical Approach is approximately equal in value and when combined is more important than price, provided the price is within the stipulated price limitation.   Adjective evaluation ratings (shown below) will be provided for Relative Past Performance and Organization and Technical Approach.    
	      K.2. Price:   The purpose of the price/cost evaluation is to determine whether an offeror’s proposed prices/costs for the project are reasonable and realistic in relation to the solicitation requirements and demonstrates an offerors understanding of the proposal requirements.  Price is not separately rated.

	a. The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine whether or not each proposal complies with the stated criteria: "Reasonableness" and Realism". In determining overall cost to the Government for evaluation and selection purposes, the price proposed by an offeror who provides benefits/betterments within the stipulated price limitation may be afforded greater consideration than on offeror who proposes a lower price for basic requirements. 

	b. Price evaluation will consider reasonableness and realistic prices associated with the offeror’s overall technical proposal solution.  Those proposals evaluated as not satisfying all of the price/cost criteria may be eliminated from further consideration unless the Contracting Officer determines:  A minor clerical error has occurred, then the offeror may be given an opportunity to correct the minor error within the constraints of the "clarifications" process or the Contracting Officer determines discussions are required.  Reasonableness of an offeror's proposal is evaluated through price analysis techniques as described in FAR Subpart 15.305(a)(1) and (4).  

	c. For the price to be reasonable, it must represent a price that provides value to the Government when consideration is given to prices in the market, technical and functional capabilities of the offeror. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.  For price to be realistic, it must reflect what it would cost the offeror to perform the effort if the offeror operates with reasonable economy and efficiency. 

	d. Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly explained in the price proposal.  For example, if unique and innovative approaches or conditions are the basis for an unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented.  The burden of proof of price realism rests solely with the offeror.

	K.3. The Contracting Officer will award a firm fixed price contract to that responsible Offeror whose proposal the Source Selection Authority has determined conforms to the solicitation, is fair and reasonable, and the offers the best overall value to the Government, considering all non-priced factors described herein, and price. All evaluation factors, other than price, when combined are considered approximately equal to price, however the contract award price shall not exceed $1,570,000.00.   The intent of this solicitation is to obtain the best proposal within the cost limitation. There is no obligation to approach or match the cost limitation in the offer.  After the Government individually evaluates and rates each proposal, the Contracting Officer/Source Selection Authority will compare the RFP requirements to determine which proposal represents the best value.  The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer or to reject all offers.  The Government will not award a contract to an Offeror whose proposal contains a deficiency, as defined in FAR 15.0001.  If there is a lower priced conforming offer(s), the Contracting Officer/Source Selection Official must determine that the added value of more expensive proposal (within the cost limitation) would justify award to that offeror.  As part of the evaluation, the Government will evaluate betterments in proposals relative to the minimum standards of the RFP to determine if they offer additional value to the Government.      
      
	Organization and Technical Approach Ratings and Definitions: 

Excellent	Proposal demonstrates excellent understanding of the requirements and approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards.  Proposal has exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Agency.  Very good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting government requirements.  

Good	Proposal demonstrates a good understanding of requirements and approach that exceeds performance or capability standards.  Proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the Agency.  Good probability of success with overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the agency’s requirements.  

Satisfactory	Proposal meets most of the solicitation requirements and demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements. Advantages were offset by disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications given by offeror were acceptable.  Fair probability of success with overall moderate degree of risk in meeting the Agency’s requirements.

Marginal	Proposal demonstrates shallow understanding of requirements and approach that only marginally meets performance or capability standards necessary for minimal, but acceptable contract performance. Proposal would require major rewrites to make it acceptable. Probability of success is questionable without discussions with the offeror.     

Unsatisfactory	Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations; there is an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Agency’s requirements. Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies and these conditions cannot be corrected without a major rewrite or resubmission.  Unacceptable risk, not awardable as proposed

 

             Relative Past Performance Confidence Ratings:   The following ratings and related definitions will be used to define the performance risk:

Very High Degree of Confidence	Performance met all contract requirements and exceeded many to the Government's benefit.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very high degree of confidence the contractor will meet or exceed the Government's requirements.  

High Confidence	Performance met contract requirements. Good quality. Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective action to resolve where appropriate. Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant. Good probability of success with overall high degree of confidence in meeting the government's requirements.

Average Confidence	Performance met most contract requirements. Adequate quality. Problems were identified however; contractor usually took adequate corrective action. Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  OR Although performance generally exceeds expectations and was generally rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation. Fair probability of success with an average degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government's requirements.

Below Average Confidence	Performance met some contract requirements. Fair quality. Problems were identified however; contractor sometimes took corrective action, but not always to the owner’s satisfaction. Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant. Probability of success is unclear with an overall below average degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government's requirements. 

Low Degree of Confidence	Performance did not meet some contractual requirements. There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature. Contractor's corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective. Performance was current and generally relevant to semi- relevant. Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably low degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government’s requirements.  

Neutral	No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction. A search was unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel. This is neither a negative or positive assessment. Unknown

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT ACTION- This is a sources sought synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposals. The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center (NIH CC) Pharmacy Department is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey.
<p>The NIH CC Pharmacy Department is seeking a dispensing system for outpatient/take-home medications for a pharmacy within a research hospital that fills approximately 400 prescriptions per day. The dispensing system needs to consist of an information system including workflow management features, a dispensing robot, and devices to support dispensing medications not filled by the robot. The system must be able to be interfaced to Eclipsys' Sunrise Acute Care 5.0 (SAC) to allow medication orders entered in SAC to transfer to the outpatient system. The system must be able to handle entry of medications (e.g. investigational medications) not contained in the usual drug databases. The system needs to produce container labels, auxiliary labels, and patient information sheets. The dispensing robot should label the vials. The system should allow medication refill requests to occur via interactive voice response or web-based technology. The system should also be also to record dispensing medications when picked up by the patient.</p>
<p>The contractor(s) providing the services must have the requisite experience in installing pharmacy information systems and outpatient dispensing robots. They should have installed pharmacy information systems in at least five and dispensing robots in at least ten facilities. The contractor(s) must have experience developing interfaces from prescriber order entry systems to their information system. The contractor must also be able to provide system support on a 24/7 basis. <br /><br />The vendor responses must demonstrate their expertise in ALL of the following items. Please note that failure to specifically demonstrate capability to provide the required services in your response to this market survey may affect the Government's review of industry's ability to perform these services. The vendor's response shall be in sufficient detail to allow the Government to assess the capability of your firm. The vendor response must specifically address each of the following areas:</p>
<p>1) Experience: The capability statement shall show that the vendor has sufficient relevant experience to do the work. The contractor(s) will list the institutions where their system is installed, how long it has been installed, and the <br />number of prescriptions filled per day at that institution.

The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website.

<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12.

<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>

<RESPDATE>073009
<CONTACT>Stephanie Garnett, Contracting Officer, Phone 808-535-3473, Email Stephanie.M.Garnett@uscg.mil
<DESC>The United States Coast Guard identified a requirement for a contractor to provide all labor, materials, equipment, supervision, and other items and services necessary to unearth seven Excavation Areas and two surface areas, and transport and dispose of PCB-contaminated soil and PCB electrical components encountered during the excavation process.  

The Contractor shall also conduct a geophysical investigation at an adjacent site and excavate suspected electrical components, sample the surrounding soil, and transport and dispose of PCB-contaminated soil and electrical components in a United States facility that is licensed, permitted or otherwise approved by the US EPA and state regulatory agencies to accept the waste.  The clean-up standard (i.e., the action level) for PCBs is 10 parts per million.  The project also entails preparing work plans and related documents required to implement this remedial action, and to prepare a Remediation Verification Report (RVR) that summarizes all field activities conducted.  

The Government will be looking for the Contractor’s Past Performance, Qualifications of Key Personnel, and Technical Approach to demonstrate an understanding of the problem. 

On-site Construction is targeted for January 2010 through May 2010.  All close-out submittals to include manifests from landfills must be received and accepted by 1 September 2010.  The Government Estimate is between $1 and $5 million.  A contract will be awarded to the contractor that provides the best value to the Government.  

This procurement is no longer unrestricted as interest from more than two small businesses has been expressed.  This procurement has subsequently been set aside for small businesses.  

The solicitation document will be available at www.fbo.gov approximately 1 July 2009.
To receive further information, please contact Contracting Officer Stephanie Garnett at Stephanie.M.Garnett@uscg.mil.  

The NAICS code for this procurement is 562910 with a size standard of 500 employees.

Breakers for new computer room A/C units (CR-1, CR-2, CR-3 and CR-4) are to be shunt trip, each wired to the existing E-Stop in the corresponding room in which they are located.2.	On New Computer Room A/C Plan, location of new unit CR-4 is changed.  The new location will be in the same general location as the existing unit ECR-4.Also:3.	Add additional phasing note for Phase 1 as follows:G. Existing glycol cooler EGC2 and existing A/C unit ECR2 are to remain on site and be kept in good condition for possible use by the VA as spare parts until Phase 1 work is complete.

<DESC>Contract modification for the below was awarded on October 15, 2009. 

RECOVERY—THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.  THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ08UA00020.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.

This opportunity was available only to Dynamic Educational Systems, Inc. under contract number DOLJ08UA00020.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps has awarded a modification in the amount of $15,389 to the Montgomery Job Corps Centers, operated by Dynamic Educational Systems, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceilings for this contract.

It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).

The funding is intended to address the following program areas:  1) Career Technical Training Educational Services curriculum; 2) Equipment for the CTT Education Services; and 3) Career Technical Skills Training pertaining to the development of green training elements/modules in each of the priority areas (Automotive, Green and Construction Technology) of center-operated programs as detailed in Job Corps Curriculum Change Notice 09-01 and Curriculum Change Notice 09-02.  The operator of the Montgomery center will utilize these funds to make available additional Career Technical Skills Training opportunities to the students of the Montgomery Job Corps Center.  The operator of the Montgomery Job Corps Center will not procure the services through subcontracting opportunities.

<DESC>Security/Location/Amenities/Technology Requirements:  The RRB can accomodate meeting rooms starting at 500 square feet to 11,476 square feet to accomodate 1,000 to 1,500 participants at any given time.

The complex's security, staffing and vendors already possess some form of Government security clearances that should be easily cleared by the White House Liaison Staff.  

Facility accesses must be controlled to ensure the APEC executive meetings are not interrupted.  Security will control access to the surrounding areas, meeting rooms, and all separate entryways.  A dedicated entrance for APEC participants will be established.  

Due to the estimated 1,500 participants for APEC 2011, the requirement for security is the top priority.  The venue will have a professional security staff with a ratio of 1 guard for every 20 participants.  

Restricted access to parking in addition to a holding area for shuttle buses, taxis, etc. is a must for APEC delegates and staff on site; facility parking is available for up to 300 spaces at a reduced cost to the State Department.  

The venue must have a high volume media center to be made available to domestic and international media outlets.  Translator support capability is also crucial considering  the multiple parties involved.

<AWARDEE>International SOS Assistance, Inc., 3600 Horizon Boulevard, Suite 300, Trevose, PA 19053 US
<DESC>The Department of Defense awarded a contract to International SOS Assistance, Inc. of Trevose, Pennsylvania to provide health care support services, dental care services and claims processing for the TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP) in locations outside the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. The Contractor will assist the Chief, TRICARE Overseas Program Branch, TRICARE Area Office (TAO) Directors, and Military Treatment Facility (MTF) commanders in operating an integrated health care delivery system which effectively combines the resources of the military's direct medical care system with the Contractor's health care support services. The contract includes services for active duty family members enrolled in TRICARE Prime who require emergency health care services while traveling overseas. The contract also calls for the establishment of host nation provider networks around military treatment facilities. The contract offers Prime-like programs in both MTF and remote locations to active duty service members and their command-sponsored family members, including National Guard and Reserve members on orders for more than 30 days. The type of contract is Fixed Price Award Fee. The performance period includes a base year (1 November 2009 through 31 August 2010) and five one-year option periods. The base year award was executed at $16,900,988.00. The total estimated value of the contract, if all option periods are exercised, is $269,052,427. Services will begin on 1 September 2010. This requirement was competitively procured. Source selection procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation were used to determine the successful offeror.

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition
<p>1. Requiring Agency: Department of Commerce<br />National Technical Information Service (NTIS)<br />Alexandria, Virginia 22312</p>
<p>Contracting Agency: Acquisition Management Division<br />National Institute of Standards and Technology<br />100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640<br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved: <br />The action being approved is a follow-on award of a Firm Fixed Price sole source contract to Media Services Group, Ltd. (MSGL) for the upgrade of Cispub, the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) enterprise resource planning (ERP) order processing system. <br />In 1992, Cispub was chosen as the ERP for NTIS. Cispub is the core of the NTIS product and services ordering process and includes functions such as financial management, inventory management, order management, manufacturing management, and subscriptions management. NTIS created a team of subject matter experts (SMEs) to evaluate the known requirements and create a functional requirements document. The current version of Cispub, now called &Eacute;lan is a significant functional with a more robust warehouse management component. Such an upgrade would provide the real-time inventory management and reporting required by Education and the NTIS program managers as well as meets the specific requirement to upgrade the NTIS OPS.<br />NTIS existing data is in the current version of Cispub and its Unidata database making the Cispub/Elan upgrade unique to NTIS. The Unidata database is not a standard database and consequently to convert existing Cispub data into a non-Unidata system would require hundreds of hours to accurately extract, model, and ingest.<br />As confirmed by the Contracting Officer, Media Services Group, Ltd. is the sole developer, sales channel and support provider for our products. The &Eacute;lan upgrade for CISPUB (in use by NTIS) is provided only from Media Services Group, Ltd. through direct sales. There are no other commercially available upgrades to Cispub from other sources.<br />NTIS has become an increasingly digital production environment. No longer can NTIS rely on their version of the product since that version has older technology that is not accessible to current Internet queries, is less secure, and generally no longer supportable by MSGL. To meet its congressionally mandated mission, NTIS must make information available to the public on a cost recovery basis. By upgrading to the latest version of the OPS, NTIS will be able to meet its mission and remain within cost parameters.</p>
<p>3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs, including the estimated value, inclusive of any option periods.<br />The deliverable for this project is an upgrade to the NTIS Order Processing System (OPS) currently version 7.n to the latest version, now called Elan. The upgrade will be completed in phases to enable NTIS to mitigate technical and human relations (HR) issues. NTIS will initially deploy a limited function set with limited licensing to ensure a controlled implementation. The system will be delivered with planning, training and deployment services in addition to licensing and operations &amp; maintenance (O&amp;M) support.<br />MSGL will deliver services, software and licensing to support the phased deployment. The first phase will emphasize basic Elan Book operations focusing on (1) warehouse operations, (2) inventory management, (3) customer relationship management, and basic e-Commerce order processing for 20 sessions. MSGL and NTIS will jointly plan the deployment including data analysis and upgrade of current NTIS data and functionality into the Elan environment.<br />The estimated value of this requirement for the Base Year and all Options is $619,000 with a period of performance of September 1 2009 through 30 September 30 2010 with a single one-year option for implementation services.<br />4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:<br />41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) allows for contracting without providing for full and open competition in circumstances where services are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br />Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling NTIS requirements<br />5. Describe how the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:<br />This is a software system upgrade of commercially available software that is only sold by Media Services Group, LTD and is not available from any other source. MSGL sells, assists with the deployment and offers operations and maintenance of the software.<br />6.A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FEDBIZOPPS notice was or will be publicized as required, and if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies:<br />A notice of intent to negotiate and award a sole source contract with Media Services Group, Ltd was posted on FedBizOpps on August 19, 2009. No sources responded to that notice.</p>
<p><br />7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:<br />The anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable. The Contracting Officer will price analysis, comparison to commercial list prices for the upgrade and if appropriate other analysis techniques.<br />8. A description of the market survey conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:<br />The Government's needs can be met only by MSGL. The market research included finding if MSGL sold the upgrade through any other party or vendor-they do not. The OPS &Eacute;lan upgrade from Cispub is commercially available but only from MSGL. Consequently, a full market research study called for in FAR Part 10 was not required and was not completed.<br />9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:<br />The current version of the OPS requires a hardware system and software operating system (OS) that will no longer be supportable in the near future. The security of the system will be at risk without vendor support. The operation of the system relies on vendor support and once the vendors stop maintaining spare and replacement components, the entire OPS is at risk and consequently the operation of NTIS.<br />The decision to upgrade included the following analysis: <br />&bull; The NTIS staff will require far less re-training and be able to utilize more of their current technical skills with an OPS upgrade vice new system,<br />&bull; The services to upgrade are delivered from MSGL who understands both the current and the upgrade systems (many of original Cispub staff who implemented current version are still with MSGL)<br />&bull; Time to implement an upgrade is shorter than any comparable option<br />&bull; The OPS &Eacute;lan upgrade provides a path to serve the long term needs of NTIS while at the same time providing an immediate bridge solution to support the new NTIS needs for a rapid migration to an integrated order processing, accounting and warehouse management system, operating as a single solution for high turn products.<br />&bull; An &Eacute;lan upgrade offers a highly scalable, secure platform solution to fit the current, broader set of needs of NTIS.<br />o Example of broader needs is the combined book and subscriptions requirements where a journal or subscription changes its frequency of issue, &Eacute;lan supports the change in earned and deferred income without any operator manipulation. <br />o Current OPS resides on a secure, industry standard hardware/OS platform. The &Eacute;lan system is supported by Microsoft SQL Server providing an open platform data base with a lower cost structure compared to other data base products.<br />&bull; As part of the upgrade, the existing IBM Universe environment will be migrated to the current IBM Unidata system, a large savings compared to a new purchase.<br />&bull; An immediate need for a fully integrated Warehouse Management System and Order Processing System can be satisfied by an &Eacute;lan upgrade to &Eacute;lan WMS with &Eacute;lan Book.<br />&bull; The &Eacute;lan upgrade from CISPUB is delivered at a lower lifecycle cost than a new replacement solution.</p>
<p>Certification that any supporting data which forms a basis for the justification (e.g., Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements) have been verified to be complete and accurate by the customer.<br />I, Keith Sinner, NTIS CIO, certify that the supporting data for the upgrade to the NTIS OPS form an adequate basis for this justification.<br />________________________________ _____________<br />Keith Sinner, NTIS CIO Date<br />10. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:<br />No other sources have expressed interest as a prime contractor in this acquisition.<br />11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:<br />NTIS is not aware of any barriers regarding this procurement<br />12. Contracting Officer Certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief:<br />I, Michael Scheuchenzuber, Contracting Officer, certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
