The use of a bran name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/ITI/DSS has identified the Network Appliance products as akey component of DSS's file storage management on OpenNet and ClassNet. The Network Appliance systems currently provide storage for over 1400 OpenNet users. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet DSS's requirements for file storage as a key component of the Department's cohesive network infrastructure.<BR><BR>
