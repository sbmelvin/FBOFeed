Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer, Ms. Terry Clark (316-759-4525) for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Group, Denver, Colorado, intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501 with Glowball Solutions, 10720 Eliot Circle, Ste 102, Westminster, CO 80234-2799.
Description of the supplies or services: The Research and Development (R&D) Office is upgrading the Proposal and Performance Contract Management System (PropC), a Web-based application that automates many of the business practices of the Science and Technology (S&T) Program.  PropC is an important tool used by the R&D Office for the Science and Technology Program, a Reclamation-wide competitive, merit-based applied R&D program that is focused on innovative solutions for Reclamation water and facility managers, and our western water stakeholders. The program has contributed many of the tools and capabilities in use today by Reclamation and western water managers.  PropC automates research proposal submission, review, funding, and progress tracking and provides management tools in the form of detailed, dynamic reports and the ability to track changes to ongoing research.  There are only two employees in the R&D Office working on the S&T Program, and PropC allows them to manage hundreds of research projects that would otherwise require more employees. Today, PropC Version 7 is only about 60 percent complete and all development to date has been performed by Glowball Solutions. 
The R&D Office has spent significant time and effort to describe and educate Glowball Solutions of our business processes and practices. As a result, Glowball Solutions is uniquely qualified to complete these improvements and provide technical support. Failure to award a follow on contract to Glowball Solutions will result in unacceptable delays to the program schedule and result in a substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition. It's estimated the development of the remaining 40% of the PropC system will be delayed 9 to 11 months if a new contractor must be brought up to speed on the R&D Office business processes and practices. Additionally, another contractor would need to spend substantial time to become familiar with the programming code authored to date by Glowball Solutions. The estimated cost of these delays to the government is estimated at $130,000 to $150,000. Glowball Solustions, through their past performance in developing PropC has demonstrated extensive web development experience and extensive Cold Fusion programming experience. Further, PropC through their past performance in developing PropC has garnered extensive knowledge of the Bureau of Reclamation Science and Technology Program business practices and processes. 
Competition is restricted to only one source IAW FAR 13.501. This procurement will be awarded using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, capability statements received by 1200 MST January 15, 2010 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses to this notice shall submitted to Rob Brackett, Contract Specialist via email to rbrackett@usbr.gov

<SUBJECT>Virtual Reality System for the NIOSH Mine Rescue and Escape Training Laboratory
<SOLNBR>2010-N-11870
<CONTACT>Darrin P Barber, Contracting Officer, Phone (412) 386-5239, Email dbarber@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is responsible for conducting acquisitions in support of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).&nbsp; This&nbsp;Presolicitation Notice replaces / continues&nbsp;the requirement identified&nbsp;in a previous Sources Sought notice using number 2010-N-11855.&nbsp;<br /><br />NIOSH plans to create a Mine Rescue and Escape Training Laboratory in Pittsburgh, PA which includes a two-part virtual reality system. One component will be a 360 degree stereoscopic immersive environment appropriate for group training situations and the other will be a large screen display appropriate for 3D visualization and display of 2D content. The trainee audiences are mine rescue team members and the general workforce of underground coal mines in the United States.
<p>This requirement is solicited on a full and open competition - unrestricted basis. One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.</p>
<p>CDC intends to award a single Firm-Fixed-Price contract for this requirement. The requirement is scheduled to be installed and fully operational with 2 training modules at the NIOSH site within 6 months after the award of a contract. The final 2 modules are scheduled to be complete within 9 months after award of a contract.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document and reference material will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov between 15 to 30 calendar days after the posting date of this notice. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of prospective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps Internet site.</p>
<p>Requirement details:</p>
<p>The Government seeks to purchase a turnkey solution which will include procurement and installation of hardware and related software and training on use of the system. The system should be PC and Windows-based. The display components must be capable of projecting dark (underground mine) and light (surface mine) environments and have automated calibration of projectors. Software demonstration of system capabilities must be included. Four training modules for use with the system are also required. The training is to be set in a virtual environment which includes an underground coal mine longwall panel and a development section. NIOSH personnel must be trained in routine system operation and maintenance. Appropriate licenses and IP rights must be provided to NIOSH.</p>
<p>The immersive environment must be large enough for simultaneous training and observation of a full mine rescue team (5 members with equipment) and 3 other individuals playing the role of "victims" during the session. The projection screen must be 360 degrees and tall enough to give the illusion of wrapping overhead of the trainees. The proposed installation site is approximately 43 feet by 46 feet with a height of approximately 18 feet. Suggested screen dimensions are approximately 10 meters (32.8 feet) in diameter by 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) high. The image projected must be seamless. The projection system must allow the display of both 3D and 2D content. Passive stereo with circular polarization is preferred. Methods for interaction with the virtual environment and for capturing participant responses during training are required. Motion tracking capabilities or the potential to add them to the system in the future is desired. Surround sound audio capabilities must be included.</p>
<p>The large display screen will be used for projecting training modules and geological or engineering data sets. It should not rely on head tracking for point of view. The display should have the capability to provide one seamless image. Passive stereo with circular polarization is preferred for standardization between the two display systems. A method for displaying traditional content, such as slides and video, should also be provided. Surround sound audio capabilities must be included. Methods for interaction with the virtual environment and for capturing participant responses during training are required. The proposed installation site is approximately 9.1 meters (29.9 feet) wide with a floor to ceiling height of 3.4 meters (11.2 feet). Maximum screen size within those dimensions is preferred.</p>
<p>Software providing a training environment which includes longwall panel and a development section in a virtual underground coal mine is required. They should be scalable for use with both display systems listed above. Interactive elements and a method for capturing trainee responses are required. Four training modules to be set in the "virtual mine" should be appropriate for use during federally mandated underground coal mine training sessions. Two modules should be simulations similar in content and length to mine rescue problems which are conducted during mine rescue contests. See http://www.msha.gov/MineRescue/PROBLEMS/CONTESTPROBLEMS.htm for example problems. Two modules should be simulations for general miners covering knowledge and skills needed for successful emergency mine evacuations. They should be roughly based on NIOSH developed training scenarios. See Harry's Hard Choices (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/products/product160.htm) for an example. The four modules will be used for research and demonstration purposes by NIOSH staff. Ability for NIOSH researchers to make future modifications to the software and to create new modules is desired.</p>
<p>The following is a likely list of topics (in no particular order) for consideration during evaluation of proposals; [1] Completeness and usability of the overall solution, [2] Technical specifications of hardware and software, [3] Ability to meet Section 508 accessibility requirements for documents, operator controls, and interaction devices, [4] Flexibility of system hardware and software for future maintenance, modifications, and upgrades, [5] Management structure, capabilities, and personnel expertise in the areas of display technologies, creation of virtual environments, simulation-based training design and materials development, underground coal mines, and mine emergency and mine rescue training, [6] Past performance, [7] Fairness and reasonableness of pricing including an estimate of on-going expenses for use of the systems including hardware and software monitoring, maintenance, and license fees.</p>

Intermittent assignments can normally be expected to range in duration from three to six weeks in support of existing revenue projects.

Revenue policy experts should possess experience in the review, analysis and development of revenue and tax policy proposals, in the drafting and review of revenue laws and regulations, and the review and analysis of the economic impact of tax and fiscal policy changes. Certain assignments require candidates to have significant project management experience, to include the ability to prepare project work plans, statements of work and manage human resources. Prior foreign technical assistance work and knowledge of a foreign language are highly desirable, but not required. <em><strong>There is a special interest at this time in individuals with both technical skills and bilingual fluency in Spanish/English, French/English, and Portuguese/English.</strong></em> In addition to technical skills, we are looking for individuals with outstanding communication skills, capable of listening to the client and then providing effective oral and written responses.</p>

Overseas benefits are provided as allowed by federal regulations.</em> Successful applicants will be subject to a background security investigation at the appropriate level and medical clearances. <em>This announcement is open and continuous until June 30, 2010, although selections may be made in advance of that date based on program needs.</em> Applicants should submit a cover letter, resume or OF-612 by e-mail to: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recruitment@ota.treas.gov</span> or by mail to U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Office of Technical Assistance, Attn: Recruitment Coordinator, 740 15th Street, N.W. - 4th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20220.

<DESC>**Correct Solicitation Number is SPM300-09-R-0074

This is a Request for Information (RFI). There is no solicitation available at this time. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. This RFI does not constitute a commitment by the Government. Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released. Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked. Vendor participation is not a promise of future business with the Government. The purpose of this RFI is to conduct Market Research to identify potential avenues / zone specification / identification for supporting the Army and Air Force customers within the Afghanistan Area of Responsibility (AOR). 

Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is an agency of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). DLA provides supply support and logistics services to the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and other federal agencies (customers). The Subsistence Operations, a Directorate of DSCP, is planning to award a Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) five-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract. The estimated solicitation issue is Spring 2010. The intended contract base period is anticipated to be 18 months with one 18 month option, and a final option period of 24 months. It is anticipated that there will be a ramp up period although the actual time for ramp up may be subject to change depending on Market Research findings. DSCP Subsistence Supplier Operations is seeking information with the intent to solicit and award a Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) service platform in Afghanistan. 

The SPV Program has been successfully implemented around the world. There are some Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) SPV open solicitations currently on the street. Interested vendors are encouraged to view active solicitations from other regions by visiting FedBizOps.gov. This will provide prospective offerors some idea of Contract Terms and Conditions, Statement of Work, Contract Administrative Data, Solicitation Provisions, Price Definitions, Rebates and Discounts Language, 832 requirements, Evaluation Criteria/ Past Performance and Reporting Requirements, etc. The SPV is the primary distribution channel (single distributor) for procurement and delivery of a full range of commercial and Government Furnished Material (GFM) food and beverage items in a geographical region. Customers order directly from the Prime Vendor via the Subsistence Total Ordering and Receipt Electronic System (STORES) with a scheduled delivery date (commonly referred to as Required Delivery Date (RDD). Dependent upon the specific customers, deliveries shall average 1-3 times per week to each customer, unless the customer and the prime vendor agree upon more or less frequent stops. The estimated annual dollar value is $780,000,000.00. Please note that the numbers of customers, frequency of ordering and dollar value are estimates and are subject to change. The SPV provides all Subsistence products for which it has been authorized to distribute by DSCP Subsistence (via STORES customer ordering catalogs). Designated contracting instruments include, but are not limited to, Manufacturer Pricing Agreements (MPAs) and National Allowance Pricing Agreements (NAPAs). All commercial items are brand name specific or generic products that are identified by a National Stock Number (NSN) or Local Stock Number (LSN). GFM items are generally ration type items.

The offeror that is awarded the prime vendor contract under this solicitation may become a potential backup supplier for other prime vendors, including but not limited to prime vendors in the:  United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Iraq, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Djibouti, should a Prime Vendor be unable to support (for any reason) customers covered under its contract.  Offerors agreement to perform as a potential back-up is required. 

DSCP is required to have quantitative metrics to evaluate contractor performance. These include, but are not limited to, Contracting Officer Representative (COR) reports, food audit reports, Not in Stock (NIS) reports, Fill Rate, Rejection reports, CPARS and product recalls. One measure currently utilized under current contracts is fill rate. This measure only allows for inclusion of items defined as usage items by the customer. The fill rate metric is calculated by number of cases delivered divided by number of cases ordered. DSCP is seeking ideas, recommendations, and other metrics based on commercial practices used for evaluating contractor performance. 

Your responses are requested by the close of business on January 13, 2009 and may be sent via mail or email. If email is your preferred source of transmission, we recommend that you look for a confirmation within 48 hours of submission by the point of contact provided below. Any responses received after this date may not be reviewed or considered in our contract formation process.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 314110   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR Clause 6.302-1 to Tandus US, LLC, 1735 Cleveland Way, Dalton, GA 30721 to purchase and install  5,310 square yards of Nomad ER3RS 18" Modular Carpet Tile. Twenty onehundred square yards will be used to replace existing Nomad ER3RS modular tile carpet in the Ariel Rios North Building (ARN) and Ronald Reagan Building (RRB) and 3,110 square yards will supplement the Facility Management Division's existing attic stock.    
EPA began using the Nomad ER3RS 18" Modular carpet tile exclusively in the ARN and RRB, which have over 1,610, 993 square feet of space, in 1999 and 2002 respectively.  The Nomad carpet meets environmental standards, i.e., 100% type dyed nylon, pre-applied peel and stick backing adhesive, backing that has a VOC level 20 times less than recommended standards and it is 100% recyclable.  
Tandus discontinued production of the Nomad ER3RS 18" Modular Carpet Tile in December 2004 but continued to make Nomad for EPA.  EPA has maintained attic stock of the Nomad ER3RS 18" Modular carpet tile over the years for office reconfiguration projects and replacing water damaged carpet due to flooding in the buildings. The sole source award for the carpet will maintain the existing aesthetical features of the work environment in these buildings and allow EPA to take advantage of the volume discount offered by Tandus US, LLC.  
The supplies and services to be provided are commercial within the meaning of FAR Clause 52.212.1.  This statutory authority for other than full and open competition is USC 2304 (c) (1). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Companies who can provide the Nomad ER3RS 18" Modular Carpet Tile that meets or exceeds the stated environmental standards must indicate their interest on or before January 15, 2010.  Oral communications are not acceptable.  No quotation/proposal received in response to this notice shall be considered since this synopsis cannot be considered a Request for Quotation/proposal.  All responsible sources will be considered for evaluating the determination to issue a sole source contract.  The purchase order will be issued on or about January 19, 2010 and will be for a period of 12 months.  The NAICS code is 314110, Carpet and Rug Mills.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation is scheduled to be released via FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) in the near future detailing requirements for a service requirement entitled:  Asbestos Abatement at Lower Granite Dam's Unit 3.   This work includes removal and disposal of asbestos-containing materials (ACM) from generator unit 3 at Lower Granite Dam located near Pomeroy, Washington.<BR> <BR>There are two main time periods for performance of this work.  The first period of performance must occur prior to 30 March 2010.  The second period of performance must occur during the 2 July through 30 September 2010 time period.  During the spring months of April, May and June, all turbine units at Lower Granite must remain available for operation to pass water from the spring runoff.   <BR><BR>First performance period:   The Government plans to take the Turbine Unit 3 out of service to allow a wipe down and cleaning of the generator.  The Turbine Unit will remain assembled during this first performance period.   <BR><BR>Second performance period:  The Government will be issuing a separate contract for a generator stator winding installation of Turbine Unit 3.  The selected winding installation contractor will disassemble Turbine Unit 3, removing the turbine generator rotor and placing it on a pedestal within the dam.  It is anticipated that the rotor may be contaminated with brake dust containing asbestos and will need to be cleaned.  Additionally, the stator bars may be wrapped with an armor tape which may be an asbestos containing material.  If so, the stator bars will need to be removed for disposal.<BR><BR>Quantities of asbestos are not yet determined however asbestos was recently removed from Generator 1 & 2 in the stator bar armor tape, rotor pole field coil insulation and in brake dust.  It is anticipated there will be similar findings in Main Unit 3.  The majority of the work however will constitute removal of Asbestos Contaminated Dust from the Generator Housing and Components.  This dust contains  less than 1% asbestos and thus is non-regulated asbestos.  The Government wants the contractor to treat this material as an asbestos containing material and to abide by the appropriate Federal and State Asbestos Regulations.   <BR><BR>In addition, this work includes the incidental procedures and equipment required preventing the airborne release of, and protecting workers and occupants of the buildings and/or areas from contact with, asbestos fibers.  During the performance of the contract, the laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations of Federal, State, Regional, and local authorities shall be complied with regarding the removal, storage, transportation, and disposal of asbestos-containing materials.  Where the requirements of these specifications and Federal, State, Regional or local regulations vary, the most stringent requirements shall be enforced.<BR><BR>Site visit:  a site visit will be offered approximately 10 days after the solicitation is made available to bidders.  The solicitation will include details regarding the site visit.<BR><BR>Other information:  The solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities web site (www.fbo.gov) when released.  Quotes/Proposals will be due approximately 3 weeks after the actual solicitation issuance date. This is scheduled to be issued as a Labor Hours (Time and Materials) contract.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.    <BR><BR>Set-aside status:  The solicitation is scheduled to be issued as a 100% Small Business set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs).  The North American Industry Classification System code for this requirement is 562910 size standard:  $14 Million average annual income.   <BR><BR>Place of Contract Performance:  Lower Granite Dam, 885 Almota Ferry Road, Pomeroy, WA  99347-9632<BR><BR>Conducting Business with the Government:  In order for contractors to conduct business with the Department of Defense, the contractor must provide registration information to the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). All Offerors must be CCR registered prior to receiving an award.  Registration instructions may be obtained, and online registration may be accomplished, at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The USDA is looking for an equipment to extract good quality genomic DNA from hard to lyse fungal cells.  In our previous studies we have used various types of tissue lyser's and shredders, for sample preparation, however, these were not very effective in extracting good quality DNA from conidia of powdery mildew pathogen of cucurbits and sporangia of the downy mildew pathogen.  The system should be easy to use and must allow for rapid and reproducible preparation of the samples to be used for extraction of good quality DNA.  The system should use cycling hydrostatic pressure to help lyse or shred the samples.  A combination of pressure and temperature to lyse the cells will work too.  The system should not be based on the use of glass or ceramic beads to shred the pathogen cells.  

USDA is interested in doing a rental for three months with the option to buy.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br /><br />The purpose of this announcement is two-fold. The first purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform this potential requirement. The second purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.<br /><br />Background: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is responsible for conducting acquisitions in support of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This potential project is intended to assist NIOSH in fulfilling its mission of eliminating occupational diseases, injuries, and fatalities from the mining workplace through a focused program of research and prevention. As part of its Strategic Goals, NIOSH is to "assist the mining community to maintain and improve mine escape, rescue, and emergency response capabilities through realistic training exercises and the development and implementation of new or improved training aids and exploration, rescue, and escape technologies."<br /><br />Purpose and Objectives: NIOSH plans to create a Mine Rescue and Escape Training Laboratory in Pittsburgh, PA which includes a two-part virtual reality system. One component will be a 360 degree stereoscopic immersive environment appropriate for group training situations and the other will be a large curved screen display appropriate for 3D visualization and display of 2D content. The trainee audiences are mine rescue team members and the general workforce of underground coal mines in the United States.<br /><br />Project Requirements: The Government seeks to purchase a turnkey solution which will include procurement and installation of hardware and related software and training on use of the system. Demonstration software for system training and for demonstration of system capabilities must be included. Four training modules for use with the system are also required. The training is to be set in a virtual environment which includes an underground coal mine longwall panel and a development section.<br /><br />The immersive environment must be large enough for simultaneous training and observation of a full mine rescue team with 3 other individuals playing the role of "victims" during the session. The projection screen must be 360 degrees and tall enough to give the illusion of wrapping overhead of the trainees. The proposed installation site is approximately 43 feet by 46 feet with a height of approximately 18 feet. Suggested screen dimensions are approximately 10 meters (32.8 feet) in diameter by 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) high. The image projected must be seamless. The projection system must allow the display of both 3D and 2D content. Methods for trainee interaction with the virtual environment and for capturing trainee responses during training are required. The potential for adding motion tracking capabilities to the system in the future is desired. Surround sound audio capabilities must be included.<br /><br />The curved screen will be used for projecting training modules, such as those related to hazard recognition or equipment maintenance, and geological or engineering data sets. It should not rely on head tracking for point of view. The display should have the capability to provide one seamless image. A method for displaying traditional content, such as slides and video, should also be provided. Surround sound audio capabilities must be included. The proposed installation site is approximately 9.1 meters (29.9 feet) wide with a floor to ceiling height of 3.4 meters (11.2 feet). Maximum screen size within those dimensions is preferred.<br /><br />Software providing a training environment which includes longwall panel and a development section in a virtual underground coal mine is required. Four training modules to be set in the "virtual mine" should be appropriate for use during federally mandated underground coal mine training sessions. Two modules should be simulations similar in content and length to mine rescue problems which are conducted during mine rescue contests. Two modules should be simulations for general miners covering knowledge and skills needed for successful emergency mine evacuations. Module content outlines will be provided by NIOSH. Interactive elements and a method for capturing trainee responses are required. The four modules will be used for research and demonstration purposes by NIOSH staff. Ability for NIOSH researchers to make future modifications to the software is desired.<br /><br />Anticipated Period of Performance: A system is to be installed and fully operational with 2 training modules at the NIOSH site within 6 months after the award of a contract. The final 2 modules must be complete within 9 months after award of a contract.<br /><br />Other Important Considerations: This project is currently contingent upon approval of facility modifications and commitment of funding.<br /><br />Capability Statement / Information Sought: A capability statement should be submitted in response to this notice. In order to ensure full consideration by the Government, the submission should include the following -<br /><br />(1) Respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact (with telephone number and email address), and size and type of business (e.g., large, small, HUBZone, SDVO, 8(a), veteran-owned, woman-owned, or SDB) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code elsewhere identified in this notice.<br /><br />(2) Respondents' opinions about the difficulty and/or feasibility of the potential requirement or proposed acquisition, possible solutions and approaches that may currently exist in the marketplace, and information regarding innovative ideas or concepts.<br /><br />(3) Respondents' information in regard to; (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.<br /><br />Any information provided by the Respondent but not requested by the Government under this notice, such as a Respondents' rough order of magnitude of cost or time required for the project, would be used for planning purposes only. Detailed estimates are not requested nor desired.<br /><br />Information Submission Instructions: To ensure consideration under this notice, submissions should -<br /><br />* Be submitted by email attachment (in PDF format only) to the Contracting Officer's email address provided elsewhere in this notice by not later than the response date also provided elsewhere in this notice.<br /><br />* Be organized in the order outlined in the submission content instructions (1-3e above)<br /><br />* Be limited to 10 pages (including any reference pages)<br /><br />Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response.

<SUBJECT>Information Request for the Objective Simulation Framework Capability for the Ballistic Missile Defense System
<SOLNBR>HQ0006-XX-RFI-2_Objective_Simulation_Framework
<RESPDATE>012210
<ARCHDATE>01232010
<CONTACT>Edward A. Langwinski, Contracting Officer, Phone 2564501412, Email edward.langwinski@mda.mil
<DESC>1. Background:  Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack.

2. Description:

a. Request for Information (RFI).  MDA is continuing to seek sources to enhance its current suite of modeling and simulation (M&S) frameworks.  The current frameworks (the Digital Simulation Architecture [DSA] and the Single Stimulation Framework [SSF]) integrate models from each of the BMDS program elements into a system that accurately represents the performance of fielded BMDS equipment against a variety of threats in realistic environments.  The desired framework, hereafter called Objective Simulation Framework (OSF), will leverage existing or mature capabilities, develop common interfaces, or propose a combination of both, to join digital and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) representations into a modular, scalable, reconfigurable, and compose-able system.  The RFI is seeking contractors who are able to design, develop, test, field and maintain an OSF that can be used for a variety of applications to include BMDS ground tests and performance assessments.  Additionally, the OSF, in its various configurations, will meet Warfighter requirements for wargames, exercises and training events; support execution of the MDA Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP); address the system engineers requirements for concept analysis; and speak to Element requirements for element integration.  Data collection, centralized execution controls, and common models such as threats, lethality, and phenomenology are functions required to be addressed by the OSF. 

b. Design Objective.  By evolving this desired OSF, the Governments objective is to integrate digital M&S capabilities with the HWIL M&S capabilities.  This evolution would include complete data collection capabilities across the M&S system to support BMDS system level analysis with common threats, lethality, and phenomenology models.

c. BMDS Elements.  The BMDS elements include the following:

(1) Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense 
(2) Airborne Laser (ABL)
(3) Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD)
(4) Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target (PATRIOT)
(5) Sensors 
- COBRA DANE
- Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX)
- Upgraded Early Warning Radars (UEWRs)
- Ballistic Missile Early Warning Systems (BMEWS)
- Forward Based X-Band Transportable (FBX-T) Radar AN/TPY-2/TPS-X/Forward Deployable Radar (FDR)
(6) Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS)
(7) Defense Support Program (DSP) / Space-Based Infra-Red System (SBIRS)
(8) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
(9) Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communication (C2BMC)

d. Future Systems.  The description does not fully account for all future element models that may be represented in the OSF.  Each future element model may require one or more digital and HWIL simulations to enable engineering, development, and testing of that element.  Thus, while each future system may be developed at different times and to different specifications, the design must allow these systems to be compatible with the developed OSF.  Moreover, since multiple nodes with associated hardware and software may be required at a number of locations, the developed OSF communication system between these locations must be secure and variably configured depending on the number of participating nodes.  In addition, the framework should be able to operate in a variety of classified environments (including unclassified, collateral, and multinational).  Finally, concurrent operation of the OSF during element or system-level testing must not interfere with the normal operation of each elements primary operational mission.

e. OSF Desired End-State.  The OSF desired end-state is the full integration of digital and HWIL capabilities.  OSF will provide the framework and defined interface standards supporting the system-level capability.  The integration methodology should maximize interoperability while considering the geographical separation of MDA operating locations.  The performance of individual models will be the responsibility of the elements.  The OSF must be able to run in real time and non-real time (faster and slower than real time).  It must also support models that run in real time and non-real time, and that use either discrete event stepping or time stepping.  The OSF design must permit effective operation with all current MDA digital and/or HWIL representations and operate within the current and anticipated MDA infrastructure for execution, data recording, and analysis.  The proposed OSF solution would include a complete data collection capability across the M&S single system to support BMDS system level analysis.  The OSF must provide common threat and environmental information to all models.  The categories of common threat and environment include phenomenology, lethality, environment, communications, and threat.  Finally, OSF must be able to operate in either a purely digital environment, a purely HWIL one, or a hybrid.

f. OSF Use Cases.  The OSF must be able to support the following use cases: 

(1) Ground Testing.  BMDS-level M&S supporting virtual and live ground tests of configurations of BMDS operational and development assets to verify performance, exchange information, and assess system behavior. 

(2) Training.  BMDS-level M&S supporting activities enabling battle staffs to develop proficiency in planning and applying BMDS assets in live simulated scenarios.

(3) Exercises.  BMDS-level M&S supporting activities in which BMDS operators and commanders practice skills and apply BMDS concepts of operation (CONOPS) and tactics, techniques and procedure (TTPs) in live simulations using scenarios containing current system and threat capabilities.

(4) Element Integration.  The elements use BMDS-level M&S to drive their prime mission equipment components to assess the effectiveness of the components, verify requirements, perform trade studies, and evaluate interfaces and interoperability.

(5) Performance Assessment.  BMDS-level M&S supporting performance assessment of fielded BMDS configurations to verify the capability of a BMDS configuration to meet system-level quantitative measures of effectiveness (MOEs) or performance (MOPs) against specified threat scenarios.

(6) Wargames.  BMDS-level M&S supports virtual wargaming activities to perform human-in-the-loop experimentation for developing new BMDS CONOPS and TTPs and complement international BMD cooperative ventures.

(7) Concept Analysis.  BMDS-level M&S supporting constructive simulation for BMDS-level concept analysis including needs determination, concept exploration, and trade studies of BMDS alternatives.

g. Place of performance.  Includes, but not limited to, facilities in the following locations: National Capitol Region; Huntsville, Alabama; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Sunnyvale, California; Los Angeles, California; Tucson, Arizona; Fort Greely, Alaska; Honolulu, Hawaii; Omaha, Nebraska; Dahlgren, Virginia; Boston, Massachusetts as well as other potential MDA CONUS and OCONUS locations.  

h. Government-Furnished Information (GFI) / Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE).  GFI/GFE is TBD.  Interested parties may recommend GFI/GFE to be included as part of any resulting OSF acquisition.  Additionally, OSF design may require access to other suppliers proprietary information and equipment.  As such, if applicable, any resulting solicitation and proposal will require that the vendor negotiate agreements with these suppliers and contractors to obtain any such information or equipment.  

3. Responses:  The intended outcome of this synopsis is to determine interest and capability in supporting the OSF development.  

MDA is requesting contractors interested in this acquisition submit a capability statement that demonstrates core capabilities and expertise.  This RFI augments the previous OSF RFI posted in July 2009.  Capability Statements shall be unclassified.  Capability statements are limited to a maximum of fifteen (15) pages excluding the cover page.  Capability statements in excess of fifteen (15) pages may not be reviewed.  The cover page should contain: (1) company name and address, (2) primary point of contact and one alternate, (3) telephone number and email address, (4) Cage Code, (5) NAICS code, (6) small business category, if applicable, and, (7) Federal Supply Schedule, General Services Administration contract number, if applicable.  For electronic correspondence, please use the following subject line:  HQ0006-XX-RFI Objective Simulation Framework.  MDA will not acknowledge receipt of responses to this RFI.  If a receipt is desired, potential sources should submit statements via e-mail and select read receipt request from electronic mail options.

In addition to confirming that the RFI respondent can meet the Governments OSF requirements, capability statements should demonstrate core capabilities and expertise in each of the following areas: 

(1) Provide knowledge of and experience with working with time stepped, conservative discrete event and optimistic discrete event types of modeling systems.

<DESC>The Program Manager, Training Systems, Marine Corps Systems Command, Orlando, FL desires to increase, without full and open competition, the contract ceiling of contract M67854-06-C-8051, awarded to Cole Engineering Services Inc. (CESI), 3361 Rouse Road, Suite 215, Orlando, FL 32817-2136.  This action is to increase the current ceiling by $4.9M from a total contract amount of $29.6M to a new contract amount of $34.5M.  The current contract was a sole-source award to CESI, due to their unique technical knowledge and experience for the continued development and initial delivery of the Combined Arms Command and Control Trainer Upgrade System (CACCTUS).  CESI's ongoing experience and intimate knowledge of the CACCTUS system and it's many components makes it's solely qualified to meet rigid FY10 programmed deliveries.  The object of this modification is to complete development, design, integration, and test efforts to meet system capability and training requirements as defined in the Increment I CACCTUS Capabilities Design Document (CDD). This includes the development and delivery of CACCTUS version 5.2 in October 2010. Version 5.2 includes integration of and modifications to OneSAF version 3.0.6 as well as integration and fielding of a new 3D viewer, additional C4 integration, CACCTUS specific GUI enhancements, updated terrain databases and a host of other enhancements to functionality.  This effort also requires the developer to complete initial equipment delivery to the remaining three sites (Camp Pendleton CA, MCB Hawaii, and Okinawa Japan).  The contractor will integrate, test, and deliver to all three sites, a CACCTUS system with current versions of the CACCTUS software.  Contractor will also deliver and install version 5.2 to all five sites once approved by the government. Delivery schedule and locations will be determined during IPT sessions following contract modification; however all deliveries must occur within the current period of performance, ending on 26 July 2011.
A follow-on contract for further development in order to meet Final Operational Capability (FOC) and sustainment of the system is anticipated in FY11 using full and open competition.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Group, Denver, Colorado, intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) with Revey Associates, Inc., 9250 East Morning Star Place, Parker CO 80134
Description of the supplies or services: The Phase II Modifications at Folsom Dam is the second phase of a multi-phase construction project jointly developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and Reclamation.  The Phase II Modifications consist of excavating several million cubic yards of rock and common material to form the base for future construction of a reinforced concrete auxiliary spillway by the Corps. The auxiliary spillway is to be located between a newly constructed four lane highway and the existing Folsom Dam. The area available for the construction of the auxiliary spillway is very constricted with little or no room for over excavation without impacting either the new highway or the existing dam. The Corps' first contract to begin the reinforced auxiliary spillway structure is to be awarded at the completion of the Phase II Modifications. This is a multi-million dollar contract that depends on the completion of the Phase II Modifications.  A delay in the completion of the Phase II Modifications contract will delay future contracts and result in cost increase to the project and the Government.  
The contractor will advise/assist Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) engineers and construction support personnel with ongoing blasting operations at the Folsom Dam Phase II Safety of Dams Modifications construction site.  The consultant will work with Reclamation and contractor personnel to alleviate blasting related concerns at the construction site that threaten to add significant cost and risk to the project.  The complicated condition of the geology at the construction site has lead to large increases in required slope support, caused over excavation due to localized slope failures, and threatens to result in delay to the completion of the project.  
Revey Associates, Inc is uniquely qualified to fulfill this requirement due to their extensive knowledge and experience with blasting and controlled blasting methods, along with extensive knowledge of this site conditions in and around Folsom Dam.  Revey Associates, Inc has been working at the Folsom Dam site for approximately 15 years and is familiar with the unique subsurface site conditions and has extensive knowledge of the geology at and around Folsom Dam.  As stated above the geology of this area is complicated.  It is highly jointed with varying degrees of weathering being found throughout the excavation matrix.  Highly weathered rock material is being encountered below competent less weathered rock which is an unusual condition.
Award to another contractor would adversely effect the government. First, another contractor would have to become familiar with the unique subsurface site conditions and geology at and around Folsom Dam before they could provide the required services at the site. This lead time would result in a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Further, allowing another contractor time to become familiar with the site conditions at Folsom Dam would result in significant delays to the current phase of construction. This delay would also adversely effect the performance start date of the Corps' contract to reinforce the auxiliary spillway structure. This contract is estimated at over $500 million and schedule delays would likely result in substantial excess costs to the government that is also unlikely to be recovered through competition. 
Competition is restricted to only one source IAW FAR 13.106-1(b). This procurement will be awarded using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, capability statements received by 1200 MST January 8, 2010 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses to this notice shall submitted to Rob Brackett, Contract Specialist via email to rbrackett@usbr.gov

<SUBJECT>Assignment Management System DRAFT RFP

<RESPDATE>012810
<CONTACT>Andrea  Katz, Contract Specialist, Phone 2028749933, Email andrea.katz@occ.treas.gov
<DESC>Enclosed is a "DRAFT" Request for Proposal (RFP) for the acquisition of an Assignment Management System (AMS) for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). In an effort to promote open dialog with industry, the OCC requests that potential vendors provide comments, questions and/or recommendations regarding this draft RFP.
 
AMS is expected to improve the quality, consistency and timeliness of matter, project and assignment information as it is used and reported across CCO, especially including all of the information needed by the First Senior Deputy Comptroller/Chief Counsels (FSDC/CC) to manage the Law Department, the Licensing Department and the Community Affairs Department.

The AMS will enable CCO employees to standardize entering, tracking, and updating project/assignment information as well as creating the appropriate status reports required for both division managers and CCO overall. The new AMS will provide CCO managers and staff with an enhanced assignment portfolio management capability, resulting in improved communication and reporting to CCO management and to CCO customers including the OCC bank examiner community.

In many government and commercial enterprises, OCCs AMS would be referred to as an assignment, case, or matter management system.
 
Please note that the OCC is NOT looking for vendors to submit technical or price proposals.  This Draft RFP is issued for the sole purpose of allowing industry to provide input concerning:
1)RFP documentation  Any proposed changes, additions, considerations, or clarifications related to the RFP as issued in draft form.  These proposed changes can address the SOO, terms and conditions or both.
2)Documentation  Any proposed changes, additions, considerations, or clarifications related to the RFP attachments.  This would include, for example, concerns related to the Requirements Documentation. (e.g. What areas require greater clarity? Is there anything that should be updated, added, deleted? Is the information contained with this document sufficient to implement the system?).
3)Platforms/Capabilities  Vendors may suggest software platforms or capabilities they feel are key to project success.  Please be sure to reference the documentation (e.g. SOO, TRM) provided to determine if components within the existing OCC infrastructure can be leveraged.   (Please note that this is not an invitation for vendors to submit a technical proposal).
4)Potential Cost Range  Vendors are requested to provide input on a rough order of magnitude for the cost of this effort based on their experience and expertise (Please note that this is not a request for a formal quote).
5)Schedule Estimate  Factors, which would affect the time it would take to deploy a solution, including how long should it take before the system is operational; the specification of interim milestones/timeframes to achieve those dates, and any other information/recommendations relevant to scheduling. 
6)Experience  Describe your level of experience, as related to the Draft RFP, in implementing similar systems in general.  Pease describe your level of experience implementing similar systems specifically for organizations similar to OCCs Chief Counsels Office.

The Government welcomes any information submitted by interested parties in response to this request and encourages participation from both large and small businesses. Comments, whether supportive or critical, are earnestly solicited regarding every aspect of the proposed initiative. The Government will not critique a potential offerors comments. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this announcement. 

Vendors are highly encouraged to submit capabilities statements; these must distinctly reflect the firms expertise and ability to provide the products and services necessary to meet the objectives of the SOO. At a minimum, the firm should include an overview of the companys corporate information, and a description of the firms demonstrated capabilities, expertise and experience to perform the requirements contained in the draft Statement of Objectives. 

Multiple solutions and approaches are encouraged; however, they must be submitted in a manner that reflects a distinct separation from each other. Failure to provide documentation may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. When submitting responses, vendors must clearly identify any information it considers sensitive or proprietary. All information received in response to this Draft RFP that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this Draft RFP will not be returned. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated and incurred by responding to this Draft RFP. Eligibility to participate in a future acquisition is not predicated on a response to this notice. 

DISCLAIMER: This Draft RFP is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services. Responses to this Draft RFP shall not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice.

Please submit responses via email to Andrea Katz, Contract Specialist, at Andrea.Katz@occ.treas.gov no later than 4:00 P.M. EST on January 28, 2010.  Include your company name, contact person, address, telephone, number(s) facsimile number(s), email address and business size/ socioeconomic status with your response.

<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE USEPA REGION 5 START CONTRACTOR UNDER EP-S5-06-04. REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE USEPA TO AWARD A TASK ORDER UNDER AN EXISTING CONTRACT.</p>
<p>This project provides American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds for Brownfields study and cleanup plan. The project site will be at the former Konrady Oil property at 500 West 19th Avenue in Gary, IN, and have a period of performance from the date of award to July 30, 2010. Requirements for the Task Order include the following: 1) attending meeting(s) and conference calls with city, waste and EPA representatives; 2) preparing a site-specific Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and Health &amp; Safety Plan (HASP); 3) preparing a site-specific Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP); 4) conducting Phase II field/investigation work including tank removal if necessary; 5) preparing the Phase II Assessment Report; 6) preparing cleanup and tank removal cost estimates if necessary; 7) preparing the Property Profile Form (PPF) or entering site-specific information into EPA ACRES Database; 8) complying with the documentation and reporting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (AARA) of 2009.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ("ARRA" or "the Act") contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's START (Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team) contracts were awarded as IDIQ contracts, they were awarded competitively with fixed rates, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the type of services to be performed. The existing START contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance and to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing START contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

5. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE

NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions). Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent (50%) of the cost  or in-kind effort of a project under this initiative be provided by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects. Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other_trans.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research. Final decision(s) on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government.

NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

6. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

No request for proposal (RFP), solicitation or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Proposals may be submitted at any time up and to the closing date of the BAA. Offerors are instructed to submit Proposals only for actual technologies within the areas of interest listed in previous paragraphs. The government will not respond to request for oral discussions of potential technologies. Submit proposals in two (2) phases.

6.1.1 Important Information for Prospective Contractors

Current registration in the DoDs Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will be a prerequisite for receiving an award resulting from this BAA. For more information please contact the CCR Assistance Center at 1-888-227-2423.

6.2 PHASE II  FULL PROPOSAL

6.2.1 General Information

Only Offerors whose Phase I - Proposal Abstract is considered capable of meeting Program requirements will be asked to submit Phase II  which are Full Proposals. 

 Request for submission of a full proposal does not&#61656; guarantee award selection.

Proposals shall be submitted in original, with the signature of an authorizing official, with five (5) copies to the address noted above. Proposal submission is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities are encouraged to participate. The NAICS Code for this BAA is 541710. 

Submit Full Proposals in two (2) volumes; 

a)  VOLUME I  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL, not to exceed thirty (30) pages, should include the following three sections: 

1) Section 1 - Executive Summary: Provide a brief technical and business description of the contents of the proposal. The technical area should address the proposal's technical goals, approach, and expected results. The business area should address business and/or commercial applications of the proposal technology. 

2) Section 2 - Technical Issues: Detail the technical approach, objectives, staffing and resources relating to the development of the proposed technology for military and commercial (if applicable) use; discuss specifically in realistic terms the technical objectives of this proposed effort; provide a Statement of Work (SOW) that discusses the specific tasks to be accomplished, tied to the specific approach and goals of the project; provide resumes for Principle Investigator(s) and other key research personnel; describe the current and planned facilities and equipment to accomplish the research objectives; and, give a description of past performance on similar efforts including  initial office set-up. 

3) Section 3 - Business Issues: Discuss the business issues relating to the commercial applications of the proposed development and its impact on the market; detail benefits to the Department of Defense (DoD), if applicable.

b)  VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals are not restricted in length, have no specific page layout requirements, and should address funding periods of performance. Formal work breakdown structures (WBS) and certified cost or pricing data are neither required nor desired, however, NAVAIR reserves the right to request this information for proposals using FAR/DFARS type contracts. Organize Cost/Funding proposals to include four (4) sections in the following order:

1) Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown of costs of the project. Cost should also be broken for each task appearing in the Statement of Work (SOW) and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share (mandatory for certain "other transaction agreements" see above); funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing. 

2) Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions: This section will include: (i) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; (ii) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; and (iii) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash in the future. Affirmative, signed statements are required from outside sources of cash. Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions? 

3) Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort, which is not covered, by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement. Present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made. 

4) Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements. 

NOTE: Proposals will not be accepted after the due date stated on Page One (1).

7. EVALUATION CRITERIA 

The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement. 

7.1 EVALUATION CRITERIA

The primary evaluation criteria are: 

a) Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered; and

b) The offerors capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research investigators/personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; and

c) The realism and reasonableness of cost, including proposed cost sharing. 

d) The proximity of the institution to NAWCAD necessary to allow use and access to the facilities at both the NAWC and the institution while minimizing cost in time and travel.7. AWARDS

NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated in Section 2 and 3. All awards will be based on merit competition. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If a full cost proposal is requested by the contracting officer, and the total exceeds $550,000, any large business is required to include a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with the FAR.

Brand Name Justification:
IHS adopted the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) VistA Imaging (VI) System program in 2006, to serve as its multimedia component for the RPMS Electronic Health Record (HER).  VI enables HER users to view scanned documents and clinical images (photos, radiographs, etc/) that are linked to a patients electronic record.  It also provides Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) capabilities for the long-term storage of images.

Because VI is classified as a Medical Device by the FDA, the VHAs VI development office is required to certify hardware and software configurations that are available for sites to purchase.  Sites with VI Systems run a certified configuration in order to remain in compliance.  
IHS is in the process of procuring new VI equipment and software for the Areas not currently using the program and purchasing additional equipment for the Areas that need to expand.  

The VA has certified the ImageGear software for the VistA Imaging System and it is required for all VistA Imaging Systems.  ImageGear is only produced by Pegasus Imaging Corporation.  Pegasus does not have resellers for the IG MD SVR License: Medical W32 Medical Imaging Functionality Configuration.

<p>The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation (available from http://farsite.hill.af.mil)</p>
<p>52.212-1 - INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. A purchase order will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror representing the best value to the Government. An evaluation of "Technically Acceptable" will be assigned when the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal and the offeror's qualifications meet the performance and technical capability requirements defined in the PWS. Proposal must be submitted on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>-- Offers shall initially be ranked according to price, as identified above. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified by the proposed unit price for each Item to confirm the extended amount. The price evaluation process will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>--Next, the government technical team shall evaluate, on a pass/fail basis, the technical proposals submitted by the lowest priced offerors (approximately the lowest five proposals) against the following evaluation factor:</p>
<p>Technical Capability - An evaluation of "Technically Acceptable" will be assigned when the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal and the offeror's qualifications meet the performance and technical capability requirements defined in the PWS.</p>
<p>--By submission of an offer, the offeror accedes to these terms. Award will be made without discussions - contractors are encouraged to offer their most advantageous pricing with their response. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and a technical standpoint. Failure of an Offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p>--Once determinations are made regarding technical acceptability of proposals, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror who submitted a proposal rated technically acceptable.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC><p>THE ANSWER TO QUESTION 1 OF&nbsp;AMENDMENT 00004 IS REDACTED.&nbsp; THE QUESTION # 1 AND ANSWER IS&nbsp;AS FOLLOWS:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; ARE THE EXISTING SWITCHES AIR OPERATED?<br /><br />The switches are air controlled, with a compressed air line already ran. However, the line is ran along and attached to the railing that needs to be taken down.&nbsp;There is no problem with the air line being reused, but the contractor will have to account for it during demo. It might be able to be anchored to the building structure while the railing is being taken down. If not, it will probably have to be removed and reattached on the new railing once it goes up. <br /><br /><br /><br />PROPOSALS ARE STILL DUE TODAY, 30 DEC 2009 AT 4:00 PM</p>

<DESC>The following changes are made to solicitation W91QV1-10-T-0005. Small Business set-aside is changed to unrestricted. Previously this infromation was not available but due to the nature of the work being performed (blood drive that targets only the cadets on West Point that have no transportation to any nearby hotels) the only accomodations that are acceptable must be located on West Point. Based on this information this requirement is being offered as a sole source to The Thayer Hotel.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS - STRI HEADSTONE ALIGNMENT/CLEANING 
QUESTION 1. The headstones located in the referenced areas A, B, I, P, Q, R, S and T are civil war headstones and differ in dimension from those discussed in the Description of work. The civil war headstones are only 10 inches wide and only extend up from the ground approximately 16 inches and the stone's overall length is only 33 inches. If we hold to the specifications and raise the stones to 25 inches there will not be enough stone in the ground to hold the stone securely in place. 
ANSWER 1. The Civil War headstones are generally up to 35 inches overall length. These stones should be 18 inches in the ground, and 17 inches above ground. The specification was a reference to the modern stones that are 42 inches long. If we find that the stones are only 33 inches, then we can adjust this depth to bury 16 inches, and leave 17 inches above ground. The square unknown stones length is 29  inches. We think 12 inches above ground is about right. All need to be consistent. 
QUESTION 2. The ground is very soft due to molls. The specifications call for a one year guarantee against movement with the contractor being responsible for repair in the event that the stones are moved. How can the contractor be responsible for events beyond his control such as undermining by molls, lawnmower strikes, children playing on the stones, ground movement due to freezing, vandalism, etc.? 
ANSWER 2. The contractor would not be responsible for events beyond his control. 
QUESTION 3. The stones are very old. The specifications say that the contractor is responsible for any broken stones. I believe that it is quite possible that freezing and weather and possibly past abuse may already have damaged the stones, a condition that will not be discovered until the stones are removed. How will it be determined if the stones were broken prior to removal or were just too weak to be removed without breaking? 
ANSWER 3. If the contractor damages stones in the process of the project, he is responsible for repairing the stones. We will provide the guidance. If a stone is already damaged, the contractor should bring it to the attention of the COTR. 
QUESTION 4. Are we realigning and resetting designated headstones that are already in place or all the head stones? 
ANSWER 4. Each section needs to be aligned in each direction and the stones should be of uniform height at the completion of the project. They will all probably have to be reset with gravel. 
QUESTION  5. Can we use sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) at 30 to 45 psi this is what was used on the statue of liberty it is Eco friendly and will not harm the headstones or the environment. This is a soft media blasting and is this acceptable type of media to be used? 
ANSWER 5. We will consult with historic preservation specialists to determine if this is acceptable. If not, pressure washing at the specified pressure will be acceptable.

QUESTION  6.  Usually turf renovation is done with conjunction with Alignment project; byleveling, grading, filling in sunken graves, and installing new sod, isthere any new sod or will this be considered?
ANSWER 6.  Our Maintenance folks will take care of all filling of sunken graves, grading, and leveling as well as revegetation. There will be no sod to deal with.
QUESTION 7.  What type of stone are the Tombstones made of? 
ANSWER 7.  The military headstones are marble.
QUESTION 8. Would it be feasible to use high tech tools to refinish these other than using cleaning soaps or solvents?  
ANSWER 8.  The specs for cleaning include only water and a high pressure washer set at less than 300 PSI. No solvents, soaps or other equipment is needed or approved.
 QUESTION 9.  What are sizes of marble headstones?
ANSWER 9.  All the headstones are marble. There are a number of different sizes. The Civil War stones are generally 3 1/2" x 9 3/4" x 35".  However, there are variations. Spanish American War stones in section P vary slightly from that. Modern stones are 4" x 13" x 42". There are also variations in them. 
When straightening stones, you measure on center. 
QUESTION 10.  How high above the ground are the stones?
ANSWER 10.  For 34" and 35" stones, 18" is above ground. 
QUESTION 11. How many Civil War stones and how many Unknown?
ANSWER 11.  Sections A, B, and I contain unknown markers. Overall, of the Civil War graves, about 40% are unknown. Section I is about 75% unknown. Sections P, Q, R, S, and T have no unknown markers. 
QUESTION 12. Is water available?
ANSWER 12. Yes, we have unmetered well water.
QUESTION 13.  Do the sections have control markers?
ANSWER 13. No, we do not have control markers. You work off rows in the adjacent sections. 
QUESTION 14.  Is there any likelihood that this solicitation will be extended beyond 01/06/10?
ANSWER 14.  The government does not intend to extend the solicitation beyond 01/06/10.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO.

BACKGROUND

 The Return Review Program (RRP) is a mission-critical, automated system that will be used to enhance IRS capabilities to detect, resolve, and prevent criminal and civil non-compliance thereby reducing issuance of fraudulent tax refunds.  The 1993 Malcolm Sparrow Report determined that annual losses estimated at several billions of dollars were attributable to paper and electronic tax returns fraud and identified a gap between the IRS technological service competence and its technological compliance competence.  In 1994, the Palmer Task Force recommended to Congress that a pre-refund automated fraud control process be developed to significantly reduce IRS losses from fraudulent tax refunds.  The IRSs Questionable Refund Program (QRP) has as its objective the timely detection, investigation and prevention of questionable tax return-based refunds.  The current-state QRP uses a data-driven approach that depends upon the Electronic Fraud Detection System (EFDS) capabilities to store and process large data sets, mine data to identify questionable refunds, query data to identify individual and mass non-compliance which may lead to the identification of potential criminal investigations, and to conduct research, trigger the required taxpayer notifications, and monitor aging and status.  

The Electronic Fraud Detection System (EFDS) is used to detect potential fraud of tax refunds in individual income tax returns (IRS form 1040).  As the system ages, it has been unable to keep up changes in the tax code or current business priorities.  The IRS has determined that a replacement for EFDS is needed, and has designated this application as the Return Review Program (RRP).  RRP will take the existing EFDS functionality, and improve it by adding new features, a more robust scoring ability, and making the system in line with the IRS Enterprise Architecture.

OBJECTIVE

To achieve RRPs objectives, the IRS has determined that a system will be created in four Transition States as defined below.  Overall functionality of the system must include data mining and modeling, predictive analytics, fraud scheme detection, real-time fraud scoring, workload management and work stream identification based on fraud score card analysis, as well as the ability to incorporate real-time business rule changes.

Transition State One (TS1) will create a new relational database with tools to assist in detection and prevention of fraudulent submissions

1.Provide data interfaces

2.Provide dynamic pattern recognition across tax returns

3.Provide analytical tools to predict future fraud


Transition State Two (TS2) will replace the current Electronic Fraud Detection System (EFDS) functionality.  EFDS is an automated system that is used to maximize fraud detection at the time tax returns are filed to eliminate the issuing of questionable refunds.  EFDS supports the following business capability needs:

o Receive and maintain large amounts of data from a variety of sources (internal and external).
o Execute data mining algorithms to develop data models that identify questionable and fraudulent returns.
o Establish tolerances to create workload inventories.
o Assign and transfer workload.
o Review potentially false tax returns and develop scheme referrals 
o Capture statistical information and track the status of schemes. 
o Track employer contact information and W-2 verification status.
o Record the disposition of a return.
o Compare current year return information to previous years 
o Analyze business entity information.
o Readily see if the taxpayer worked for the same employer in the previous years and whether the income reported on a return matches information submitted by employers.
o Case Processing
o Inventory Management
o MIS reporting 
o Case Treatment Streams

<DESC><p>RECOVERY ACT PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR ROOF AND ENERGY REPAIR AND ALTERATIONS PROJECT, LOCATED IN CHARLESTON, WV, SOLICITATION NO.: GS-03P-10-CD-C-0015.</p>
<p>This project is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act project. The United States General Services Administration has a requirement for the selection of a quality contractor for the "Recovery": Roof and Energy Repair and Alterations project for the Robert C. Byrd Courthouse in Charleston, West Virginia. This project is to be awarded as a firm fixed price contract. The work includes but is not limited to the following: provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary to remove and replace existing roof, installation of roof-supported photovoltaic panels, replacement of existing lighting with LED type fixtures and modification to existing mechanical system to provide further energy and cost savings.</p>
<p>The Robert C. Byrd U. S. Courthouse was selected for its potential energy generation capacity. This project will have a positive savings-to-investment ratio; it will enhance the resilience and security of the building/facility by providing an additional source of power to meet the building/facility's needs while reducing the reliance on local utility providers.</p>
<p>As part of a long-term plan to maintain and modernize government owned facilities, the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to procure construction services outlined within the scope of work intended for this site. This project will enhance the ability of the GSA to move closer to achieving goals outlined in the Energy act of 2007 that include new standards for promoting energy efficiency in government buildings. Consequently, the award of this project will assist in the overall goals of stimulating the economy and creating jobs.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of construction is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, award will be made using best-value, source-selection procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price-related and non-price related factors. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer will preclude further participation on this acquisition.</p>
<p>Award may be made without discussions. The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance: 1.Past Performance, 2. Management and Key Personnel Qualifications, and 3. Technical and Organizational Approach. The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220. This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.</p>
<p>A Pre-proposal conference will be held at the Robert C. Byrd Courthouse in Charleston, West Virginia on a date to be determined. PRIOR NOTIFICATION of attendance to this conference is MANDATORY due to building security. Please provide your Company name and all potential attendees' full names to Stephen Kohri or Raymond Porter via email: Stephen.Kohri@gsa.gov or RaymondJ.Porter@gsa.gov, reference Solicitation Number GS-03P-10-CD-C-0015.</p>

<DESC>This modification will consist in upgrading the facility temporary generator power connection from single phase to 3 phase. This modification will accomplish installing approximately 100 feet of #2, 2AWG, type THWN-THHN wire from the service disconnect to the double throw panel and back to the service panel and will connect to the newly installed 3 phase panel (left of the disconnect). The new wire will be fed through existing conduit to the required areas. A 5/8"x8' grounding rod will be installed and bonded to the manual transfer switch. Once this work is accomplished the "B" phase power leg along with the existing "A" &amp; "C" phase will be connected to the temporary generator power connection which will allow the 3 phase back up generator for this facility to connect and supply temporary power to this facility.

Suite 101, Tampa, FL 33603 US
<DESC>The subject combined synopsis/solicitation was made available on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  An award was made to Pegasus Imaging Corporation in the amount of $43,875.00.  


Rationale for Non-Competitive Contract Action - Pegasus Imaging Corporation is the sole developer and service provider for required products.


The following products were purchased:


IG MD SVR License: Medical W32 Medical Imaging Functionality Configuration: Active Server
Quantity: 5


IG MD SVR License: Medical W32 Medical Imaging Functionality Configuration: Fail Over Server
Quantity: 5




Brand Name Justification  ImageGear

IHS adopted the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) VistA Imaging (VI) System program in 2006, to serve as its multimedia component for the RPMS Electronic Health Record (HER). VI enables HER users to view scanned documents and clinical images (photos, radiographs, etc/) that are linked to a patients electronic record. It also provides Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) capabilities for the long-term storage of images.

Because VI is classified as a Medical Device by the FDA, the VHAs VI development office is required to certify hardware and software configurations that are available for sites to purchase. Sites with VI Systems run a certified configuration in order to remain in compliance. 

IHS is in the process of procuring new VI equipment and software for the Areas not currently using the program and purchasing additional equipment for the Areas that need to expand. 

The VA has certified the ImageGear software for the VistA Imaging System and it is required for all VistA Imaging Systems. ImageGear is only produced by Pegasus Imaging Corporation. Pegasus does not have resellers for the IG MD SVR License: Medical W32 Medical Imaging Functionality Configuration.
