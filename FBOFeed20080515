<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  Anticipated release of the RFQ is on or around 31 March 2008.  The 642 Combat Sustainment Group Contracting Office at Robins AFB, GA has a requirement for two sizes (15-60kW and 200kW) of Generator Wheel Mounting Kits.  The Government intends to award a five year, firm fixed price, long term contract with option years.  The basic quantity is for: 2 each for NSN 6115-00-463-9092 and 1 each for NSN 6115-01-221-8306. The requirement also includes four option years with a quantity of 1-80 each for the 15-60kW wheel kit and 1-8 each for the 200 kW wheel kit.  The Generator Wheel Mounting Kits shall be manufactured in accordance with the Government Purchase Description.  A Pre-Production Unit will be required for each (15-60kW and 200kW) wheel kit, with test plans, test procedures, test reports and data deliverables to be performed by the contractor and approved by the government. This requirement is set aside 100% for small business participation only.

Offerors shall prepare their quotations in accordance with mandatory, explicit and detailed instruction contained in the RFQ.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS! The 45th Contracting Squadron has a sole source requirement for a C20 5-axis vertical milling center manufactured by the Hermle Machine Co., LLC. The system will also include: Heidenhain iTNC 530, main spindle 10,000 RPM, SK40, 30 tool pockets, rigid clamping table, coolant tank unit, swarf pan, manual cabin door and top, polycarbonate panes, CAMplete Truepath options, main spindle 18,000 RPM, HSK-A63, swivell NC-rotary table O 280, T-slots for SRT O 280, secondary clamping plates (2), compressed air supply and miscellaneous accessories (comp. of thermal expansion iTNC, hand-held control unit iTNC, touch probe renishaw, blum tool breakage measurement, swarf flushing nozzle and tooling package). The requested delivery to Patrick AFB, Florida will be approximately thirty (30) days after receipt of a purchase order. This is a Sole Source with Hermle Machine Co., LLC IAW FAR 6.302-1. Hermle Machine Co., LLC is the only source capable of fulfilling the government's requirement as the Hermle C20 offers full 5-axis control utilizing an intuitive control system and is small enough to fit within the confines of the intended facility. A 5-axis machining center will allow complex shapes to be built at extremely high accuracy and at a much faster rate. Other systems of similar capabilities are much larger and will not fit within the facility that it will be housed. The Hermle system also allows a greater reliance on software control versus manual control of equipment. Since the operators will not receive formal machinist training, the control system built into the Hermle will still allow full utilization of the equipment. Two other manufacturers of vertical machining centers were considered in the evaluation but either did not offer the same level of performance and ease of use as the Hermle, or were too large to fit within the facility. This item/service utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 3541 with a business size of 500 employees and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 333512. Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis. 45 CONS/LGCB has determined that Hermle Machine Co., LLC is the only source capable of providing this requirement. Phone calls will not be accepted. Point of contact is Bonnie Pruett, Contract Specialist, 45 CONS/LGCBB, 1201 Edward H. White II, Street MS7200, Patrick AFB, FL 32925, bonnie.pruett@patrick.af.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Education (ED) intends to issue a contract for research to provide information and criteria needed to select the most accurate data source identified in ESEA Title III legislation.  The research findings will provide a basis for the allocation of Title III funds to the States on the more accurate of two allowable sources of data on the population of limited English proficient (LEP) students and immigrant children and youth.  The two allowable sources identified in the Title III legislation are (1) estimates based on the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS), and (2) counts provided by the States.  A recent report by the GAO revealed significant differences in LEP estimates generated using these two data sources and recommended that the Department perform a study to establish the relative accuracy of the two data sources.   The contractor shall implement the study, conducted by a panel of experts, to establish the relative accuracy of the two databases.

ED intends to place a contract on a sole source basis to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253(c ) (1), for a study conducted by a panel of experts, using appropriate methodologies, to examine the relative accuracy of State-collected data vs. U.S. Census Bureau data for determining the number of LEP students used in calculating NCLB Title III allocations to the States.  NAS, which has significant knowledge, technical expertise, and many years of experience in scientific research, is uniquely qualified to conduct the needed research and is the only source that will satisfy ED's requirement.  It is the only organization recognized in legislation as a source of expert advice to the Government, is unequalled in its authority to speak on scientific issues, and unequalled in its reputation for objectivity that transcends any appearance of political influence or advocacy.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Gatan Incorporated, 780 Commonwealth Drive, Warrendale, PA 15086, for the purchase of a high resolution and high performance electron imaging detector (camera) compatible with an electron energy loss spectrometer/image filter attached to a 300 kV transmission electron microscope.  Sole source determination is based on the NIST requirements for an image acquisition device to be attached to a 300 kV TEM that is equipped with an electron energy loss spectrometer (Electron Energy Image Filter).  In order to attach the image acquisition device, the existing EELS must be modified to accommodate the device.  The key technical requirements are as follows:  

1.  11 megapixel CCD sensor (4008 pixels by 2672 pixels) with a high-resolution phosphor scintillator capable of recording electron images and diffraction patterns. The CCD must have a regulated Peltier cooler to keep the dark current low and stable and anti-blooming technology; the CCD must have a minimum of 14-bit data digitization and be capable of frame rates in excess of 14 fps; the sensor must be controlled automatically via a Windows-based software platform capable of saving data in an open format such as TIFF as well as formats compatible with Gatan Microscopy Suite products (DM3-formats).

2.	The CCD camera must mount on the bottom flange of a JEOL 3010 UHR-TEM and provide X-ray shielding to allow safe operation at 300 kV, as well as be pneumatically retractable so as to not interfere with the operation of a pre-existing electron energy loss spectrometer (Gatan Image Filter) instrumentation.

3.	The vendor would be expected to modify the pre-existing Gatan Image Filter so that the focus cross-over of the GIF magnetic sector prism would accommodate the added retractable CCD camera (requirement 1) while guaranteeing that the GIF continues to perform to the original manufacturer’s (both hardware and software) specifications.

As a result, Gatan is uniquely qualified to provide the required instrumentation.  Gatan is the sole manufacturer of the equipment which includes unique and proprietary capabilities that are required to satisfy the Government’s minimum requirements.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination and be completed in accordance with the Contactor’s commercial schedule.

As defined in the federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), FOB Destination means:  The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at delivery point specified in the purchase order, and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider responses received by 
30 May 2008.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC><p>Notice of intent to negoiate a sole source contract with Oregon State University for NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service located in Seattle, Washington for Columbia River ocean area mixed-stock analysis the current proposal seeks to collect and genotype<br />DNA samples, and provide mixed stock analysis (i.e.,<br />GSI) of fish samples collected between Cape Falcon, Oregon and Ledbetter Point, Washington from<br />commercial troll and sports fisheries using the CTC microsatellite baseline for genetic assignment. ,<br />Genetic data is a unique tool that can provide estimates of stock proportions of both wild and hatchery<br />fish samples from a mixed stock fishery. Samples will be genotyped and arialyzed using GAPS<br />standardized microsatellite baseline for estimation of mixture proportions . Scale analysis and length<br />estimates will be used to provide auxiliary age information and will be available for cohort reconstruction.<br />Each genetics laboratory will be responsible for sending a database with genotypes and associated<br />sample information to Oregon State University (OSU) for compilation into a final database and genetic<br />mixture analysis. OSU will send the compiled database to Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife<br />(ODFW) for use in ageing analysis. OSU will provide ODFW with regional and individual population<br />assignments.<br />Objectives<br />&acirc; The performance period of the contract will be from July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009<br />&acirc; A report will be provided at the conclusion of the performance period<br />&acirc; Collect and analyze scales to provide auxiliary age estimates<br />&acirc; Compare stock mixtures proportions obtained from analysis of CWT recoveries to proportions<br />calculated from a GSI analysis on the total collection of genetic samples obtained from each<br />catch<br />&acirc; Compare stock proportions of legal to sub-legal fish encountered during onboard marine<br />recreational fisheries sampling in Washington<br />&acirc; For recreational fisheries, compare stock proportions of legal/sub-legal fish sampled by the<br />onboard observer program 9Washington side) to legal sized fish sampled dockside in Oregon<br />and Washington.</p>
<p>The Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) concluded a new Agreement in June of 1999 that established a<br />new abundance-based management approach to managing the Chinook fisheries subject to the Pacific<br />Salmon Treaty. The Abundance-Based Management Plan included assignments of new data collection<br />and analysis tasks to the Pacific Salmon Commission 's Chinook Technical Committee (CTC). The U.S.<br />Commissioners recommended to Congress that the funding required to carry out these tasks be provided<br />to state and tribal fishery managers . Congress appropriated $ 1.7 million dollars for this purpose to the<br />National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in FY 2008.<br />The U. S. Commissioners invited fishery management agencies , and tribal management groups to submit<br />proposals to review for funding that would provide new information required for Chinook salmon<br />abundance-based management. They also directed the USCTC to intensively review these proposals to<br />determine if they met the program needs and were technically sound.<br />Based on the USCTC review and recommendation , the Commissioners recommended a series of<br />proposals for funding , including a proposal from Oregon State University (OSU) to document the mixed<br />stock analysis of troll and marine sport Chinook fisheries from Cape Falcon North to Ledbetter Point using<br />GAPS standardized microsatellite genetic markers . This contract addresses item 5b of the December 5,<br />2006 request for proposals by the CTC; specifically the collection and analysis of mixed stock samples.<br />This information will improve escapement estimates to CTC standards and improve the data used in<br />analytical methods that support Chinook salmon abundance based management under the Pacific<br />Salmon Treaty.<br />The development of DNA stock separation techniques for Chinook salmon and the establishment of a<br />coast-wide Chinook Salmon DNA sample baseline have been undertaken by a consortium of laboratories<br />working in close coordination. It is necessary that the participation of these laboratories is maintained as<br />this work proceeds. Oregon State University has one of the eight labs that have been involved and Dr.<br />Michael Banks is a leading expert in this developing field. A sole source contract is justified due to their<br />special expertise and participation in the development and application of new genetic stock identification<br />techniques for Chinook salmon.<br />Based on the U.S. Commissioner's decisions and recommendation , OSU should be sole source<br />contractor for this project.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to solicit offers based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice, or issued a contract to Oregon State University without further notice.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters Division, Patuxent River, MD intends to award a contract modification to a sole-source firm-fixed price contract to Harris Corporation, Melbourne, FL, for the procurement and storage of an estimated 10,440 MicroSemi Transceivers (P/N S2060QSIAB) .  The items will deliver and ship in place at the contractor owned facility in Melbourne, FL.  The Air Combat Electronics Office (PMA 209) has a requirement to protect production and repair of the Fibre Channel Network Switch for capability of the Advanced Mission Computer & Displays (AMC&D) system, the mission system for the F/A-18 aircraft.  The MicroSemi Transceiver, a commercial component of the Fibre Channel Network Switch, is going obsolete.  Additional emergent requirements for the FCNS necessitate the procurement of an additional life of type buy for this component.  There are no other known parts that meet form, fit and function replacement requirements.  Harris is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the FCNS, as well as the designated repair facility and, as such, is the only source capable of procuring, managing and storing this part to protect production and life cycle support of the FCNS.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C 2304 (c ) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (Only on responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER to The Columbia Group, Inc., 1201 M. St. SE, Ste. 10, Washington, DC 20003-3703.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement to provide document generation and research involved with the upcoming Procurement Performance Management Assessment Program (PPMAP) on-site review as well as other policy support as required.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This effort is a follow on effort and the current contract is with the Columbia Group.  The Columbia Group employee currently providing this support is a former NAVSEA Policy Director and has many years of experience performing PPMAP reviews at various field activities.  The individual also has first hand knowledge of the review process and is in a unique position to assist with PPMAP review in order to help ensure a successful outcome.  If the follow-on effort is awarded to another source, it would result in substantial duplication of efforts and delays not likely to be recovered by competition and the risk of failure for not being ready for the review would be extremely high.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement

<a href="mailto:humphrey.nicole@epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 513111   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) in Washington, DC intends to award a Purchase Order to the Hispanic Radio Network, LLC, of Washington, DC, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, SimplifiedAcquisition Procedures.  
The purpose of this purchase order is to acquire contractor support to develop two (2) national radio campaigns.  The first campaign shall focus on the prevention of take-home pesticide exposure to farm worker children and families, and the second shall target farmworkers in Washington State who speak the indigenous language of Mixteco.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 513111.    NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   
It has been determined that the Hispanic Radio Network is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement as it is the only Spanish-speaking radio network with broad access to Spanish-speaking radio stations across the country.  HCN's 245 radio station affiliates cover 90% of the US Hispanic population - a reach not provided by any other radio network.  Since 83% of the farmworkers are Spanish speaking, HCN's unique and broad reaching ability into the Spanish speaking community is critical to achieving EPA's goals under this requirement.  Furthermore, Hispanic Communications Network has affiliates in many hard-to-reach rural communities where radio is one of the few sources of news and information relevant to migrant farmworkers.  Radio remains an important vehicle for reaching this low-literacy-level population.  
Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement, as stated herein, may submit their corporate capabilities, which if received by the response date of this announcement may be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to Nicole Humphrey, Contract Specialist at humphrey.nicole@epa.gov by 4:00PM EDT on the response date listed above.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A copy of this notice can also be found at: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/hisradio/index.htm.
All questions should be directed to Nicole Humphrey, Contract Specialist via e-mail at humphrey.nicole@epa.gov.

Title:  Ultrasonic Characterization of High Solid Content Suspensions
IPID:  14859-E

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture, and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  This acoustic-based sensor or process monitor characterizes suspensions or slurries having moderate and high particle concentrations that are found in a variety of industries. As the characteristics of the suspensions influence production costs, product quality and yield, it is useful to rapidly, cost-effectively, and non-invasively characterize these suspensions. Using an ultrasonic field, properties of a solid-liquid suspension such as through-transmission attenuation, backscattering, and diffuse field are measured with this novel technology. These properties are converted to quantities indicating the strength of different loss mechanisms (such as absorption, single scattering and multiple scattering) among particles in the suspension. Such separation of the loss mechanisms can allow for direct comparison of the attenuating effects of the mechanisms. These comparisons can also indicate a model most likely to accurately characterize the suspension and can aid in the determination of properties such as particle size, concentration, and density of the suspension. Advantages include (1) no need for dilution (less chance for error and less labor), (2) does not solely rely on attenuation (typical of commercial devices that are limited to use at low solid concentrations), (3) no clogging as commonly seen in small propagation path devices, and (4) avoids inaccuracies associated with transducer alignment.  A detailed description of the technology is provided in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008-0066551.  Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 60 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>US Army CECOM Life Cycle Management Command (CECOM LCMC) plans to award a contract modification for a ceiling increase to contract number W15P7T-05-D-J405 with DRS Tactical Systems, Inc located in Melbourne, Florida pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) One Responsible Source (Reference: Justification & Approval for Other Than Full & Open Competition Control Number 08-122). This action increases contract ordering ceiling by 297 computer systems. The ordering ceiling of Contract Number W15P7T-06-D-J405 will be reached sooner than anticipated due to a significant increase in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) requirements.  Therefore, an Acquisition Requirements Package (ARP) is currently in development for an additional increase of 60,000 systems which was synopsized on 24 May 2008, reference Solicitation Number W15P7T-07-R-J410.  However due to increase demand, an immediate ceiling increase is necessary to address the near term requirement of 297 systems needed to replace existing systems that provide Blue Force Tracking capabilities that are rapidly approaching the end of their useful life.  W15P7T-08-R-A605 is assigned to this action for reference purposes; there are no solicitation documents. POC for this acquisition is Contract Specialist Dana Newcomb 732-427-1542, email Dana.Newcomb@conus.army.mil or Contracting Officer Simone Lucy 732-427-1538, email Simone.Lucy@conus.army.mil.<BR>

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) provides many economic measurements as part of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs).  The NIPAs are used for a variety of purposes in setting national economic policy and in forecasting and interpreting macroeconomic activity.  They include gross domestic product (GDP), which is considered the most useful summary measure of the nation’s production, and related measures.  BEA, as one of the world’s leading statistical agencies, collects source data, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements estimation methodologies and disseminates statistics to the public.  

BEA is the nation’s economic accountant, producing measures such as GDP, national income, and corporate profits and related measures, which can have a substantial impact on financial markets.  Measures related to income include employer contributions for supplemental income, including contributions to pension and health plans.  Measures related to corporate profits include profits before tax, taxes on corporate income, profits after tax, net dividends, and undistributed profits (retained earnings).

The Bureau of the Census (BOC), on behalf of BEA, intends to enter into a contract with Standard & Poor’s of The McGraw-Hill Companies to provide services to collect (1) detailed annual company information on company employer contributions to supplemental income for the preparation of annual income estimates; and (2) detailed quarterly company information on corporate profits and related measures for the preparation of quarterly corporate profits estimates.  Quarterly updates of annual estimates of employer contributions to supplemental income are required and shall be in the form of continuous annual time series.  Weekly updates of quarterly corporate profits and related measures shall be provided and these data shall be in the form of continuous quarterly time series.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis shall use these data to develop and analyze income and related measures, corporate profits, corporate tax liabilities, dividends, and retained earnings.  

The Contractor shall meet the requirements by performing the following:

1.  Provide annual database with quarterly updates.  (The time period covered will be the first quarter through the fourth quarter for each year of the contract.)  
2.  Compile data from shareholders’ reports of public and actively traded companies in the United States.
3.  Provide the following detailed company data series for income and related measures:

     Employer contributions to pension plans;
     Employee contributions to pension plans;
     Liabilities of pension plans; and
     Employer contributions to health plans.

For profits-related measures:

1.  Provide quarterly database with weekly updates.  (The time period covered will be the first quarter through the fourth quarter for each year of the contract.) 
2.  Compile data from shareholders’ reports of public and actively traded companies in the United States.
3.  Provide the following detailed company data series for corporate profits and related measures:

     Sales;
     Profits before tax;
     Depreciation charges;
     Special charges; and
     Dividends.

Delivery of quarterly data shall not lag the referenced quarter by more than one quarter.

A second channel is required to receive the annual corporate financial data in ASCII format.  This service, this secondary means of accessing the data, supports NIWD analysts by facilitating conversion of the corporate financial data into FAME format.  The data is dynamically changing data set that is available upon signing in to the Standard and Poor's (S&P) website.  Immediately, upon receipt of corporate reports, the vendor shall upload the reports onto their website.  The vendor shall provide password access to the website to facilitate easy download of the data into ASCII format.  

The place of performance shall be at Standard & Poor’s in Centennial, CO.  The period of performance shall be for one year from date of award plus 4 one year option periods.  The government anticipates awarding a Fixed Price Contract using Part 15 Negotiated Competitive Procurement procedures.

<DESC>NASA/ARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for engineeringdesign and development of microsatellite deployment systems.Background:	NASA and the Small Satellite Division at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC)have recently teamed with industry and universities to develop fully automated, miniaturespaceflight systems.  Advanced miniaturization of key technologies coupled with theability to launch small, secondary spacecraft offers a new, low-cost way to advance spaceexploration technology. Putting novel cellular genetics investigative tools into smallspacecraft gives scientists a powerful ability to study and understand the effects ofdeep space environments on living things.  ARC has an existing purchase order withCalifornia State University at San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) to design and fabricate amicrosatellite deployer engineering development unit (EDU) prototype, the Poly PicoSatOrbital Deployer (PPOD).  The PPOD, developed by Cal Poly, will carry six small CubeSatmicrosatellites.  CubeSats are flight certified and have been used on various NASAmissions, including GeneSat.The objectives of this Request for Information (RFI) are to provide industry withpreliminary information regarding this potential acquisition, to determine otherpotential sources and industry capabilities, request cost/schedule estimates, and toinvite potential offerors to submit comments regarding the Government's acquisitionapproach. NASA has a requirement for engineering design and development of microsatellitedeployment systems.  These systems will be developed to deploy a quantity of CubeSatminiature satellites.  The deployment system will enable the integration of the NASA Amesmicrosatellite spacecraft to a variety of NASA-acquired launch vehicles.  The deploymentsystem will hold a number of miniature CubeSat satellites, and must be compatible withthe CubeSat specification.  NASA is aware of a number of CubeSat developers, academic aswell as commercial vendors, however few are NASA flight certified.  The vendor willprovide up to twenty miniature satellite deployment systems per year, with twodestructive engineering development units (EDUs) required by October 2008, and two flightcapable units required by December 2008.The CubeSat orbital microsatellite deployer has the following minimum requirements:1.

<SUBJECT>Monitoring Part C and Part D Data from Medicare Part C and Part D Sponsor Organizations
<SOLNBR>80144
<RESPDATE>052908

<DESC>Monitoring Part C and Part D Data from Medicare Part C and Part D Sponsor Organizations (Business Requirement, Reporting Tool and Analysis)


THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses on the GSA MOBIS Schedule (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that have the capability to analyze data from Medicare Part C and Part D sponsors (as well as having expert knowledge of  Medicare Part C and Part D benefits and payments); and the capability of developing business requirements for monitoring and reporting on risk adjustment, payment, and bid data.  

Background:
The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 established the Medicare+Choice Program or Medicare Part C and mandated the implementation of a risk adjustment methodology that accounts for variation in per capita costs based on health status.  BBA granted authority to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to collect inpatient hospital data for admissions occurring after July 1997.  These data were submitted by Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations (formerly Medicare+Choice (M+C)) and incorporated in the risk-adjusted component of managed care payments. The Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000 further required that CMS collect diagnosis data from ambulatory settings (physician and hospital outpatient) to be incorporated into risk-adjusted payments beginning in 2004.  

The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 established the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit for people with Medicare. The MMA expanded the role of private plans in providing benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. The law added a new section to the Social Security Act; 1860D (Part D) that offered partially governmental subsidized prescription benefits beginning in 2006 through private sector Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). Part D sponsors predominantly fall into two categories: stand-alone prescription drug contracts (PDPs), and Medicare Advantage health contracts that offer a prescription drug plan(s) (MA-PDs).  Secondly, the statute allowed for payments to MA “local plans” and created a new type of private plan, “regional” MA plans.  Finally, the legislation specified that beginning with the 2006 contract year organizations bidding for contracts or with contracts that offered PDPs and MA benefits must annually submit bids that support the actuarial basis of its pricing.  By statute, bids are due the first Monday in June of each year.

Purpose:
CMS is seeking to determine if there are small businesses capable of supporting CMS in implementing a data reporting system based on Part C and Part D data.  CMS is seeking assistance with analysis of Parts C and D bid and payment data from sponsors, and development of business requirements for automated reporting of these analyses in a CMS system.  A potential contractor shall be able to develop analytic approaches to examining these data based on contract and program benefit characteristics, and develop benchmark measures to which sponsor groups could be compared.  

Part C and Part D Bids
MA organizations must submit an aggregate monthly bid amount for each coordinated care plan, private fee-for-service, or Medicare Savings Account plan the organization intends to offer under Part C.  Each average bid represents the MA organization’s estimate of its average monthly required revenue to provide coverage in the service area of the plan for an MA eligible beneficiary with a nationally average risk profile.  Each bid is a uniform benefit package for the service area.  The bid shall contain all estimated required revenue, including administrative costs and return on investment (profit, retained earnings).  

Part D sponsors must submit an aggregate monthly bid amount for each prescription drug plan (PD or PDP) the organization intends to offer under Medicare Part D.  Each Part D bid must reflect a uniform benefit package, including premium (except as provided for the late enrollment penalty described in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 42 § 423.286(d)(3)) and all applicable cost sharing, for all individuals enrolled in the plan.  Each bid must reflect the sponsor’s estimate of its average monthly revenue requirements to provide qualified prescription drug coverage (including supplemental coverage) for a Part D eligible individual with a national average risk profile.  

Part C and Part D Payments
CFR 42 § 422.300 sets forth the rules for making payments to MA organizations offering local and regional MA plans, including calculation of MA capitation rates and benchmarks, conditions under which payment is based on plan bids, adjustments to capitation rates (including risk adjustment), and other payment rules.  CFR 42 § 423.301 sets forth rules for the calculation of and payments to Part D sponsor for direct (risk adjustment) and reinsurance subsidies; risk corridor and risk sharing application; and retroactive adjustments and reconciliations to actual enrollment and interim payments.
       
Payments to Part C sponsors and direct subsidy payments to Part D sponsors are risk adjusted based the health status of the enrolled populations. Part C sponsors that offer Part D (typically MA-PDs) are required by CMS to submit health status data for their Part C and Part D enrollees.  For Part C payments and Part D direct subsidy, CMS pays plans a capitated amount for each of its members.  CMS uses two independent prospective risk adjustment models to assign risk scores to be incorporated into capitated payments to Part C and Part D sponsors.  Risk adjusted payments are based on predictive costs associated with providing health service and/or prescription drug benefits to Medicare beneficiaries based on their health status.  The CMS hierarchical condition category (CMS-HCC) model calculates beneficiary risk scores based on the predicted cost for health services. The Prescription Drug HCC (RxHCC) model calculates beneficiary risk scores based on the predicted drug cost. In total, both models use approximately 6,600 chronic disease categories as assigned based on the International Classification of Disease 9th Revision (ICD-9).  CMS requires MA organizations to submit relevant Part C and Part D diagnosis data for beneficiaries who are enrolled in their plan.  Stand-alone PDPs are not required to submit risk adjustment data, and therefore the direct subsidy payments for their Part D enrollees are based on fee-for-service claims data and/or data submitted from MA organizations.   

Task Descriptions:
The tasks under this potential action will focus on conducting analyses of Part C and Part D bids and payments, and developing comprehensive business requirements for routine reporting of these data.  

The contractor shall be able to provide and incorporate the following technical and analytic approaches: 

(1) Design statistical approaches to summarize monthly Part C and Part D risk scores and payments, and prepare analyses by contract/Plan Benefit Package (PBP), Special Need Plans (SNPs), Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS), PDPs and other Part C and D analyses requested by CMS.  Research and identify differences payment differences associated with Part C and/or Part D benefit types and organizations types.  Conduct MA to Fee-for-Service (FFS) comparative analyses.

(2) Analyze Part C and Part D bids submitted by sponsors and prepare databases for CMS, including large files with numerous variables, and prepare special analyses on contract types, SNPs, PFFS plans, PDPs, geographic areas, and other Part C and D analyses requested by CMS (e.g., MA versus FFS, cost sharing classifications, rebates, etc).  Research and identify differences in bids that are associated with Part C and/or Part D benefit types and organization types. 

(3) Identify and research Part C and D operation and policy issues related to data outcomes.

(4) Develop benchmarks to which Part C and Part D sponsored could be compared and outlier organizations could be identified.  This includes conducting on-going analysis to update the benchmarks as relating to the specific Part C and Part D bid and payment periods. 

(5) Develop sound framework to model changes in risk scores that could be explained by plan attributes, the risk adjustment model parameters and risk adjustment diagnosis data submissions, etc; thus identifying primary indicators of problematic payments for future data monitoring efforts. 

(6) Write business requirements for integrating Part C and D bid and payment data into a CMS data reporting system. The business requirements must also provide detail for building automated analytic summary measures into the tool.  The data reporting system must incorporate a method for establishing benchmarks as defined under previous tasks.

(7) Test and validate system requirements for the reporting tool. This will include working with other CMS contractors to evaluate the requirements for the system that will be used for analyzing the annual bids and monthly payments for Part C and D sponsors.  

(8) Develop and implement coordinated efforts with CMS and its contractors to provide technical assistance and communication to problematic plans.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses on the GSA MOBIS Schedule (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide assistance in the development of audit and compliance tools and policy for the Medicare Advantage (MA), Prescription Drug, Employer/Union Sponsored Group Health Plan, Program of All Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) and Cost Based Programs as well as performing both routine and focused program compliance audits of these organizations.  

History:  

In December 2003, the President signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA).  MMA expanded the role of private plans in providing benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. The law added a new section to the Social Security Act (SSA); 1860D (Part D) that offered prescription benefits beginning in 2006 through Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). Secondly, the statute allowed for payments to MA “local plans” (formerly Medicare Plus Choice (M+C) plans) and created a new type of private plan, “regional” MA plans (RPPOs).  PACE became a permanent program under the Balanced Budget Act of 1999 (PubLNo 105-33) and a state option for the Medicaid program.  PACE was created to help community-based organizations provide health and long-term care services on a capitated basis to frail elderly persons at risk of being institutionalized.

CMS has statutory authority to waive or modify requirements that hinder the design of, the offering of, or the enrollment in, employer/union sponsored MA plans and standalone PDPs.  The statutory authority, set forth in Section 1857(i) of the SSA applies to MA plans.  The statutory authority set forth in Section 1860D-22(b) of the Social Security Act applies to PDPs.  Under this specific statutory authority, in order to facilitate the offering of MA plans and PDPs to employer/union group health plan sponsors, CMS may grant waivers and/or modifications to MA Organizations (MAOs) and PDP Sponsors.

Under Section 1876 and 1833(a)(1)(A) of the SSA, a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) or Competitive Medical Plan (CMP) is allowed to participate in the Medicare program by receiving “reasonable cost” reimbursement for furnishing coverer services to enrolled beneficiaries.  1833 Cost Plans [or Heath Care Prepayment Plans (HCPP)] must either be union or employer sponsored or must not provide inpatient hospital services for its enrollees.  Payments are made to these plans on a per capita basis each month and adjusted up or down to the level of incurred costs during the contract year.  Both 1876 and 1833 (HCPP) need to undergo monitoring audits to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Oversight of Medicare Health & Drug Plan Organizations

CMS is responsible for providing oversight of the types of organizations listed above.  CMS's oversight of plans and drug sponsors is a monitoring control designed to ensure they are in compliance with regulations established within applicable Medicare law, and therefore eligible to participate in the Medicare program.  

CMS has ten Regional Offices, as well as an existing audit contractor that performs the program compliance audits. Upon the completion of the audit, CMS is required to communicate noncompliances identified to the organizations, which are then required to submit corrective action plans. CMS Management is required to evaluate the corrective action plans in order to make a final determination of each plan's eligibility.

CMS has the responsibility to:  

•	build and maintain an auditing and oversight infrastructure to properly oversee these programs
•	ensure program compliance audit findings, corrective action plans (CAPS), and acceptance of the provider's corrective action plans are provided, reviewed, and released within the proposed time frames 
•	ensure that relevant data are updated timely in order to provide the information necessary for adequate management oversight.

Oversight System

The Health Plan Management System (HPMS) is used by CMS to monitor the execution and status of plan/sponsor oversight, and to serve as a repository to the various audit elements utilized during this review process. This system lies at the core of CMS's management process for MAOs.  The Monitoring Review Module in HPMS enables management to monitor the MAOs by tracking the progress of the program compliance audits.  Results are updated, including exceptions, corrective action plans, and CMS’s acceptance of CAPS from MAO’s.

Purpose:

The purpose of this potential action is to support CMS through: 

&#61607;	statute and regulatory analysis and review of CMS sub-regulatory guidance; 
&#61607;	audit guide, standard operating procedures and worksheet development and training; 
&#61607;	program manual development; and,
&#61607;	plan enforcement activity support.  

When necessary, the contractor will also perform oversight and auditing activities of Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs), Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs), Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plans (MA-PDs), Employer/Union-Only Group Waiver Plans (EGWPs) and Programs of the All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) plans, in addition to Medicare Cost-based plans together labeled “plans” for the Medicare programs.  In addition, the Contractor will provide technical assistance to CMS Regional Offices, Health Plans and Sponsors.  CMS currently contracts with approximately 800 plans and plan sponsors and will provide the contractor with an audit schedule.

Performance on this potential action for Part C, Cost Plan and PACE audits may require some on-site visits to plans.  However, CMS will attempt to limit the need for on-site visits as much as possible.  CMS estimates the contractor will audit at least 40 different organizations during the period of performance

Task Descriptions:  

The tasks under this potential action will focus on the development, management, performance and quality of the compliance audit and oversight program performed by CMS.  Given the timeframe of the work to be accomplished, these tasks will need to be carried out simultaneously.  In addition, tasks may require that policy guides and audits be conducted concurrently.  The multiple tasks being performed simultaneously will require a contractor to have several groups of staff available at the same time.  

CMS intends for the tasks to be done in a collaborative effort between CMS and the contractor.  A close working relationship between the contractor and CMS throughout all aspects of this potential action is expected.  

CMS anticipates the contractor will audit at least 20 different contracted organizations within one year, as well as develop a fully up-to-date audit protocol within a 90-day period.  The contractor will have to ensure the audits are performed timely and according to CMS Standard Operating Procedures and Audit Guides.  The tasks will include the following:

1.	Perform policy and regulatory analysis to further develop auditing tools and elements.
2.	Assist CMS in the development, revision, testing, and training of all audit elements and worksheets, standard operating procedures, detailed business processes, and data-driven performance assessment tools for all programs including but not limited to: Part C, Part D, PACE, MSA, EGWP, and Cost Plans.
3.	Perform data analysis and reporting of audit findings stored in CMS internal systems, and based on such analysis, develop plan risk assessments utilizing a data driven approach.
4.	Perform Routine, Focused, and Ad-Hoc Plan Audits as well as Validation Surveys and ‘look-behind’ reviews utilizing appropriate staff with the required experience (e.g.: pharmacists, managed care specialists, nurses) according to CMS audit strategy or on an as needed basis.
5.	Ensure that existing policies and procedures for the monitoring of organizations within the Medicare program are consistently applied and that audits performed are documented in accordance with appropriate standards and guidelines.
6.	Meet with CMS to review the results and progress of all tasks and provide detailed reports that summarize accomplishments to date.

No solicitation is available at this time. Based on capability statements received in response to this sources sought announcement this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set-aside.  All small business organizations (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZONE, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice.  Small business organizations must have their size status certified by the small business administration.  All small businesses are encouraged to respond. The NAICS code is 519190 with a size standard of $6.5M.
On July 19, 2007, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT), American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) co-organized a one-day workshop entitled Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy. More than 20 professional societies and organizations sent representatives to this meeting. The purpose of the workshop was to discuss the potential value of clinical guidelines to be generated with input from a broad range of health care providers who diagnose and treat patients with food allergies and diseases related to food allergy such as atopic dermatitis, asthma and eosinophilic esophagitis. The workshop participants concluded that a significant need exists for guidelines that could be used in a variety of clinical and health care settings.The NIAID plans to use a report based on a systematic literature review, in conjunction with consensus expert opinion, to develop clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy. Drafting of the guidelines will be performed by an independent Food Allergy Guidelines Expert Panel.The Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation Research Contract Branch (AIT RCB), NIAID Office of Acquisitions is seeking capability statements from small business organizations with the technical expertise to review the scientific and clinical literature on food allergy.  The Contractor will perform a systematic literature review, evaluate, and grade the data.  The Contractor will also produce an interim and a final evidence-based literature review report summarizing the results of the systematic literature review of food allergy, including knowledge gaps and areas in which consensus has not been reached.  Capability statements shall address the following tasks, and examples of previous experience with similar work should be provided as part of the capability statement:  
NIAID/CONTRACTOR COMMUNICATION:  Provide periodic progress reports and immediate and continued open communication with the NIAID Project and Contract Officers following award of the contract.SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW AND EVIDENCE GRADING:  Design and perform a full systematic literature review of primary literature (and in some cases, quality review articles) describing the state of the science in food allergy.  The review and analysis shall address all topics/questions outlined by the NIAID in the Request for Quotes (RFQ).  Examples of these topics/questions include defining food allergy, and describing the prevalence, natural history, diagnosis, and management of food allergy, including the diagnosis and treatment of acute food allergic reactions.  DRAFT REPORT CONTAINING THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW:  Prepare a draft of the final report, to be completed 6-8 months after the award of the contract, which shall be used as reference material by the Food Allergy Guidelines Expert Panel. FINAL REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW:  The final report describing the results of the systematic literature review will require the Contractor to assemble all extracted evidence into a comprehensive report on the state of the science in food allergy.  The final report shall address the topics and questions outlined by the NIAID in the RFQ.  The Contractor shall incorporate any editorial comments or changes suggested by the NIAID into the final report.  CONSULTING FOR THE FOOD ALLERGY GUIDELINES EXPERT PANEL: Designate 1-2 representatives to attend approximately 3 meetings of the Food Allergy Guidelines Expert Panel to summarize the methods and findings of the systematic review and final report.
The Government anticipates making a single award.  It is anticipated that the duration of the contract will be a maximum three (3) years; however, the length of time for which funds is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  Capability statements submitted as a result of this announcement should demonstrate the offerors qualifications and experience, specifically providing evidence as to their capability to perform this requirement.

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-3 provided at: http://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/52_215.html#wp1144503. <br />No solicitation document exists at this time. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation. In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) is a government research installation on the Forrestal Campus of Princeton University. GFDL was founded in 1955 by Joseph Smagorinsky on the premise that if he had a large enough computing system he could forecast the weather at least 24 hours in advance. Smagorinsky originally set up the Lab in Washington, DC. The Lab grew and eventually found the need to become affiliated with a university partner in order to recruit and train the highest caliber researchers in this field. In 1968, GFDL relocated to its current location. In 1980, GFDL exceeded the physical constraints of its facility and so it constructed what is known as the computer addition, which includes a 10,000-square-foot computer room, and is connected to the Main Building by way of two connecting corridors.</p>
<p>GFDL scientists study the Earth's climate and weather systems. Information about the work of the lab is provided at http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov. GFDL scientists conduct scientific experiments by numerically modeling the Earth's physical processes and using a high performance computing system (known generally as a supercomputer) to build and run those models and to evaluate the model results.</p>
<p>POWER DEMANDS<br />GFDL is in the final stages of transitioning to the mid-life upgrade configuration to its installed computer system. The power demand of the previous system was 860 kW, and the power demand of the new mid-life system will be 1030 kW. The computer is operated 24 hours per day every day of the year, so this is a sustained power demand. The power that the computer consumes is converted directly to heat which must be managed as well. GFDL has a 1000-ton chilled water plant in a three-chiller N+1 configuration that is used to supply 42o F chilled water to 13 computer room air conditioners as well as for comfort cooling for the entire facility. The array of computer room air conditioners provides about 400 tons of heat exchange capacity within the computer room in an N+1 configuration. GFDL's former total site power demand was sustained within the 1400-1600 kW range with some periods at a higher level (typically on the hottest, most humid days of the year due to chiller and cooling tower inefficiencies on such days) and even fewer periods with less demand (when equipment was down for maintenance). GFDL projects that the sustained total site power demand following completion of the mid-life upgrade will be in the 1600-1800 kW range.</p>
<p>GFDL's current power feed from its electric utility, Public Service Gas and Electric (PSE&amp;G), is terminated into a 3.75 MW, 13.2 kV to 4.16 kV transformer. This power feed is shared between GFDL and some of the other buildings on the Forrestal Campus. The share of the peak load for the other buildings on campus is about 750 kW. GFDL's historical peak demand is 1,944 kW which occurred in August 2007. Due to the increased compute load that is being added with the mid-life installation, the lab expects to increase its peak demand to about 2300 kW on the hottest, most humid days of the summer through September 30, 2009. Ever growing demands on NOAA's climate modeling research programs will require a substantial increase in the computational power for the GFDL computer system, beginning in Fiscal Year 2010. The most likely scenario is that the total power needed to operate and cool the GFDL computer system in 2010 will be 3.5 MW. The existing residual building load is expected to remain unchanged. See summary tables in RFI Attachment at the section "GFDL Electric Billing Summary."<br /><br />HYDROGEN FUEL CELL AND WASTE HEAT UTILIZATION APPLICATION<br />GFDL is currently researching the possibility of a hydrogen fuel cell and waste heat utilization system to supply power for its critical compute load and to install a sophisticated chiller configuration to utilize the waste heat generated by the system to provide chilled water to cool the facility year round and to heat the facility in the winter. (GFDL currently has two natural-gas-fired Hurst Boilers rated at about 2,000,000 BTU each that provide heating for the facility. See summary tables in RFI Attachment at the section "GFDL Gas Billing Summary.")</p>
<p>The lab is interested in exploring the financing, engineering, and technical options involved with installing such a hydrogen fuel cell and waste heat utilization system, including all available financing incentives, including federal and state tax credits as well as "green" initiative incentives. Because the lab is located in the state of New Jersey, there are likely to be incentives through the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, http://www.njcleanenergy.com/renewable-energy/programs/clean-energy-financing/clean-energy-financing-and-assistance-programs.</p>
<p>The solution that GFDL seeks is one that is considered "end-to-end" or "turn-key" - in other words, the system would be designed and engineered, both financially and technically, to include the hardware purchase, installation (including architectural and engineering design services, permitting, construction - mechanical, electrical, structural, plumbing, and landscaping - and controls), and system maintenance. GFDL envisions a fuel cell and waste heat utilization solution that: powers its compute load; provides and powers a new chiller configuration that utilizes the waste heat to provide cooling for the computer; and ties the surplus waste heat not needed for cooling into the existing building heating system. The hydrogen fuel cell and waste heat utilization system that is envisioned would include various switching mechanisms to enable the lab to safely maintain each of the system components and would transfer its critical load and process cooling to the grid in the event of system maintenance or failure.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY CONSERVATION MEASURES<br />(1) Variable Speed Drives (VSDs) on Chiller 1 (400-ton centrifugal) and Chiller 3 (350-ton centrifugal) [Chiller 4 is a 250-ton screw-type machine and "Chiller 2" was decommissioned in the 1980's.]<br />(2) Variable Speed Drives on Towers 1A and 1B and Tower 4 (Tower 3 already has a VSD)<br />(3) Variable Speed Drives on the three Main Building Air Circulation Units and the Return Air Unit<br />(4) Variable Speed Drive on the Computer Building Air Circulation Unit.<br />(5) High efficiency lighting for the Main Building 3rd floor and for the Computer Building offices (GFDL will replace the lighting on the 1st and 2nd floor of the Main Building with high efficiency lighting as part of its current Asbestos Abatement Project. GFDL previously installed high efficiency lighting in the Computer Room)<br />(6) Film tint or otherwise screen the Main Building windows to reduce the Solar heat load</p>
<p>DOC/NOAA anticipates awarding a contract or entering into an agreement in Fiscal Year 2009 with the primary focus of conserving energy and providing a reliable off-grid power solution. We are interested in learning about authorized financing alternatives and tax rebates that could provide DOC/NOAA with flexibility to approach an energy savings project. Our anticipated budget increase for this effort in Fiscal Year 2009 is approximately $200,000.00.</p>
<p>DOC/NOAA requests your response to each of the following:<br />1. Describe your company's capability to provide a technologically-available and reliable hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) and waste heat utilization solution to address GFDL's current and anticipated mission critical data center energy and cooling requirements.<br />a. Describe your experience in installing a new HFC system;<br />b. Describe your experience in maintaining an HFC system:<br />c. Describe your experience in installing a new waste heat utilization system for the dual purpose of producing chilled water and heating a building;<br />d.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI).  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking sources to develop a replacement system for the existing mainframe Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) AN/USM-636 (V) test stations with a next generation test station solution, herein referred to as electronic Consolidated Automated Support System (eCASS).

General Description:  CASS is a common family of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) for automated avionics/electronics testing at Navy Intermediate Level maintenance and Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) sites both shore-based and afloat.  Legacy CASS systems are approaching the end of their useful service life and will be replaced with eCASS.  With the replacement of legacy mainframe CASS, reutilization of approximately 1300 existing CASS Test Program Sets (TPSs) is required on eCASS while maintaining or improving fidelity of test, run-times and performance.  The offeror will be responsible for any TPS software processes and related tools required for CASS TPS migration to eCASS.  The new test station shall have a compatibility mode that will emulate existing CASS station characteristics in order to maintain legacy CASS TPS performance and an eCASS mode that permits taking advantage of the full range of eCASS station capabilities.  The program will include delivery of an eCASS TPS developer’s toolset, a CASS to eCASS TPS conversion toolset, and an eCASS to RTCASS conversion toolset.

eCASS will consist of two configurations.  The first configuration, simply called eCASS, will be designed to assume TPS hosting of all CASS Hybrid, Radio Frequency (RF), High Power (HP), and Communication Navigation Interrogation (CNI) supported TPSs while reutilizing the GFE High Power Device Test Set (HPDTS) and GFE CNI Ancillary Set (CNIAS) assets.  The second configuration, called eCASS Electro-Optic (EO), will be a logistically common subset of the eCASS configuration that will be designed to assume TPS hosting of CASS EO TPSs (with only the functionality necessary to execute all associated EO TPSs) while reutilizing the GFE CASS EO console asset.  Existing and new CASS ancillary equipment shall be used with the eCASS stations to meet the full range of testing currently performed on all mainframe CASS station configurations.  eCASS shall be designed for shipboard and shore-based use, and shall be compliant with the eCASS specification and all other applicable documentation.

The Government is defining its acquisition strategy to operationally field eCASS test stations to the warfighter to replace existing mainframe CASS stations starting no later than FY15.  A draft RFP is anticipated for issuance on or about 16 June 2008 with a formal RFP to follow on or about 28 July 2008.  Anticipated contract award will occur in March 2009.  The contract type is anticipated to be Cost Plus Incentive Fee with Fixed Price Incentive options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) I and LRIP II deliveries during the final two years of the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract.  Based on our current understanding of industry capabilities, a five-year SDD phase is projected to include qualification testing followed by LRIP deliveries.  The anticipated quantities for the basic contract will include the efforts to design, test and produce six (6) Engineering Development Models (EDMs) to support Milestone C Decision in April 2012; and eight (8) EDMs to support Full Rate Production Decision in September 2013.  Also required are EDM SMAT/CAL ID Kits with Calibration Equipment; two (2) TPS development suites; four (4) CASS Qualification Test OTPS; technical and logistical data; training; and up to 20,000 hours of annual engineering and logistics services to support eCASS.  The contract will contain options to provide LRIP quantities of up to five (5) LRIP I systems NLT FY12 and up to nineteen (19) LRIP II systems NLT FY13; a technical data package; LRIP SMAT/CAL ID Kits; LRIP Calibration Kits; LRIP Install Kits; Repair of Repairables (ROR) Services; Spares; LRIP TPS developer suites; an eCASS Qualification Test OTPS, Installation Services; and On-Site Verifications (OSVs).  The Navy plans to separately award a follow-on contract, on a sole-source basis, to the successful offeror of this full and open competition, for the remaining production quantities of approximately three hundred forty-four (344) eCASS and eCASS EO stations with quantities ranging from between 50 and 65 per year for six years from FY14 to FY19.  Of the 344 systems, it is anticipated that approximately 279 will be the eCASS configuration and approximately 65 will be the eCASS EO configuration.

Respondents are requested to provide comments and/or suggestions for consideration, and indicate errors or omissions found on the draft eCASS Specification, Statement of Work (SOW), Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs) and associated attachments.  The Government will not share any information received with any other party outside the Government with the exception of those Government Contractor Support Services (CSS) personnel exclusively supporting the eCASS program and bound by Non-Disclosure Agreements on file with the Government.  Feedback will not be provided to any offerors and the Government PCO, at his sole discretion, may or may not incorporate suggestions into the final RFP package.  Request submittal of written responses to this RFI no later than 13 June 2008.

The draft eCASS Specification will be made available to potential respondents of the RFI upon request to Ms. Marybeth Kacek.  Due to the eCASS Specification being an Export Controlled document, it is not posted herein and is only available via such written request.  All requests for copies of this specification must contain a certified copy of a DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.

<DESC>1.  Robotics Systems.  The Project Manager, Robotics Systems Joint Project Office (RS JPO) located at the United States Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command (LCMC) in Warren, Michigan is seeking to identify sources capable of manufacturing a MV-4B Mechanical Anti-Personnel Mine Clearing System.  The MV-4B is a 7 ton tracked, combat engineer vehicle teleoperated light flail system, that can either neutralize antipersonnel (AP) mines by destroying or detonating them with its rotating flair head. The MV-4B can be teleoperated from within the blast protected Medium Mine Protected Vehicle (MMPV) or from a safe dismounted location.  It will neutralize antipersonnel and antitank (AT) mine blasts.  The MV-4B is capable of being sling loaded by joint and Army heavy rotary wing helicopters.  The MV-4B will neutralize non-hardened, simple pressure mines in designated areas.  The unmanned, teleoperated systems will keep Soldiers out of harms way by providing safe standoff distances.  The hand held, stand off remote control feature of the system allows the operator to remain outside the range of exploding mines during the clearing process, while machines engine and vital components are protected by steel armor plates against mine explosion fragments. The MV-4B will neutralize antipersonnel land mines in marked areas.

<CONTACT>Sandra L Aman, Contracting Officer, Phone 910-432-2146, Fax 910-432-9345, Email amans@soc.mil
<DESC>The United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) is soliciting interest and capability statements for a competitive acquisition to establish a color and black and white network printer standard within the command.  Once selected, the standard will be in place for approximately 5-10 years.  The Command currently has over 1,300 black and white and 600 color networked printers.  Our goal is to sustain a lifecycle program replacing approximately 25 percent of the devices annually. 

This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  It is not the intention of the Government to enter into a contract based on this notice or to otherwise pay for information solicited.   Once the standard is identified and selected, all USASOC printer purchases will be solicited competitively as brand name requests identifying the brand selected based on the information provided in this notice.

In preparation for developing the USASOC printer standard, the government is requesting input from vendors interested in having their printers evaluated and considered as the new printer standard for USASOC units.  

An initial paper review will be performed to pick the best two or three printers, based on established criteria in each category, e.g. color and black and white.  Those companies will then be contacted to participate in a pilot evaluation environment where they will be asked to provide their equipment for a 30-day testing phase.  The equipment provided shall be at no cost to the government, and will be returned once testing is completed.  After conclusion of the evaluation a printer or printers will be selected, resulting in a 5 to 10 year program to utilize the selected models for all life-cycle replacements.   

Focusing on basic requirements identified below for color and black and white networked printers, the Government requests solution proposals to meet or exceed each of the categories.  A printer evaluation criteria document is also provided identifying those areas to be considered during the evaluation process.

<DESC><p>15 May 08 - Advance Notice to Industry of Near Future RFI
<p>Aeronautical Systems Center, Capabilities Integration Directorate (ASC/XR) wishes to give advance notice of an anticipated request for information announcement to gather information on system concepts for a Next Generation Unmanned Aerial System (NG UAS). Specifics on submittal date, time and location and content will be provided in the RFI announcement anticipated end-May 2008. Industry will be requested to provide inputs to the NG UAS concept, system, missions, and key features described in paragraph A) - D) below by mid-July 2008.</p>
<p>A. The Air Force Material Command (AFMC) in support of the Air Combat Command (ACC) is interested in reviewing concepts for a NG UAS. The capability to detect, track, and precisely engage Time Sensitive Targets (TSTs) has been acknowledged as a highly important military need in the current war on terror. The MQ-1 Predator has proven to be a versatile system: an unmanned, remotely piloted air vehicle able to carry a variety of weapons to prosecute ground targets. The need for greater speed, range, altitude, and payload has led to the latest version, the MQ-9 Reaper. Even with incremental improvements, however, specialized and demanding hunt and kill missions with support of troops on the ground push the MQ-9s beyond the limits of its capabilities and present serious effectiveness issues. This leaves room for significant improvement and innovation in system performance needed to address future advisory threats that will exist in 2015 and beyond timeframe.</p>
<p>B. The NG UAS is envisioned to be a synergistic system consisting of an airframe, mission control station, sensor suite, and weapon suite. Integrated system solutions that can achieve capabilities much greater than current MQ-9's while being supportable and remaining relatively affordable are of interest. Initial system concepts should include proven and emerging technologies with an anticipated TRL of 6 by 2010 for anticipated IOC of 2015. The next generation system should provide significantly enhanced capability in the following areas:<br />&bull; Greatly reduced target prosecution timelines in increased assuredness of information for TST/Weapons of Mass Destruction and other high value targets<br />&bull; Enhanced survivability in increased threat environments including jamming, and chemical and biological.<br />&bull; Enhanced ISR with wider area persistent, all-weather multi-spectrum sensors, increased situational awareness<br />&bull; Automation for reduced manpower tasking with the intent to provide increased situational awareness<br />&bull; Integrated and multi-level secure sensor and communication network<br />&bull; Multi-role reconfigurable mission control station providing maximum situation awareness from sensors<br />&bull; Mission adaptable modular payload allowing various ISR/killer system configurations for maximum flexibility in single or multi-ship operations</p>
<p>C. Key missions the NG UAS should be capable of performing/supporting:</p>
<p>&bull; Limited Interdiction (all low and some med threat environments) <br />&bull; Close Air Support / Forward Air Control - Airborne (all low and some med threat environments) <br />&bull; Combat Search and Rescue Support (all low and some med threat environments) <br />&bull; Limited Suppression of Enemy Aircraft Defenses (all low and some med threat environments) <br />&bull; Joint Maritime Operations Support (all low and some med threat environments) <br />&bull; ISR (all low and some med threat environments) <br />&bull; Force Protection (identifying, and neutralizing threats such as IEDs, mortar tubes, and rocket sites)</p>
<p>D. Key features of interest for the NG UAS:</p>
<p>&bull; Affordable, reliable and supportable air vehicle with improved maneuverability and time on station than current MQ-1 and MQ-9 platforms<br />&bull; High subsonic dash speed<br />&bull; Ability to maintain operations and support in extreme climatic environments and adverse weather conditions <br />&bull; Ability to maintain operations in GPS/SATCOM jammed/spoofed airspace<br />&bull; Reduced susceptibility in low to medium threat environments<br />&bull; Self-deployable<br />&bull; Modular, adaptable, and upgradeable vehicle architecture integrated with modular, adaptable, and upgradeable mission control station architecture for multi-mission capability either in single or multiple ship formation<br />&bull; Mission Specific Tailoring - Adaptable system (sensors, payload, C2)<br />&bull; Improved payload capacity (up to twice as much) over the current MQ-9 <br />&bull; Internal and external carriage of weapons and sensors<br />&bull; Weapons payload of mixed/modular weapons capable of precise and scalable weapon effects<br />&bull; Modular sensor suite<br />&bull; Fleet Compatible - Sense &amp; Avoid, Terminal Area Operations, Airspace Management, Net Centricity and Interoperability (i.e. TCDL or equiv.)<br />&bull; Adaptable for long term component development (upgradeable, spirals)<br />&bull; Supportable by existing Air Force logistics infrastructure</p>
<p>E. The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. No solicitation documents exist at this time. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid or a Request for Proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this advertisement. This is a request for information/market research announcement for planning purposes. The Government will not reimburse costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

<a href="mailto:james.lovett@srs.gov">James Lovett, Contract Officer</a>
<DESC>The United States Department of Energy (DOE) intends to extend thecurrentmanagement and operating (M&O) contract with Washington Savannah RiverCompany(WSRC), LLC at the Savannah River Site (SRS) for a six month period withthreeone month option periods.  The present contract with WSRC ends on June 30,2008.  This proposed extension will enable DOE to continue criticalmissions atSRS during the evaluation and award of the Liquid Waste competitiveacquisition.  In addition, it will accommodate the ongoing M&O contracttransition that will end July 31, 2008.DOE already has awarded a successor M&O contract at SRS.  However, thescope ofthe successor M&O contract does not encompass all the requirements of thecurrent WSRC M&O contract, including requirements for treatment anddisposal ofLiquid Waste. While DOE currently is competing a contract for treatment anddisposal of Liquid Waste at SRS, that contract is not expected to beawardedbefore expiration of the WSRC contract.  Therefore, this proposed extensionisnecessary to continue performance of residual requirements not included inthesuccessor M&O contract, including Liquid Waste treatment and disposalrequirements, until a new contract is awarded and transition is complete.DOEintends to extend the existing contract with WSRC effective July 1, 2008through December 31, 2008, with possible additional extensions (if needed)through March 31, 2009.The proposed extension is based upon the exclusion found at FederalAcquisitionRegulation 6.302-1 and 41 United States Code 253(c)(1), which authorizesotherthan full and open competition when there is only one responsible sourceand noother supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within thelimitedtime frame.  To DOEs knowledge, only WSRC has the requisite knowledge,experience and capability to provide these critical, highly specializedservices without interruption during the acquisition cycle for a newcontract.THERE ARE NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE FOR THIS REQUIREMENT.Interested, responsible sources may submit information about theircapabilityto perform this requirement, which shall be considered by DOE for thepurposeof determining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition fortheseinterim services.  Responses to this synopsis must be received via theDOEsIndustry Interactive Procurement System by May 30, 2008 to be considered.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with the Society of Primary Care Policy Fellows (SPCPF), on a sole source basis, to help organize, promote, and run ten seminars consisting of moderated discussion with one or two national leaders in primary care on timely issues facing primary care.  The sessions will be open to all individuals and organizations interested in the future of primary care, including federal legislative and administrative policy makers, as well as state and local policy makers, consumer advocacy organizations, the business community, clinicians, academics, and community members.  The basis for restricting competition is the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by the FAR Part 6.302-1 because only one source is available to provide the service in a manner that will satisfy agency requirements.  The anticipated contract period will be for approximately 15 months from the date of award.


As part of its commitment to improving the health of all Americans through improved quality and availability of primary health care, the Centre for Primary Care, Prevention & Clinical Partnerships of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) intends to:


1.	Inform those involved and interested in health care policy about current issues in primary health care through interactive educational sessions.
2.	Highlight the multiple benefits and challenges of primary health care so that these issues are included in discussions of national health care policy.
3.	Provide a venue for those interested in the future of primary health care to meet, share idea, and network.


The Society of Primary Care Policy Fellows can be considered the only responsible source due to their unique position in the primary care field.  SPCPF is the only organization with over 20 years of strong collaborative working relationships with primary care medical, nursing, dental, pharmacy, and mental health professional organizations.  This type of experience is needed in order to attract meaningful participation from a wide variety of stakeholders, as well as, command respect from the full range of primary care professional organizations.
 

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as articulated above.  Any interested source, in order to meet the requirements will need to demonstrate and address in their capability statement (1) a strong working relationship with primary care organizations (2) extensive experience working with primary care organizations.  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted by 5 pm May 27, 2008 to the point of contact listed in this announcement.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), on behalf of the US Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) and the Special Operations Command (SOCOM), has a requirement for a small, lightweight battery for use with the Enginivity enFlow IV fluid warmer. USAMRAA intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Enginivity. The intent is to make a sole source award pursuant to FAR 6.302(a)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and FAR 6.302(a)(2)(ii), supplies are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. Enginivity has been working with the Government since 2005 to develop a portable fluid warmer that can be operated using alternating current (AC) power or from battery power at flow rates suitable for trauma care. The company has produced commercial FDA-cleared fluid warmers for civilian and military applications and is using a commercial-off-the-shelf battery as an interim measure until development of a smaller, lighter battery pack can be completed. The current effort is to leverage the technology advances made to date, complete battery development, and fabricate a prototype for required Government test and evaluation. Given the significant Government investment that has gone into development of this regulatory-compliant fluid warmer technology, and the fact that it can be leveraged to speed development of a more compact battery pack for a portable, battery-powered fluid warmer, it would not be practical to turn to another contractor to develop this system as most of the technological and regulatory hurdles have already been largely overcome through application of proprietary engineering solutions. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document exists. Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability within the established timeframe is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Officer by way of the Contract Specialist within fifteen calendar days from the date of publication of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firms ability to provide the stated capability within the established timeframe. Information can be sent to the Contract Specialist, Kathryn McCune at kathryn.mccune@us.army.mil. No telephone requests will be accepted. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.

(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: The Contractor represents that it [ ] is, [ ] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 624230 assigned to contract number (Determined at Award).[Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show—

(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;

(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and 
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. 
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. 
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. 
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and— 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or 
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

The following DLAD provisions are hereby added in full text:

DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests (Sep 1999)
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity’s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.

DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) (Jun 2001)
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

Request for Quotation (RFQ) due date and time is May 23, 2008 @ 1:00PM local time.

The solicitation number is HSFE02-08-R-0001 and is issued as a Request for Proposal.

1.0	Background

FEMA’s mission encompasses the centralized direction of emergency management in both peacetime and war and for emergencies ranging from natural disasters to nuclear war.  FEMA carries out its responsibilities through a field organization of ten Regional Offices, five Federal Regional Centers, Joint Field Offices, Long Term Recovery Offices, the Mt. Weather Emergency Operations Center (MWEOC), the National Emergency Training Center (NETC), Washington DC, the Olney Federal Support Center and fixed disaster processing sites.

It is the government’s desire to have a single solution providing telephone and secure encrypted Internet service with TCP acceleration with all portable satellite systems.  The current network ground entry point is PanAmSat’s Atlanta teleport, located in Ellenwood, GA and is connected via a private link to FEMA Region IV headquarters, located in Atlanta, GA.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to award a sole source purchase order for software maintenance to Government Acquisitions.  The order will provide EMC software, hardware, and annual maintenance services for Production Enterprise Computing and Computer Security Audit Trail.  The contractor will assist the IRS with EMC Storage, which is a required standard for UNIX in the Enterprise Architecture (EA).  The new storage equipment will join EMC equipment that is already on site at IRS and built out to meet the needs of the IRS Modernization effort and the customers of the applications.   A Request for Quote (RFQ) was sent to eight (8) GSA schedule vendors that were identified as EMC providers and none were able to provide the required software and maintenance as none had the required software and maintenance on schedule.  EMC lost their GSA schedule contract and Government Acquisitions is the only vendor that can provide all of the EMC products for the requirements.  The government intends to award a firm fixed price order.  The award will be made on an all or none basis.  All responsible sources who can provide the above requirements shall submit written quotations no later than 5 days from the posted date of this announcement.   No solicitation will be issued, therefore, requests for solicitations will be considered non-responsive.  If no responses are received the award will be made to Government Acquisitions.

SCOPE OF WORK

Democracy and Governance Program Leader

I.  Background:

USAID/Morocco’s Democracy and Governance (D/G) program aims to support the Government of Morocco (GOM) in its efforts to do a better job of responding to the needs of its citizens in keeping with best practices of good governance.  This work also encourages citizens to engage with government and public administration through representative institutions to better and more effectively express their needs. Within the Arab world, the Kingdom of Morocco is the country where the process of political liberalization has been sustained for the longest period of time.  Morocco has received praise over the past year from those who follow closely the evolution of democracy in the Middle East, but it is clear that much remains to be done.

The D/G program strives to support systems that inform central debates and leadership for improvements over the long term while building a partnership between citizens and government to immediately deliver tangible results at the local level.  Future programming will seek to promote more democratic and participatory governance in order to increase transparency and accountability in the public sector and engage citizens at all levels in their priority policy issues. The current program, Improved Government Responsiveness to Citizens, includes four intermediate results; 1) National Enabling Environment Supported which includes a parliamentary strengthening activity; 2) Transparency in Governance Encouraged; 3) Enhanced Legitimacy and Credibility of Representative Actors at the National and Sub-National Levels; and, 4)  Local Governance Performance Improved,   A new D/G strategy, now being developed as part of USAID’s five-year program strategy for 2009-2013, will build capacity on the demand side of the democracy equation (especially in terms of more effective representation of citizen concerns by civil society, by representative institutions and by political parties) and, on the supply side, will support the development of a more effective, accountable administration at the local and regional levels . Under the new strategy, there will be a strong, across-the-board emphasis on youth and promoting their engagement in Moroccan civic and economic life. As part of that strategy development, specific targets and indicators for the democracy program will be adopted, and the D/G team will be the USAID entity primarily responsible for their achievement.

The D/G Program Leader will serve in the D/G Office, USAID/Morocco.  The incumbent will be expected to work independently, with minimal oversight from the Mission Director, based on a general assignment of responsibilities.  The incumbent will produce an annual work plan for accomplishing complex duties and responsibilities, and will be responsible for daily management of D/G activities.  Due to the high level of responsibility in this position, the D/G Program Leader will have wide latitude in the exercise of her/his duties for program design, management, and evaluation, and for the identification and resolution of issues affecting program performance both within and outside of the Mission.  The incumbent is considered the Mission’s lead democracy expert with all of the duties and responsibilities of a senior USAID officer.

II. Duties and Responsibilities:

The D/G Program Leader will provide leadership, guidance, and overall direction on the development and execution of USAID/Morocco’s activities under the D/G Strategic Objective, both as currently conceived under the Mission’s 2004-2008 Strategic Plan and as finally agreed-upon for the new 2009-2013 strategy.

Specific duties and responsibilities shall include, but are not limited to:

1.	Serves as the senior advisor to the Mission Director and senior GOM officials on policy and programs related to democratic reform.

2.

3.	Participates and makes recommendations related to the design and implementation of strategies, plans and budgets for these activities.  Develop and implement a framework for measuring and reporting on implementation progress and program impact.

4.	Manages the annual reporting, operational planning, and activity review process for all democracy activities in the Mission and coordinates such with relevant personnel in AID/Washington.  Prepares and disseminates regular reports on the impact and results of the democracy activities.  Maintains memoranda of record to document substantive discussions and important decisions originating from meetings with implementing agencies or other entities.  Assesses the data furnished by contractors and grantees for accuracy and completeness, performing necessary data verification steps for full validation of results.

5.	Ensures that all administrative and accountability requirements related to USAID/Morocco’s democracy portfolio are handled in accordance with established policies and procedures.  

6.	Maintains a wide range of contacts with national, regional and local government officials, members of Parliament and other elected bodies, academics, NGO leaders, the U.S. Embassy and other donors or institutions in the D/G arena.  Represents USAID in dealing with all these contacts and confers with them to obtain compliance with commitments and to resolve problems.  As such, resolves complex problems related to program development and activity management.

7.	Liaises with other donors and develops procedures to assure complementarities of democracy-related activities.  Provides USAID/ Morocco, the U.S. Embassy, and USAID/Washington with information on similar projects or activities implemented by other donors in Morocco.  Maintains day-to-day contact with the DG implementers, including grantees and contractors and short-term advisors regarding their activities.

8.	Supervises, evaluates, and provides guidance to USAID/Morocco D/G team, which is composed of three Foreign Service National team members.

III.  Supervision and Relationships:

The D/G Program Leader will serve as the key manager for ensuring the smooth implementation of a complex and highly visible democracy program.  S/he will work under the direction of the USAID/Morocco Mission Director, or her designee.  Performance of the incumbent shall be in relation to the above statement of work and the general technical and administrative objectives of USAID/Morocco’s Democracy and Governance Program.

Standards of evaluation will include timely performance of tasks, quality and acceptability of written products, effectiveness of interpersonal communication, management and leadership skills, working as a team player with the broader mission and effectiveness in accomplishing the scope of work.  These shall be manifested in the preparation of annual work objectives and requirements.  A review/update of these objectives will be carried out at least annually.

The incumbent shall ensure effective coordination and information sharing with the USAID/Morocco staff and personnel of implementing and other donor agencies.  In this capacity, s/he shall also work closely with offices of the U.S. Embassy, the Department of State, democracy-related institutions and other key individuals useful and necessary to the full accomplishment of the objectives of USAID/Morocco’s D/G program.

The incumbent has no authority to make commitments on behalf of the USG; however, recommendations are given substantial weight by USAID officials who exercise that authority.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<CONTACT>Hugh J. Williams, Email hugh.williams@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><p>These questions were submitted to the contracting office on 15 May at 2:03am Eastern Time by an interested vendor. The Contract administrator answered those questions on 15 May at 9:55am Eastern Time.
<p>**<br />a) You have given us the size of the engine and guidelines on materials to use. Do we design our own covers within the guidelines set in the solicitation to fit the engine or do you have a specific implementation you are looking for?<br />Yes you design/provide your own covers within the guidelines set in the solicitation to fit the engine.</p>
<p><br />b) We understand the liner is 14X14 HDPE mesh? Is there is a specific denier or lamination specified? Is the liner the same size as the cover?<br />Yes it is HDPE mesh. There is no specific denier or lamination specified, but the user will examine the best product and look for the best value for the government. The liner needs to cover the entire engine.</p>
<p>c) What size is the hardware, and what quantity? Is there hardware on the other side of the picture, or only along one side. Where are the snaps going, and how many? Where are the snaps, D-rings and buckles located?<br />From the photo you can see that the snaps and D-rings are all around the engine along the middle of the cover. The snaps/fasteners need to ensure that the engine is secure.</p>
<p>d) Will there be any silk-screen or customization on the covers (like the pix shows). How much of an overlap is there, and how deep are the seams?<br />No customization is required. The overlap between the top and bottom covers and how deep the seems are is unknown. There were no requirements/specifications sent by the customer for these areas.</p>
<p>e) What are the blue straps around the cover? Are they added later and not provided by us?<br />I believe those bunjie cords were provided by the last customer. They can be added into your quote if you feel it is necessary but again, there were no cords suggested in the purchase request.</p>
<p>f) Can we sew the vinlylpieces together, or do they need to be heat-sealed?<br />If heat sealing will secure the engine better that is one aspect of your particular quote. Some vendors are heat sealing, some are not.</p>
<p>g) Do you have any samples of the cover we may access? Can you tell us the company whose part number is in the solicitation?<br />The previous vendor was: King Bag &amp; Manufacturing http://www.kingbag.com</p>
<p>May we request an extension on the response date?<br />The solicitation has been extended once already, and because of the fact it is a small purchase, I will only extend it for one day. Also, you are able to submit two quotes if you feel you are able to offer different options.</p>

<DESC>1. This is Amendment 0001 to synopsis AAC685ARSS080424 for DUAL PURPOSE AMMUNITION FOR THE F-35 AIRCRAFT GUN SYSTEM (GAU-22A).  The purpose of this amendment is to amend the original synopsis with additional information.  The planned scope of effort for this Air Force procurement is upon a successful Foreign Comparative Test evaluation in early FY11, the 25mm x137 Frangible Armor Piercing (FAP) combat round will become a qualified round for the GAU-22A/U gun system.  To integrate this combat round onto the F-35 during the F-35's SDD program, our budget submission will be made during the Air Combat Command (ACC) POM12 build using the Program Element (PE) 27142.  Funding for this round will include funds for testing of the rounds on aircraft test (F-35), additional funds for a medium caliber SPO, and specific round lethality assessment.

2. ACC plans to budget the following increments for on aircraft testing 130K rounds delivery through FY13. 

3. Upon successful on aircraft testing of this round, ACC is additionally planning to fund support for War Readiness Materials (WRM) inventory and for minimal annual training use.  WRM requirements will be determined by the MAJCOMs' planning factors.  Based upon existing requirements, it is expected that the WRM requirement over a period of 10 years is an expected outlay of $125M.

4. Closing date remains unchanged from 13 June 2008.  Closing time 4:00 pm Central remains unchanged.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTIONT-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability
PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
           We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data. The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010 with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2011.
	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical / engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified as integrated into the T-1 aircraft.

TITLE: B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RFP - FINAL REVIEW
DESCRIPTION: The B-2 Training System RFP is in Final Review.  The B-2 Training System team intends to release the Final RFP, once Business Clearance is approved.  This notice of contract action is required to satisfy FAR 5.2 Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, specifically 5.203 Publicizing and Response Time.
PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.

************************************************************************************5/12/08
TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

<SOLNBR>2004-5VA30224-0-9
<RESPDATE>051608
<ARCHDATE>05172008
<CONTACT>David A Newsom, Phone 202-482-7417, Email dnewsom@bis.doc.gov
<DESC><p>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) has issued a Notification of Intent (NOI) of its Intention for Bidding (IFB) from all NATO countries related to is plan to provide a long term commercial Satellite Communications System (SATCOM) to support the International Security Assistance Force&rsquo;s (ISAF) Expansion. This project is an Urgent Requirement in support of ISAF and will be funded under the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). The North Atlantic Council has approved the expansion of the ISAF mission to support a number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and forward operating bases expanding the current ISAF area of operation. This has resulted in a very urgent operational requirement to provide the long-term communications and Communications and Information Systems (CIS) infrastructure to enable the Commander of ISAF to exercise command and control over this enlarged mission. In addition to the urgency of this requirement, there is a critical shortage of available deployable NATO CIS capability, both in terms of equipment and manpower. Analysis conducted by Allied Command Operations concluded that it is inappropriate to use military equipment to provide satellite baseband support for the ISAF mission expansion. These scarce assets are required for the NATO Response Force (NRF) and there is a very high cost of deploying military containers and vehicles to Afghanistan. This ISAF CIS solution is expected to be needed for at least five (5) years. Discussions with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) showed even if this capability was available today, the scalable and expected long term nature of CIS support to ISAF would still best be served by outsourcing a service to provide this capability. NATO will require its limited deployable CIS assets for the NRF which may be tasked with rapid and short duration deployments. The required capability will provide CIS services and their embedded communications services from a NATO manned facility in Kabul to over 30 remote locations, or Points of Presence (POP), within Afghanistan where other NATO units will be based. This includes local CIS network infrastructure, equipment and personnel. Any contractor delivered solution must be capable of supporting further ISAF mission expansion if and when this is authorized by NATO. This project considers and uses, where possible, equipment from earlier projects, specifically serial 2004/5VA30223 &ndash; Provide Commercial SATCOM to Support ISAF Expansion (IOC). Only equipment and services considered essential to expand and support ISAF expansion complying with the Minimum Military Requirement (MMR) are requested. THIS PROGRAM IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING AUTHORIZED AND THE ESTIMATED TIME FRAME FOR THE RELEASE OF THE INVITATION FOR BIDDING (IFB)/REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) IS THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005. ALL FIRMS INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROCUREMENT MUST BE CERTIFIED AND NOMININATED BY THEIR NATIONAL DELEGATIONS WITH THE REQUIRED DECLARATION OF ELIGIBILITY. REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM FIRMS MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED. YOUR FIRM MUST BE CERTIFIED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE BID MATERIALS FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DOES NOT SERVE AS THE CONTRACTING AGENCY FOR NATO PROJECTS. NC3A IS THE CONTRACTING ENTITY.

<DESC><p>Soliciation Question and Answer:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Question: With reference to Technical Acceptability Factor 1 listed under General Instructions page 39 of 41; the offerors are supposed to provide system proof, design, adaptability etc., for the equipment to be purchased (shelving). From the SOW Schedule B, it certainly appears the Government desires Lyon brand shelving. Are we to assume that an "or equal" brand can be substituted as long as we meet the proof requirements stated in Factor 1?</p>
<p>Answer:&nbsp; Yes, it is the Government's intent for the offeror to consider/propose an "equal" brand shelving as long as you meet the proof requirements stated in Factor 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Can we reasonably assume award would be approximately 1 June based on the submission cut-off date? If that is nearly correct, it would take time to procure, then a week to assemble/prep for sea shipment, and roughly 30 days to sea ship. Arrival of initial sets of shelving for first block would in all probability, extend past the Period of Performance start date of 1 July 2008. This may mean air shipment for initial sets, and will certainly increase price. Is the start date reflective of personnel and preparation, or does the Government expect initial sets of shelving to be installed at start date?</p>
<p>The Government is expecting to award this contract on-or-about 1 June 2008.&nbsp; The start date of 1 July 2008 (30 days after contract award), as stated in SOW para 2.2, reflects date the initial set of shelving to be installed.&nbsp; However, you can provide an alternative proposal in which the performance start date may differ and price it accordingly.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on behalf of and as an agent of the Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified ventilators to be a necessity for pandemic flu preparedness and response.  The purpose of this solicitation is to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for portable ventilators (all same make and model) with delivery to stockpile location(s) in support of pandemic flu preparedness and response.  Resulting awardee shall also be capable of providing re-supply kits, along with end-user training and sustain a 60-month (five year) maintenance support agreement that will include rotation of approximately one third of the ventilators shipping from Government location to offerors location for annual preventative and recertification maintenance.  The objective is to insure availability and consistency of product for stockpile and if need be, deployment in the event of pandemic flu outbreak.  The base contract period will be for one year (or less, depending on date of award), with one (4) option periods that may be exercised by the Government.   It is the Governments desire that the contractor shall provide consistent deliveries of portable ventilators and re-supply kits within an 18-month period.  Offerors are requested to propose a delivery schedule that can be accomplished within this timeframe or sooner and if not within this timeframe, include appropriate reasons why not.  Delivery shall be within the continental United States.  NOTE: Due to the national security and sensitive aspects of this program, information such as final delivery location(s) and point of contact(s) are considered confidential and as such shall only be disclosed to the resultant awardee.  Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of this procurement the contractor and affiliates shall be required to complete a confidentiality agreement within five (5) days of award.  Offeror must be able to provide standard commercial warranty term of at least one year after date of shipment as part of the mandatory characteristics (minimum requirements).  Because of the uniqueness of the DSNS stockpile program and this related procurement, the Government desires a warranty term that would begin at the point of 1st deployment of ventilators and continue through one year.  Offerors are encouraged to consider this optional characteristic provision and to include their response to this provision in the business proposal.  This provision as it is offered will be included in the price analysis portion of the evaluation.  Distributors/dealers are required to submit a letter from the manufacturer/s of the offered portable ventilators guaranteeing a source of supply for the term of the contract.  This letter must be from the manufacturer and on the manufacturers stationary.  Offers from distributors/dealers that do not submit the letter of commitment from the manufacturer will be rejected.
