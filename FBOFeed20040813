<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services, has a requirement for bioengineering services for validating standards for eliminating the presence of spring viremia of carp virus (SVCv) in the influent water of fisheries.  USDA intends to award a firm-fixed price contract for these services in accordance with the statement of work attached below.    The solicitation will be issued on or about August 24, 2004.  The solicitation will be posted to this website.  The Government intends to provide the solicitation and all amendments via this web site only.  NOTIFICATIONS WILL NOT BE SENT TO OFFEROR REGARDING THE ISSUANCE OF THE SOLICITATION NOR ANY OF ITS AMENDMENTS.  IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THIS WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR UPDATES.  

Statement of Work:

Bioengineering Services for Validating Standards for Eliminating the Presence of Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCv) in the Influent Water of Fisheries


Background
Spring Viremia of Carp virus (SVCv) was identified at Blue Ridge Fish Hatchery, Inc. (BRFH) in the spring of 2002.  On July 8, 2003 a compliance agreement was established between BRFH and USDA, APHIS, VS for the eradication of SVCv from BRFH premises.  This agreement included an Action Plan establishing the procedures to be implemented at BRFH facilities for removal of susceptible species, cleaning and disinfection of premises and equipment, replacing water, and restocking.  Since that time, USDA, APHIS, VS has conducted activities to remove susceptible species and clean and disinfect premises and equipment.  BRFH and USDA, APHIS, VS are currently in the process of carrying out the procedures necessary for replacing water and restocking.  One of the requirements in these procedures is that influent water must be from an approved source.  Approved sources are bore hole water, well water, first use spring water, or surface water treated to USDA, APHIS, VS standards and approved by USDA, APHIS, VS.  BRFH has chosen to use treated surface water to fill the ponds.

APHIS set forth general guidelines in the Action Plan that BRFH must adhere to in order to qualify their systems as approved water sources.  Among these, is a requirement that the systems be validated.  Proper validation of the systems by a technical expert will insure APHIS that the systems are set up appropriately to meet APHIS guidelines for reducing or eliminating pathogen load in influent water.  This validation of the systems set up at BRFH is currently underway.

APHIS is now ready to pursue a larger validation project related to the use of sand filtration and UV treatment to eliminate pathogens, such as SVCv, from potentially contaminated surface waters.

Objectives
Validation of the use of sand filtration and UV treatment, as prescribed by APHIS in the “Protocol for Management of Incidences of Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCV),” to eliminate pathogens, such as SVCv, from potentially contaminated surface waters.  This validation will improve the ability of APHIS to offer this method of obtaining influent water to other fisheries interested in using SVCv free water sources.  The ability to use this type of system could be important to many fisheries interested in certifying stock for sales and for any fisheries that might be involved in a post-infection clean-up plan in the future.  This validation would also enhance APHIS activities regarding setting forth program standards for an SVC Control and Eradication Program in the United States.

Scope
The technical specialists provided by the contractor would identify references on the reduction of SVCv in water using UV treatment systems and compare information from those references to the current standards outlined by APHIS; assist in the development or procurement of a water test for presence of SVCv; develop a protocol for using a water test for SVCv to determine the efficacy of water treatment systems; and make recommendations regarding water treatment standards that must be met to insure elimination of SVCv from influent waters.  The contractor would provide written reports detailing the findings at each stage of the project.  

Any references identified regarding the reduction of SVCv in water using UV treatment systems will be provided to APHIS in full text. In addition, a report detailing the comparison of information from those references to the current standards outlined by APHIS will be prepared and provided to APHIS.

Any currently available water test for the presence of SVCv, will be evaluated and a written report on the applicability of such test will be completed.  If a currently available test, which meets the needs of APHIS for evaluating the UV water treatment systems, is identified, the contractor will also identify, in writing, sources for procurement of that test.  If no currently available test is determined to be able to meet the needs of APHIS for evaluating the UV water treatment systems, the contractor will assist in the development of a water test for presence of SVCv which can be used for evaluation the UV water treatment systems.  This assistance might include providing APHIS with written reports detailing the components needed for such a test and their assembly and use to create such a test.  It might also include development and testing of a “prototype” test.

Once a suitable water test has been identified or developed, the contractor will develop a protocol for using the water test for SVCv to determine the efficacy of water treatment systems.  This protocol will detail the proper use of the test from water collection to interpretation of results.

The contractor will use the test and protocol set out to test systems installed to APHIS UV water treatment standards and will make written recommendations regarding water treatment standards that must be met to insure elimination of SVCv from influent waters.

The contractor will provide written reports with supportive scientific documentation in response to questions and concerns, from APHIS, relating to this validation program.

Requirements
The objective of awarding this contract is to provide technical specialists to assist APHIS in validating water treatment guidelines to be used to insure SVCv-free water sources for fisheries.  These specialists are expected to be able to effectively perform all tasks necessary for complete validation of water treatment systems for the elimination of SVCv from surface water sources.

Selection Criteria
The agency needs experts in water treatment systems and use of these systems in an aquaculture setting.  The qualifications necessary to perform the validation of the influent water treatment process for SVCv include knowledge of aquaculture, fisheries biology, fisheries bioengineering, fish health, biosecurity, influent water treatment systems, filtration processes for solids removal, disinfection processes for pathogen reduction, and testing processes for viral pathogens.  Qualifications should also include experience in the design of solids removal and disinfection systems for influent/effluent hatchery water treatment.  Design expertise should be demonstrated in completed projects that utilize solids removal followed by ultraviolet irradiation for the exclusion of pathogens into or containment of pathogens out of aquaculture facilities.  

Deliverables
Contractor shall, upon request, be available for consultation within 48 hours to provide scientific advice and oversight.  Contractor shall provide written reports and documentations as needed to include written reports detailing the findings at each stage of the project, as outlined above. Written reports indicating progress and current status will be completed at least quarterly.  

Government-furnished equipment and Government-furnished information
Contractor will be furnished with the APHIS protocol for Management of Incidences of Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCv), the Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCv) Action Plan for Blue Ridge Fish Hatchery, Inc. (BRFH) Farm Locations, and other information about APHIS operations in relation to SVCv as needed to perform the validation work.

Security
Contractor will have limited availability to data via specified e-mail.  Contractor will not have access to USDA, APHIS, VS private files or databases.

Place of Performance
Contractor work will be performed primarily from the office site of the contractor and on-site at locations with installed UV water treatment systems for surface waters used to fill fisheries.  APHIS, prior to work being conducted at such sites, must approve other sites identified as necessary to perform all stages of the validation process by the contractor.

Period of Performance
This contract shall be in place for the period of approximately one year or until validation of APHIS standards for water treatment of surface waters for use as SVCv-free water sources is completed.  Both parties may amend the contract at such time deemed necessary by mutual agreement in writing.

<DESC>The Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS), 4300 West 7th Street, Little Rock, Arkansas intends to negotiate a sole source contract for a Krimesite Imager with Direct View Kit System by Sirchie Finger Print Company, Raleigh, NC. The Government believes that Sirchie Print Company is the sole and exclusive manufacturer, assembled and distributed from Sirchie’s Youngsville, North Carolina manufacturing facility and is not available for purchase through any other source. This is sole source procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1).  The Krimesite Imager with Direct View Kit System is an FAL2000 Gold Panther Forensic Light Source System utilizes Reflective Ultraviolet Imaging technology, also known as RUVIS, to locate latent fingerprints that are invisible to the naked eye, on most nonporous surfaces, without the prior use of powders, chemicals or vapor treatments of any kind.  And, unlike alternate light sources and lasers, the Krimesite Imager is not affected by ambient light, which means it can be used in a broad range of environments, including daylight or total darkness, indoors or outdoors. The Krimesite Imager works by its ability to selectively amplify 254nm shortwave ultraviolet light and ignoring all other wavelengths of light.  The chief natural source of UV light is the sun.   This UV light reflects off of the residues left behind in a fingerprint and into our specially designed UV lens on the Krimesite Imager. The UV bandpass filter in the Krimesite Imager selectively passes this band of UV light to the high gain image intensifier tube while ignoring all other bands of wavelength, including visible light.  The UV light entering the intensifier tube is then amplified several thousand times and converted into visible light providing a visible image of the untreated fingerprint. The Law Enforcement Training Center will be able to rapidly search a crime scene for ‘untreated’ latent fingerprints, at a distance, resulting in improved efficiency in locating evidence that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. The NAICS Number is 339999. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes, however; any firm that believes that it can meet the specifications above may give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, CAVHS will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Sirchie Finger Print Company.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is releasing Soliciation No. DG1321-04-RP-0044 as a small business set aside to provide the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) support for the development of an annual and/or quarterly quality-adjusted price index. 

The index is for the period beginning no later than 1997 and spaning at least seven (7) years, for custom software to be used to deflate both public and private fixed investment in custom software in the NIPAs.

BEA provides many economic measurements as part of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs).  The NIPAs are used for a variety of purposes in setting national economic policy and in forecasting and interpreting macroeconomic activity.  They include gross domestic product (GDP), which is considered the most useful summary measure of the nation’s production.  They also include critical comprehensive measures of the nation’s income, including gross domestic income (GDI), corporate profits, and personal income.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, Series R (GOES-R) program, under the National Environmental Satellite and Data Information Service (NESDIS), Office of Systems Development (OSD), proposes to enter into a contract with Hampton University, Center for Atmospheric Sciences, of Hampton, VA.  The authority for execution of this proposed contract by NOAA is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), “only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements”.  The term of the contract will be for 12 months, with two (2) 12-month options for extensions to the term of performance.   The estimated value of this study during the first year, and for each of the succeeding years, is $140,000/yr.  During the initial year of performance, and expanding in the second and third year, the Hampton University will develop an analysis capability to generate sea surface temperature products that will be used in studies aimed at preparing for the utilization of raw, cloudy Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), and Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES) data.  These data will be grouped with retrieved cloud properties from space based instruments, such as MODIS and AIRS, to develop three and four dimensional variational data collection techniques using cloudy radiances, to specify sea surface temperature and surface state products affected by clouds.  Included in this study will be development of a Radiative Transfer Model capable of processing the large amount of hyper spectral radiance data needed to complete the analyses.  In a subsequent stage of this study an airborne platform will be used to test the model.  These data will allow the principal GOES-R instruments, HES and ABI, to optimize the observation data for atmospheric and sea surface states with enhanced model-generated background fields that will generate the optimal sea surface temperature products.  This study is integral to developing a model that can assimilate the large volume of radiances to derive the sea surface products that will leverage observations captured by the HES and ABI instruments.  The collaborative team led by Dr. William L. Smith of Hampton University is the single, uniquely qualified team capable of developing, testing, and validating sea surface products using the RTM model that they will develop, and the associated space-based observation products.  The study team led by Dr. Smith has spent considerable time, and acquired unique expertise in this field, developing surface product algorithms based on radiative observations for the NPOESS program.  Therefore, this Hampton University team has the unique knowledge that can only be gained though having designed, tested, and analyzed similar, related sea surface observational modeling techniques, databases, and platforms.  The singular expertise and resources of the Hampton University, Center for Atmospheric Sciences, cannot be secured from other public or private institutions.  Any other party desiring consideration for this requirement must  identify its full capability in writing to the Contracting Officer within 45 days of this publication.  No RFP or solicitation is available.  No further CBD notice is planned.  IMPORTANT CONTRACT INFO:  POC:  Jay W. Moore; (301) 713-1055, extension 159; 1335 E. W. Highway, Rm. 6213, M/S E/OSD, Silver Spring, MD 20910.  jay.moore@noaa.gov.  SEE NOTES 22, 25 and 26.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for fabrication and testing of twelve 12" x 12" Unidirectional and Fabric-Based Composite Sandwich Panels, as follows: (1).  Laminated Composite Panels, from Unidirectional T650-35/RS-3, Six 12x12x0.046", Test Verified (lap/interlaminar shear, tension/compression). (2).  Laminated Composites Panels, from T650-35/RS-3 Fabric, Six 12x12x0.046", test verified (lap/interlaminar shear, tension/compression). NASA is in the process of evaluating several candidate materials (commercially available) for possible application to aerocapture technology.   It is critical to this evaluation process that the above panels be fabricated and tested.   These panels are critical to demonstration and validation of materials for a flight demonstration article that will be part of NASA's New Millennium Program. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the fabricated items and related testing services from ATK Composites (Composite Optics, Inc.) located in Magna, Utah.  The Authority For Other Than Full and Open Competition is FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. ATK Composites is currently the only contractor who is capable and available for both fabricating these panels and ensuring that the as-fabricated articles are compatible with required thermal protection system (TPS) materials (PhenCarb and SRAM).  The PhenCarb and SRAM materials (to which compatibility must be demonstrated) are available from only one source, and ATK Composite Optics is the only contractor with license to purchase the required TPS materials for the purpose of evaluating compatibility.   ATK Composites has unique expertise and capability for this work, is a space-qualified firm, and has access to the related compatible TPS materials.  For these reason, ATK Composites is considered the only responsible source that can meet agency requirements for this purchase.  In addition, because these panels are required to meet preliminary requirements for an ongoing program that has test facilities and other fixed milestones in place, there is an unusual and compelling urgency for this recommended source. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 30, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research related to basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines and novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and improvements in public health.  As part of its research program to improve defense against potential agents of bioterrorism, the NIAID seeks to establish Immune Modeling Centers.  These multi-disciplinary Centers will develop novel or improved highly predictive mathematical models to define host immune responses to infection, as well as vaccination and other therapeutic interventions used to protect against NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).  In some cases, immunological mechanisms relevant to biodefense are broadly applicable for many pathogens and may be most efficiently studied using model systems.  Inclusion of immunological research that is not directed specifically at NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens or their products is responsive to this solicitation if it directly addresses a practical approach to developing mathematical models to define host immune responses to infection, as well as vaccination and other therapeutic interventions against NIAID Category A, B, or C pathogens.    Knowledge gained from these studies will advance our understanding of the delicate balance required to induce protective immunity and guide laboratory experiments of host immune responses against infectious agents.  Results obtained from these programs will sharpen our assessments of vaccine efficacy and responses to other prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, and will advance development of novel or improved vaccines, prophylactics, and immunotherapeutics against NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens.   

It is anticipated that two to three (2-3) cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately July 29, 2005. RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-BAA-05-10 will be available electronically on or about August 20, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

NIAID/CMB Home Page (via the WWW): Use http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract to access the NIAID/CMB Home Page.  Once at the NIAID/CMB Home Page, click on the "RFPs" link and then click on " RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-BAA-05-10."

Please note that the RFP has been revised to include only the Work Statement, Deliverable and Reporting Requirements, Special Requirements, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and the Specific RFP Instructions and Provisions.  All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package. 

Responses to this RFP will be due on November 23, 2004.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal for consideration by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.   No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to solicit on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basis for the acquisition of Administrative and Clerical Support Services at the Training Air Wing Two (TW-2) located at Naval Air Station, Kingsville, TX. The services will be accomplished through a modification extending the performance period under the existing Purchase Order N00140-01-M-0956.  The extension will consist of a 1-month period and 2, 1-month options. The extension is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Symtech Corporation, 6564 Loisdale Court, Suite 410, Springfield, VA 22150-1812), under the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a).  The purpose of this extension is to allow sufficient time to complete the procurement process for the competitive follow-on contract.  The applicable NAICS code is 561110 with a size standard of $6M. The Government intends to acquire the services from Symtech since they are the only source that currently has the personnel and the infrastructure in place to perform the requisite services by 1 October 2004 without the an additional 30-day phase-in period (starting 1 September 2004) that would be required from a different source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all requests within forty-five days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  The Government will not pay for information received.  Responses to this synopsis should be mailed to the attention of Ms. Kristi Brown, Code 02P23A, FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Phila., PA 19111-5083.

The RFQ was issued on 10 June 2004, closed on 13 July 2004 and is currently under evaluation.

<DESC>NOAA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Colorado Office of Contracts and Grants in support of proposal title “The Contribution of Tide Gauges to Sea Level Change Studies”.  The Period of Performance is date of award through June 30, 2005.  Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research (CCAR), working closely with NOAA/NESDIS, will conduct a survey of the tide gauges that are in close proximity to GPS or DORIS sites, and then develop estimates of the vertical motion of these sites through a combination of 1) GPS data analysis, 2) GPS results from other centers, and 3) DORIS results from French Colleagues.  Also, CCAR will perform a rigorous error analysis so that the vertical crustal motion estimates have realistic error bars.  CCAR will use in-situ oceanographic measurements to study the aliasing problem for the tide gauges, which is critical for understanding if T/P has observed a significant increase in the rate of the sea level change.   The contractor shall provide a final report that will present CCAR’s estimate of vertical crustal velocities at select tide gauge sites, an estimate of the errors in these velocities, and an assessment of the impact of these velocities/errors on the tide gauge estimates of long-term sea level change.  In addition, the report will discuss progress CCAR has made on understanding the tide gauge sampling problem, and provide an assessment of long-term sea level change from tide gauges that can be used for comparisons to similar estimates derived from satellite altimetry.Notwithstanding the Government’s intent to negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with the University of Colorado, responsible sources may submit a response which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA.  This notice satisfies the public display requirement set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101(a)(2).

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) intends to noncompetitively negotiate with American Association For Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA), 5301 Buckeystown Pike, Frederick, MD 21704, to provide laboratory accreditation services. The proposed contract period will include the base year, October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005, with four one year option periods. The requirement is for the accreditation/certification of FSIS laboratories located in Athens, GA, St. Louis, MO, and Alameda, CA. The objectives are to assess each FSIS laboratory as follows: 1) is competent to perform specific tests; 2) maintains a quality system that addresses and conforms to all elements of ISO/IEC Standard 17025; 3) maintains the required documentation; 4) is operational. After completion of the assessment a written report of the assessor’s findings shall be submitted. Upon completion of a satisfactory assessment, the accrediting body shall provide a letter and certificates stating that the laboratory is in compliance with ISO/IEC Standard 17025 requirements as well as the Association of Analytical Communities (AOAC) International's "Accreditation Criteria for Laboratories Performing Food Microbiological and Chemical Analyses in Food, Feeds, and Pharmaceutical Testing" (ALACC). The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) is the sole assessment body possessing established cooperative arrangements with laboratory accreditation systems both internationally and in the United States. These arrangements facilitate the acceptance of test data between the A2LA-accredited laboratories and other countries, a critical element for FSIS laboratories regarding international equivalency and trade issues. These cooperative arrangements assure that FSIS laboratory data is recognized and accepted by these accrediting organizations and therefore the government in the countries that recognize the organization as an accrediting body. Examples of the cooperative arrangements include the Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation, the European Cooperation for Accreditation, The Inter-American Accreditation Cooperation and National Cooperation for Laboratory Accreditation (NACLA). NACLA is a U.S. accreditation body. These cooperative arrangements insure that the signatories agree to recognize the technical equivalency of each other's accreditations and therefore the data for the laboratories that they accredit is considered equivalent. This is not a request for competitive quotations. The Government anticipates conducting this acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures authorized under the test program in Subpart 13.5. No solicitation is available for this requirement. Interested concerns may submit a capability statement within 10 days after the posted date of this notice. All timely responses will be considered, however, a determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon the responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses should be addressed to the attention of the Contracting Officer referencing number SC-LQAD-5-01.

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W909MY-04-R-0024, soliciting white papers for applied research in land mine and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) detection and neutralization technologies, has been posted on the Single Face to Industry website, htt ps://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  The BAA is valid through Fiscal Year 2007, unless sooner terminated and is issued under provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) and paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for competitive select ion of research and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  This BAA is intended for the development of research efforts in support of the NVESD Science and Technology Division, Countermine Branch who manages tech base programs i n support of the Army countermine programs.  These include advanced technology programs for landmine detection such as integration and evaluation of infrared sensors, electro-optics, laser physics, hyperspectral analysis, target recognition, ground penetra ting and forward looking radar, chemical, nuclear, acoustic sensor technologies and avionic systems, on hand-held, airborne, ground, countermine system/sensors platforms; along with programmatic tasks related to documentation preparation and project coordi nation.  These programs also include neutralization efforts such as high-powered RF, microwave, burst laser systems, and projectile delivery systems.  Recent activities have expanded the role of NVESD to deal with the threat of IEDs. The overall goal of th is solicitation is to foster new development in countermine science and technology, which may ultimately lead to future operational capabilities as stated and outlined by current acquisition Science and Technology Objective (STO) programs and requirements.   By necessity, the applied research efforts in countermine (CM) are technically diverse.  The specific thrust areas as set forth in the BAA, are divided into detection and neutralization areas each representing technologies or techniques that would be imp lemented onto handheld, ground vehicular and or air-borne CM platforms.  These could also be manned or unmanned robotic, ground vehicular (UGV) and air-borne vehicular (UAV) platforms as well.  Threats to be detected and or neutralized include anti-personn el (AP) mines, anti-tank/vehicular (AT) mines, side-attack/off-route mines and improvised explosive devices (IED).  The deployments of these threats can be surface emplaced, buried and or obscured by foliage and other debris.   These threats are also deplo yed as nuisance, scatterable and patterned targets per military doctrine.  Award(s) against this BAA can be made for two years after notification of selectability.  The Government contemplates the awarding of Cost Reimbursement (Cost, CPFF) type contract(s ); however, proposals based on other contract types will be considered. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. The maximum length of an award will be three years. Prospective offerors should note  that this BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement.  The cost of proposal preparation for response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Submission of White Papers is mandatory prior to submission of a full  proposal.  White papers will be evaluated four times a year and will consist of those White Papers received during the preceding three months.  The annual submittal closing periods will be 10 October, 10 January, 10 April and 10 July.  White Papers shall be submitted via the IBOP following the instructions provided in the BAA. CECOM-Acquisition Center-Washington Sector will respond to each white paper with an in vitation to propose or a notification that a proposal will not be entertained.  Only those invited offerors will be permitted to submit a full proposal.  White Papers lacking scientific merit or relevance to Army needs, or those that may fall in areas wher ein funds are not expected to be available, may be rejected without further action.  Prior to White Paper submission, potential offerors are encouraged to contact the Topic/Subject Matter Expert. However, after White Paper submission, all questions and dis cussions must directed to the Contracting Officer.  The Science and Technology Point of Contact is Mr. Kelly Sherbondy, Tel: 703-704-2448   (DSN: 654-2448), E-mail:  Kelly.Sherbondy@nvl.army.mil.  The CECOM Acquisition Center Contracting Officer is Ms. Peg gy A. Melanson, Tel:  703-325-6096 (DSN:  221-6096), E-mail:  peggy.melanson@cacw.army.mil.  The selection of one or more proposals for award will be based on a peer and scientific evaluation of each offerors response (to include both technical and cost as pects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement. The basis for award, submittal instructions and evaluation criteria are set forth in the BAA.  Funds, beyond the current Fiscal Year, are not presently available for th e research interests represented in this BAA, however, funds are planned in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) for this research.  No contract award will be made unless appropriated funds are available for payment for the effort being acquired.  Offerors  are again directed to access the BAA at the Army Single Face to Industry Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP).  The URL for the IBOP is https://abop.monmouth.army.mil. In order to be able to access the BAA solicitation W909MY-04-R-0024, and subm it a white paper,  a contractor must first be registered on the IBOP.  A CAGE Code and DUNS number are required to complete registration for proposal submissions.  A contractor employee who is authorized to bind the contractor must complete the registratio n.

<CONTACT>Nicole Meenen, 256-955-1254
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command in conjunction with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Task Force (Joint IED TF) desires to award a sole source modification to contract W9113M-04-C-0012.  This action will sustain and enhance the in tegration of the Joint IED TF in the analysis, assessment and training for counter IED operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, as well as the preparation of units scheduled for introduction as replacement forces into overseas Areas of Responsibility .   The effort to be performed under this modification is in direct support of Operational forces in Iraq and Afghanistan who are experiencing frequent attacks by hostile forces using IEDs.  Roughly 40% of US casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan are the resu lt of such attacks.    Recently, this task force was redesignated the Joint IED Defeat Task Force by direction of the Deputy SECDEF and was tasked with the mission of focusing all available DOD resources to counter this threat.  Sustaining the existing sup port vehicle is essential to avoid inflicting significant harm to the government by unnecessarily forcing a suspension of contractor support, diminishing the overall counter-IED effort.  In addition, the Army G3 is currently developing plans for the establ ishment of a new unit, the Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) to accept hand-off of a portion of the Joint IED TF mission during FY05.  In addition to supporting the creation of a new unit, the Joint IED TF must continue all currently assigned missions and tas ks without interruption in order to support the needs of deployed forces in the Global War on Terrorism.  The Wexford Group International (WGI) possesses considerable expertise in the areas of counterinsurgency (CI) and counter terrorism (CT).  Specificall y, WGI has extensive experience in advisement and support concerning Joint Special Operations to include operational and developmental experience in the use of explosives and their initiation, the tactics and techniques associated with the use of explosive s Ã¢Â€Â“ particularly as it pertains to IEDs.  Moreover, their unique experience includes individuals with extensive backgrounds and established reputations in the development, organization, preparation and leadership of teams formed to respond in direct s upport of the vital interests of the Nation.  WGI has unique operational experience that allows WGI to continue uninterrupted support at a fair and reasonable price.  In addition, members of this team have already attained the necessary security clearances  (TS-SCI) and OCONOUS authorizations to be able to perform this mission to standard.  If a different support contractor were to be introduced at this juncture, an unnecessary interruption or delay would result for the schedule and performance of the Joint IED TF mission.  Substantial time and duplicative cost as well as potential for unacceptable degradation of the Joint IED TF mission would result if a different source were to be introduced at this juncture.

<DESC>The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDEC) Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA. has a requirement for an Anthropometric Study in support of Phase I for the Uniform System for Improved Tariffs (USFIT) Prog ram.  Following a response from industry, Sole Source Synopsis to Human Solutions of North America Inc., dated 22 July 2004, is hereby rescinded.  The Government intends to solicit this acquisition as a commercial service under Federal Acquisition Regulati on (FAR) Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures For Evaluation And Solicitation For Commercial Items and 13.5 Test Program For Certain Commercial Items. It is currently the goal of the US Army to integrate 3D body scanning technology into the existing clothi ng sizing and issue process at selected Clothing and Issue Facilities (CIF) across the country.  Obtaining 3D scans on every soldier will ensure that more consistent and accurate measurements are available for each soldier.  In order to successfully integr ate 3D scanning systems at selected military CIF's, a number of important tasks must be accomplished as follows: Tasks I -  Initial Software Development of Clothing Size Algorithms; Site Visit to CIF-Ft. Bliss, Texas; Purchase and Installation of Scanning System, (duration: 2 months); Task II:  Scanning Soldiers and Conducting Fit Assessments at Ft. Bliss, TX for Purposes of Size Selection Algorithm Optimization, (duration: 12 months); Task III: Site Visit to CIF-Ft. McCoy, WI:  Purchase and Installation of  Scanning System; Initial Validation of Size Selection Algorithms (duration: 6 Months); Task IV (optional):  Site Visits to CIF # 3 and CIF # 4 (locations to be determined); Purchase of two additional scanning systems; Scanning Soldiers and Conducting Fit Assessments at CIF # 3; Size Selection Algorithm Optimization at CIF # 4 (duration: 10 months); Task V:  Final Report and Briefing (duration: 3 months).  In addition, it will be necessary to coordinate this project with ongoing efforts by the Defense Logis tics Agency (DLA) to install a Human Solutions, Inc. scanning system and size selection software at the Ft. Carson, CO CIF. The data from the DLA project which will include individual soldier scans as well as fit test and issue data for each participant ar e extremely relevant for the current effort and will be used to further understand the relationship between soldier body size and best fitting clothing size.The Government anticipates awarding a single Firm Fixed-Price contract with one ordering period of approximately 18 months, including option for Task IV. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541330 with a size standard of $4 million. This acquisition will be an unrestricted procurement. The Re quest for Quotes (RFQ) will be available for download in the Natick Contracting Division web page at https://www3.natick.army.mil by approximately 18 August 2004 under Business Opportunities/Ongoing Acquisitions/W911QY-04-T-0100/Files Available for Downloa d with quotes due approximately 31 August 2004.

For consideration on this project the offeror at a minimum must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  For the design member of the design-build team, the Architect/Engineer (A/E) of Record of the architect-engineer firm, or the principal or lead A/E firm of a joint venture, must have an existing major active office, which will have responsibility for the plans and specifications,  located within the State of Arizona.

Participation by architects, engineers, consultants and subcontractors located within the State of Arizona is encouraged. Faith Based and Community-Based Organizations have the right to submit offers/bids equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.

The FBOP will be utilizing two-phase Design-Build selection procedures.  This notice is not a request for proposals.

Phase One solicitations will be issued on or about June 17, 2004.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One Solicitation.  The Phase One solicitation will provide the scope of work, and the following evaluation factors including subfactors, which are all in descending order of importance:  Past Performance (Sub-factors: Past  Performance Quality Control and Quality Assurance, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment of Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems), Technical Qualifications and Technical Approach.  Phase One qualification proposals will be evaluated to determine which firms will be selected as offerors for Phase Two.  Phase Two participants will submit competitive past performance, technical, and price proposals as defined in the Phase Two solicitation.  The Phase Two evaluation factors, in descending order of importance are:  Past Performance (descending order Sub-factors: Past Performance Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment of Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems);  Preliminary Design and Proposed Technical Solutions;  Proposed Organization and Key Personnel, Consultants and Subcontractors (descending order Sub-factors: Project Team Organization, Design-Build Offeror including Key Personnel, Consultants and Sub-contractors including Key Personnel); Management and Scheduling Approach, including Quality Control and Quality Assurance (Sub-factors: General Approach including Team Coordination and Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Proposed Design-Build Schedule and Monitoring of the Schedule, Planning for Project Completion); are significantly more important than Price, however, as proposals become more equal, price becomes more important and may be a determining factor for award.  Additional or Bonus points may be awarded for Technical, and/or Past Performance proposals.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001:  NAICS Code 518210 is hereby changed to NAICS Code 511210, Software Publishers - $21.0, for this requirement.

SCOPE OF REQUIREMENT:  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) intends to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) for the acquisition, maintenance, and technical support of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software to assist the OCC bank examiners with evaluating national banks' compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.  

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.  The CRA analysis software is to be a standalone, Windows compatible application capable of running on a laptop or desktop computer.   At present, OCC computers utilize the Windows 2000 operating system and the Microsoft Office 2000 suite of applications.  

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The CRA analysis software must be modular in structure and must have been designed using professional relational database management system (DBMS) techniques.  It  must allow a bank examiner to import bank data into the DBMS tables and to create queries and reports.  Note:  The bank data may be given to a bank examiner in FFIEC, Excel, DBF, or ASCII Text format.   The software must provide analysis of demographic data (geography, people, housing, and employment/businesses) and aggregate lending data (HMDA and small business) for the entire U.S., including its territories and commonwealths.  It must allow for the export of non-proprietary data.   The software application must be updated on an as needed basis to accommodate changes in the FFIEC file specifications (http://www.ffiec.gov/cra/default.htm) or other OCC/interagency requirements.

SECTION 508:  Standards 1194.21, 1194.22, 1194.31 and 1194.41 are applicable to this requirement.

HOW TO ACQUIRE A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION: OCC anticipates issuing the solicitation at this web site in August, 2004.    The solicitation will contain the details of the requirement, the instructions for submitting a quote, and how the quotes will be evaluated.  

This requirement will be procured using simplified acquisition procedures under the Commercial Item Test Program in FAR 13.5.  All responsible vendors may submit a quote that will be considered by the OCC.  OCC anticipates awarding a contract (with a base year and four option years) in November or December 2004.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION MANAGER as CONTRACTOR (CMc) PROCUREMENT FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF THE EMANUEL CELLER U.S. COURTHOUSE, BROOKLYN, NY.  The General Services Administration (GSA) hereby issues a Pre-Solicitation Notice under which the GSA is publicizing our intention to contract for the Construction Services for the Modernization of the Emanuel Celler United States Courthouse in Brooklyn, NY.  

GSA intends to contract for complete construction services for the modernization of the Emanuel Celler U.S. Courthouse, with general construction contractors (GC) that offer the best overall value to the Government.  The best overall value to the Government includes demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, providing and maintaining a viable team organization and adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.  The existing U.S. Courthouse is an eight-story structure with a gross area of 30,096 square meters (324,000 square feet) and houses district courtrooms, magistrate hearing rooms, court support facilities and other tenants. Currently a new U.S. Courthouse is under construction at this site and will be permanently linked to the existing courthouse.  The Emanuel Celler U.S. Courthouse contains 10 district courtrooms and chambers and 1 special proceedings courtroom, some of which will continue to be utilized by the District Court during construction. The project will include asbestos removal, interior construction, new secured corridors, ceilings and lightings, installation of a building sprinkler system (the building does not have one) and replacement of the fire alarm system, replacement of the roof, repairs to the façade, upgrade of HVAC distribution and electrical systems, modernization of the elevators, window replacement, seismic upgrade and progressive collapse protection, and installation of handicapped accessibility features to meet ADA requirements.  THIS WORK WILL REQUIRE EXTENSIVE PHASING DUE TO THE PARTIAL OCCUPANCY OF THE BUILDING.  

General Contractors interested in submitting a proposal for this project are encouraged to submit a letter of interest. The letter may be sent to the Contracting Officer, Francis Cashman, 271 Cadman Plaza East, 3rd Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11201, via facsimile at (718) 330-2043, or via e-mail to francis.cashman@gsa.gov.  Please contact Mr. Mohammed Abdulghani at (718) 330-2030 for any inquiries. The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for the project is $64,000,000 to $74,000,000.  A Pre-Proposal Conference/Small Business Subcontractor Network Session is set for Thursday, September 9, 2004 at 2:00 pm in the Central Jury Room, Room # 143 at the Emanuel Celler U.S. Courthouse, 225 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, NY 11201.  Any questions that offerors may have concerning the price and technical evaluation criteria will be addressed at the Pre-Proposal Conference.  Any scope changes by the Government that may result from the pre-proposal conference may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for proposal submission at no recompense to the offeror(s).  A Small Business Subcontractor Network Session is scheduled to immediately follow the Pre-Proposal Conference.  The Network Session is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between the community and the firms, which are considering proposing on this project.  Prospective small business subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with potential prime contractors and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors.  

This procurement is being issued under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program, and will be open to both large and small business concerns.  The NAICS code for this project is 236220 with a size standard of $28.5 million.  This project is in and will use Metric Units of Measure.  The general construction contractor selected will be required to supply all labor, materials, supervision and constructability reviews during the A-E's Design Phase to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract.  The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value Trade-off process.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than price.  

The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR 16.2), based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the Offeror that provides the best overall value to the Government.  The primary objective of this process is to select the most technically qualified contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government when all factors including price are considered.  The procurement process will have Two Stages.  

In Stage I, Technical proposals and the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) will be evaluated and the competitive range will be established in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(1). Then, in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(2), based on the results of the evaluation, the Contracting Officer will limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. For this procurement, the competition will be limited to the three (3) most highly rated proposals.  The Technical Factors for Stage One are as follows:  (1) Offeror's Experience on Similar Projects (2) Offeror's Past Performance on Similar Projects and (3) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel.  The submission of price will be simultaneous with the submission of the technical data.  This price should reflect the contractor's Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for General Contractor Services. 

In Stage II the GC’s shall perform construction document reviews and evaluations of the A-E’s Design Phase thru the Design Development Document (DD) Phase and make a technical and price submission.  The Technical Factors for Stage Two are as follows: (1) Construction Document Review with Written Comments (2) Detailed Project Management and Technical Approach and (3) Construction Process/Management Presentation.  The submission of a GMP for the Construction Option will be simultaneous with the submission of the technical data. The offerors must also develop and propose a firm-fixed-price for the Construction Document Review Services through the 100% Completion of all Documents.  Any and all cost saving concepts and scope improvements measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of Stage II become the property of the Government and may be incorporated into the project at no recompense to the offeror.  

In conjunction with the submission of revised technical and price proposals, the offeror is required in accordance with FAR Part 52.219-9 to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan. This mandatory proactive Subcontracting Plan, pursuant to FAR 19.705-4, should encompass the following minimum Socio-Economic Program minimum goals: Small Businesses (48%), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (10%), Women-Owned Small Businesses (7%), Hub Zone Small Businesses (3%), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (3%), and Veteran Owned Small Businesses (4%). The Contractor’s Small Business Subcontracting Plan shall meet the requirements in accordance with FAR 19.704.  The GSA reserves the right to contact agencies, such as the Small Business Administration, to inquire about the offerors past performance regarding small business subcontracting plans/goals.  Information regarding small and small disadvantaged business subcontracting opportunities may be found at the Small Business Administration website: www.sba.gov.

At the end of Stage II, the three (3) most highly rated offerors remaining in the competitive range that fully participated in the competition will be provided a stipend of $50,000 each for their total effort for the services rendered during this stage. At the end of Stage II, the 50% CD Phase, an award will be made to one of the three offerors in the competitive range based on the criteria in the Solicitation.

The selected general contractor (GC) will then participate as a member of the team for the Construction Document Review Services through 100% completion of all documents. The selected general contractor (GC) is to develop a Level 5 Estimate, sufficient to demonstrate the documented value of the Project based on their experience, conversations with their subcontractors and any other means necessary to verify current costing. The estimate will be submitted, in writing, to GSA for their review and consideration and any ideas, problems or information can be utilized to improve the design process. The selected general contractor will submit a list of critical subcontractors. Subcontractors critical to the project including mechanical, electrical, plumbing, roofing, abatement, and fire protection will be asked to participate in this construction document review phase.  Subcontractors will be included in this phase for their technical input and in order to come up with a more accurate firm-fixed price and firm schedule.  All of the critical subcontractors must meet the minimum technical qualifications of the specifications in order to participate.      

The selected general contractor (GC) and the approved critical subcontractors shall participate in 100% & Final Construction Documents, perform a final construction document review with a submission of written comments and participate in all project meetings.  The GC will accept and validate the 100% Construction Documents. The GC must utilize the pricing policy regarding shell and tenant improvements.  GSA pricing policy will be provided to the offerors. Based on the GC’s estimate and any final discussions with the Government, the GC shall provide a firm fixed price for the Construction Phase Option. In conjunction with the submission of the price proposal, the GC is required in accordance with FAR Part 52.219-9 to submit an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan. If GSA determines that the construction option price is reasonable, GSA will exercise the option for the construction of the project and issue Notice to Proceed. Construction duration is approximately 182 weeks or less as mutually accepted after the completion of the construction document review for the 100% completion of all documents. The Option for the Construction Contract will be contingent upon the availability of funds. 

Closing will be at GSA Small Business Utilization Center, 18th Floor; Room 18-110, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY 10278 at 3:00 P.M. Local Time on October 7, 2004, Telephone: (212) 264-1235.

<DESC>Original Presolicitation Notice: The National Park Service (NPS) plans to issue a service contract for the operation and maintenance of the free shuttle bus system, known as the Visitor Transportation System (VTS) in Grand Canyon National Park. The system has been in operation since 1974 with year round operations since 2000. The anticipated change over date to the new contractor is expected to be between 2/1/05 and 3/1/05. Bus drivers and supervisors of the new contractor will be required to attend one week of NPS-provided training prior to the actual changeover date. The contractor will be paid for the operation and maintenance of the Government furnished vehicles based on hourly billing rates for bus drivers and mechanics. The contractor will be reimbursed for the actual cost of repair parts installed. All other contractor expenses (including but not limited to supervision and management staff, utilities, cleaners and fuelers, bookkeepers, equipment and tools, vehicles needed other than visitor transit vehicles) should be included in the contractor's proposed billing rates for bus drivers and mechanics. The contract term will consist of a base period of one year and four one-year option periods. The VTS currently consists of four transit routes, operating from approximately one hour before sunrise to approximately one hour after sunset, with the exception of the Village route that will run later in the evening. The Government furnished vehicles consist of eleven 40' diesel powered buses, nine 40' compressed natural gas (CNG) powered buses, seven 26' liquefied natural gas (LNG) powered buses, one 26' step-van, and ten passenger trailers. The contractor will be the primary user of an LNG and L/CNG fueling station. The NPS plans to have only alternative-fueled buses in the future. The NPS will provide a compound and garage for storage and maintenance. The contractor will be required to adhere to the requirements of the Service Contract Act and the associated Department of Labor wage determinations. It is currently anticipated that a formal solicitation for the above indicated contract will be issued on approximately 8/27/04 and a pre-proposal conference will be held at the site on 9/8/04.

<DESC>Questions and Answers
SFSIAQ-04-R-3011

Question: Does the Department of State (DoS) have a specific format or minimum > requirements for technical specification documents? Or would the vendor's > format be acceptable? 
Answer:  We have an established format, and the technical specifications have already been established via the first two courses that were programmed this year.  Subsequent development will follow the established models.
> 
Question:  Does the DoS have any agency specific SCORM 1.2 and/or Section 508 (of the 1973 Disability Act) compliance specifications? If so, could this information be provided to the offerors before the proposal submission deadline?
Answer: Yes to both questions.  Unfortunately not.

Question: Is the FSI LearnCenter a physical location or virtual entity? Could you expand on the statement "Online learning courses that run in the FSI LearnCenter"? Additionally, are there any technical-oriented specifications for courses that run in the FSI LearnCenter at present?
Answer: FSI LearnCenter is an LMS acquired through learn.com and not customized in any way (other than the graphical interface).  I don't understand the second question.  Yes, there are technical specifications.

Question: Regarding the possibility of contractor personnel potentially having to work some "nights and weekends" (See number 4-Time of Performance in the Task Objective section on Page 12 of the solicitation), is there a rough estimate as to how frequent of an occurrence that would be and how much time per occurrence may be necessary?
Answer:  This occurs only very rarely -- it is stated in order for this to be allowed should the project require it.

Question: Is the DoS's objective, as derived from the purpose to "develop a database for a series of related distributed learning Trade Courses",  to create a database to serve as a SCORM 1.2 compliant Learning Management System (LMS) in conjunction with the online course development?  Or is there a LMS in use and the courses would need to be integrated into the existing LMS?  Are there any specifications available if the latter scenario applies to this project?
Answer:  The latter applies.  FSI LearnCenter is learn.com's LMS product.

Question: The DoS provides that "The application will be written against SQL Server 2000. The client's desktops are Windows 2000."  Could the DoS also provide information regarding the web browsers, including versions, in use at DoS?  Is there a desktop minimum system requirement specification in place that would serve as the platform basis for design purposes?  (Some advanced web technologies rely on the availability of certain web browser versions or higher.)
Answer: The course must run in IE 5.5 or higher, minimum desktop requirement is Pentium III.

Question: Are there any web technologies, such as Macromedia Flash Player, that are prohibited or restricted in use per DoS policies and standards?  Would any browser plug-ins be allowed?

Answer: No browser plug-ins will be allowed in this course.  I believe the RFP specifies the acceptable programming languages.

Question:  The RFQ indicates the place of performance will be the FSI in Arlington, VA.  Does this mean that all development and testing hardware and software will be provided by the DoS?  Will the offeror have any input in the selection of development and testing hardware and software?
Answer:  All hardware and software will be provided, and the offeror has no input in the hardware.

Question: Will the DoS IRM IT support infrastructure provide technical assistance and maintenance services for the project development environment?  Will there be a liaison between project staff and IRM staff?
Answer: Absolutely -- the project staff will work within the IRM team.

Question:  Does the Foreign Service Institute currently using any Learning Management System(LMS) for the courseware?
Answer:  FSI LearnCenter is learn.com's LMS product.

Question:  Are current existing courseware that are MS SQL Server 2000 based?  What are the technical specifications for the current courseware? 
Answer:  Yes.  The course must run in IE 5.5 or higher, minimum desktop requirement is Pentium III.

Question:  What are the Foreign Service Institute guidelines and standards for courseware development that are applicable to this contract/requirement?
Answer:  In general terms, they are already stated in the RFP.

Question:  What are the hours on Page 3 of 16 for the multimedia programmer and graphic designer based on?
Answer:  Current workload analysis

Question:  What is the size standard for this contract?    Is this a 6 mil or 21
mil? 
Answer:  The size standard is 541512 at $21.0 million.

Question: Does the Foreign Service Institute currently using any Learning Management System(LMS) for the courseware?
Answer:  FSI LearnCenter is learn.com's LMS product.



Question:  May we submit both government and non-government examples of past performance?
Answer: Yes.
Question:   Will any special consideration be given to 8(a), woman-owned SDBs?
Answer:  This is a small business set-aside.
Question:   Is there an incumbent? If so, who is the incumbent? 
Answer:  Dys-Tech
Question:   Can you provide a list of all interested bidders?
Answer:   No.  Solicitation is posted online for anyone interested to bid on.
Question:   In the list of Essential Personnel, there is no mention of an instructional systems designer, or any personnel with ISD experience. In our extensive experience with ILT-to-WBT conversion, there is a strong need for instructional design expertise to ensure the creation and fulfillment of instructional objectives, which often change when conducting such a conversion. The essential personnel listed focus exclusively on the programming and design aspects, and do not address the development or modification of content, which is critical to the success of the project. How will this need be fulfilled to ensure the creation of performance-based, instructionally sound deliverables? 
Answer:   We have in-house ISD staff who will work with the programmer and graphics designer.

Question:   The typical ratio for ILT-to-WBT conversion is 3:1. That is, 3 hours of ILT typically convert to 1 hour of WBT. Knowing the length of the current ILT will enable us to accurately assess the final amount of seat time in the WBT. Can you provide an estimate of the number of ILT hours we will need to convert?  
Answer:  No - the current, week-long face-to-face course is undergoing radical change as we convert the content to a series of mini-courses.  This RFP is for one or more of those mini-courses.  We have calculated the conversion based on our knowledge of the Government requirements.

<CONTACT>JOANNE  LOWE CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487392     JLOWE@USGS.GOV;
<DESC>The US Geological Survey has a need to connect to the Next Generation Internet exchange, D.C. (NGIX,D.C.) and to Internet2's Abilene network.  The NGIX is an electronic meeting place for a large number of federal networks that USGS has a need to collaborate with.  The Abilene network, operated by the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (UCAID), is a world wide network of higher education universities, research networks, and non-profit research entities for which USGS needs connectivity to for research collaborations.  The sole middle Atlantic connection point for the NGIX and UCAID connector is at the Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (MAX) located at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland.  A single connection to MAX serves to carry both the NGIX and the Internet2 Abilene traffic.  The USGS requires a 155 megabit per second connection to accommodate the combination of NGIX and Internet 2 traffic. The University of Maryland is the only source of access to the Mid-Atlantic Crossroads.  Due to this limited availability, this requirement will be met through a sole source contract for one base year and four option years with the University of Maryland.  This service will be utilized by the USGS scientific community for collaborative information exchanges with other scientific and research organizations.  Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 ( c ) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the government considers the service specified as a sole source from the University of Maryland.  Should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required service are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and other information/material which corresponds to the requirement.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  This notice represents the Governments only official notice for this procurement.  This is not a commercial item procurement, see numbered note 26.  Also, see number note 22. NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541618.

<ARCHDATE>12312005
<CONTACT>XDS13-12 (540) 653-7765
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is publicizing this  sources sought announcement for a competitive set-aside acquisition pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637 (a)) to determine prospective 8(a) businesses capable of providing Scientific and Engineering Support for Directed Energy Technology Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) for NSWCDD Code B20.  In the event that no 8(a) small businesses are determined to be capable of providing this support, this acquisition will be solicited as a small business set-aside. This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. Overview:  NSWCDD directed energy support encompassed within this sources sought is focused on high power microwave (HPM) / radio frequency (RF) and high energy laser (HEL) technologies with the objective to improve the Navy’s near- and far-term airborne, surface, subsurface, and space warfare capabilities through the utilization of this transformational technology.  With advances in reliant technologies and Navy interest in the all-electric ship concept, directed energy technologies are beginning to be considered for an increased role to satisfy Navy mission requirements in both blue water and littoral environments.  The application of advanced directed energy technologies will be tested with hardware based upon foundational research and development characterized by “hands-on” prototyping made possible through theoretical calculations, laboratory experimentation, and computerized modeling and simulation.  The technologies will then be assessed with static and dynamic labora! tory and field tests to demonstrate potential feasibility.  To be considered a potential source, the contractor must be able to provide scientific and engineering support for the design, test, and performance evaluation of HPM / RF systems and subsystems, and HEL lethality design, test, and performance evaluation to support blue water and littoral missions for the Navy.  Labor Requirements:  The current labor support required as part of this sources sought can be categorized as 80% HPM / RF-related and 20% HEL related.  This percentage is expected to remain equivalent for the near-term.  Specific contractor personnel support should include, but not be limited to, the following full-time equivalent areas of expertise (manning levels to be used for initial planning purposes only are annotated in parenthesis): senior HPM / RF / pulse power engineer (1); senior HPM / RF / pulse power electronics technician (2); mid-level HPM / RF / pulse power engineer (2); mid-level HPM / RF / ! pulse power electronics technician (3); mid-level senior electromagnetic modeling and simulation physicist / engineer (2); senior electro-optics / laser engineer (1); mid-level electro-optics / laser technician (2); mid-level mechanical engineer (1); mid-level network and computing engineer (1).  Task Requirements:  The contractor tasks shall provide support to NSWCDD technicians, scientists, and engineers in various task areas to include threat analysis, system analysis, RF / HEL systems design and development, RF / HEL system test and evaluation, automated data collection and analysis, physics-based computer modeling and simulation design and development, and setup / maintenance / operations of both indoor laboratories and outdoors experimental test ranges.  Support of unique expertise associated with the development and analyses of directed energy technologies may be needed.  Evaluation of candidate system and subsystem performance analyses will be conducted in both stati! c and dynamic laboratory and field site environments, as well as the development of system models and computerized simulation capabilities in order to evaluate performance in a cost-effective manner.  The evaluation of various system performance techniques will require the use and development of specialized commercial and custom devices, technologies, and methods, to include applications in the areas of RF / HEL sources, calibration equipment and facilities, high-bandwidth electromagnetically tolerant diagnostic instrumentation, software and hardware based data acquisition systems, and high-speed image acquisition and processing systems.  The contractor shall calibrate, operate, and maintain these complex devices, systems, and facilities and perform detailed data reduction and analysis.  The contractor shall assist with the selection, development, and integration of measurement platforms.  Field exercises could be conducted in a variety of international locations, but the ma! jority will be located within the continental United States.  Virtually all of the support contractor personnel work tasks are expected to be conducted on-site at NSWCDD, Dahlgren VA.  The contractor shall provide technical and engineering support for the evaluation of emerging technologies for potential systems and subsystems.  The contractor shall participate in test planning and utilize computerized simulation capabilities to predict testing outcomes.  The contractor shall provide technical and engineering support in the analysis of test results, support technical evaluation of the test results, and report on the test results.  The contractor shall provide technical and system engineering support for analyses and investigations, and provide input to NSWCDD to support the preparation and updating of program documentation.  This includes analysis of proposed system or equipment changes; recommended changes to documentation; and analysis of technical, operational, cost, risk! , and schedule factors in support of program reporting requirements.  The contractor will need to acquire some hardware (with the Government providing the remainder), as well as design and fabricate components and subsystems required to conduct the assigned tasks.  The hardware required for supporting test and evaluation tasks shall include data acquisition and storage systems as well as electrical or mechanical fixtures to interface system or test equipment to land, ship, or airborne platforms.  For planning purposes, the approximate percentage of tasks assigned with this contract is two-thirds services-related and one-third hardware-related.  The contractor shall be required to operate in specialized classified environments that require security clearances up to the Top Secret level.  Scope of Effort:  The contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (term and completion) pricing arrangement with a period of p! erformance of five (5) years comprised of approximately fifteen (15) man-years total.  Work is planned to begin in February 2005.

This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.     The U.S. Army Tank-automotive & Armaments Command (TACOM) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of light tactical vehicles, comprised of six (6) variants (description of each is attached), which will supply the Afghan National Army (A NA).  Maximum commonalities between the six variants as well as durability for rough, mountainous terrain and climate of the country of Afghanistan are crucial factors that will be considered as part of the selection process.  An urgent delivery schedule o f starting shipment of 400 of the Cargo Transport vehicles by April 2005 to country is a firm requirement.  A five-year, firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type-contract will be issued.  Shipping terms will be Free-on-Board: Or igin.  One contract award will be made (ALL OR NONE).  The Government is estimating the target award unit price to be approximately $30,000.  OperatorÃ¢Â€Â™s manuals will need to be provided in English as well as translated into the language of Dari (Afgha n Persian). The purpose of the survey is to assist in determining what commercial vehicles are available immediately which meet our needs, and possibly what Non-Developmental Items (NDIs) are currently available or could be available in the April 2005 timeframe.  For planning purposes, a contract is targeted for award in December, 2004. [As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), a commercial item is (1) Any item, other than real property, that is of a type customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities for purposes other than governmental purposes, an d--(1) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public; or, (2) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public; (2) Any item that evolved from an item described in paragraph (1) of this definition through advances in technology  or performance and that is not yet available in the commercial marketplace, but will be available in the commercial marketplace in time to satisfy the delivery requirements under a Government solicitation; (3) Any item that would satisfy a criterion expre ssed in paragraphs (1) or (2) of this definition, but for (i) Modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace; or (ii) Minor modifications of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Go vernment requirements. Minor modifications mean modifications that do not significantly alter the nongovernmental function or essential physical characteristics of an item or component, or change the purpose of a process. Factors to be considered in determ ining whether a modification is minor include the value and size of the modification and the comparative value and size of the final product. Dollar values and percentages may be used as guideposts, but are not conclusive evidence that a modification is mi nor. FAR defines a non-developmental item as follows:   a.   any previously developed item used exclusively for governmental purposes by a Federal agency, a State or local government, or a foreign government with which the U.S. has a mutual defense cooperation agreement.   b.   Any item described in paragraph a., above, that requires only minor modification to meet the requirements of the procuring agency.   c.   Any item currently being produced that d oes not meet the requirement of paragraphs a or b, above, solely because the item is not yet in use.]   Your responses will assist in finalizing plans for this effort and allow better definition of requirements, thereby providing a more clearly written solicitation to industry.   The government will not reimburse contractors for any costs incurred as a resul t of their participation in this survey.   ** Submit survey documentation by email AS WELL AS a printed hard copy no later than August 20, 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time, to: * rybicksc@tacom.army.mil                 AND * Material Acquisition Group, ATTN:  AMSTA-AQ-ADB, Mr. Scott Rybicki, MS 326, 6501 E. 11 Mile Road, Warren, MI 48397-5000,  All survey documentation must be in English.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, is seeking a commercial solution to meet our customerÃ¢Â€Â™s needs for Demolition and Deconstruction Services at various Army Installations. The ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s Installation Management Agency (IMA ) is responsible for providing equitable, effective and efficient management of Army installations worldwide.  IMA is divided into seven geographic regions encompassing the continental United States as well as the Pacific, Europe and Korea. Services are be ing sought primarily for IMAÃ¢Â€Â™s Northeast Region (ME, NH, VT, MA, CT, RI, NY, NJ, DE, PA, MD, WV and VA).  On occasion, services may be requested for government facilities within the other continental US regions.  Among the many Army-wide programs assi gned to IMA, the Facility Reduction Program (FRP) eliminates excess facilities and infrastructure which reduces fixed installation costs.  Contractor services are being sought to provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment and labor necessary to pla n and perform demolition and/or deconstruction services in accordance with all federal, state and local applicable laws.  Scope of work could include: planning for and carrying out demolition (or deconstruction) of an undetermined amount of various governm ent buildings, structures and facilities, and removal and transport of construction debris, asbestos and/or lead based paint.  Debris reduction through recycling, debris processing, etc., will be a major consideration.  Demolition of buildings and structur es inherently effects the local environment. Local regulations will be identified. The Government shall provide information that relates to hazardous material and environmental protection regulations at each base.  Businesses that have the ability to meet this specific requirement are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to include the following information:  detailed information on how the work will be accomplished; availability and description of equipment and labor, and rough order of mag nitude.  Businesses that have the ability to meet this specific requirement are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to include the following information:  detailed information on how the work will be accomplished; equipment availability, e quipment description and rough order of magnitude.  Responses or questions are to be sent by email to kathy.r.wallace@hnd01.usace.army.mil.  Written responses are due by 27 Aug 2004.

<SUBJECT>R -- Provide Technical assistance, training and commodities to strengthen the justice sector in Colombia
<DESC>USAID/Colombia intends to award a Sole Source modification to Checchi and Company Consulting, Inc. under Contract No. 514-C-00-01-00113-00. The estimated amount of this modification is US$2,784,666.00. The above Contract was awarded to Checchi and Company Consulting, Inc. on a full and open competition basis on April 6, 2001 and the estimated completion date is September 30, 2005. The total estimated contract amount is US$24,997,772.00. 
The purpose of the above contract is to provide technical assistance, training and commodities to strengthen the justice sector in Colombia.  In support of Colombia’s transition to an oral, accusatorial justice system ten oral trial courtrooms need to be constructed and equipped in addition to more than 20 that have been provided under an existing contract with Checchi and Co.   The purpose of this modification is to support Colombians’ access to the justice system. The contractor shall establish two additional community-based Justice Houses and re-habilitate another four by providing assistance to include remodeling buildings, furnishing offices and installing computer equipment and providing technical training for Justice House staff.  Concurrently, USAID requests that a dissemination strategy be developed and implemented to generate community and especially minority awareness of reforms to increase public understanding of justice reforms and demand for the Justice House services in the communities targeted for assistance.
USAID intends to negotiate this modification with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5), where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays. The required services include continuation and expansion of services of the same nature as described in the original statement of work of the original contract. 
This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement in accordance with numbered note 22. Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The total estimated contract amount is US$27,400,948.00. 
The purpose of the above contract is to provide technical assistance, training and small infrastructure grant support to municipal governments in Colombia in USAID-identified strategic regions.

Additionally, at the request of the United States Congress, activities under the existing Legislative Strengthening Program will be expanded to focus on Afro-Colombian groups, and to initiate new limited activities in the Valle de Cauca.  
USAID intends to negotiate this modification with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5), where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays.

<SUBJECT>R -- Provide technical assistance, training and policy advice in support of human rights in Colombia
<DESC>USAID/Colombia intends to award a Sole Source modification to MSD, Inc. under Contract No. 514-C-00-01-00102-00. The estimated amount of this modification is US$$2,125,000.00. The above Contract was awarded to MSD, Inc. on a full and open competition basis on March 27, 2001 and the estimated completion date is March 27, 2006. The total estimated contract amount is US$31,893,152.00. 
The purpose of the above contract is to provide technical assistance, training and policy advice in support of human rights in Colombia.  The purpose of this modification is to provide additional resources which will be applied to the initiation of assistance to the Government of Colombia and Procuraduría pursuant to MOUs that USAID/Colombia has signed with these entities.  These activities will be based on work done to date under an existing USAID/Colombia contract with Management Sciences for Development (MSD).  
USAID intends to negotiate this modification with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5), where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays. The required services include continuation and expansion of services of the same nature as described in the original statement of work of the original contract. 
This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement in accordance with numbered note 22. Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>15 -- C-130 Center Wing box
<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE

C-130 Center Wing Replacement Modification Program Industry Day
This is a request for industry day and not a solicitation.

INTRODUCTION:

The Government is planning an industry day on 14 September 2004, from 0800-1700, at the Museum of Aviation, Eagle Conference Room, Warner Robins, GA to obtain information concerning the C-130 Center Wing (CW) Modification Program.  The industry Day is intended to encourage free-flowing dialogue between the Government and Industry.  The government will provide information on the C-130 CW Program, share its ideas on acquisition strategy and highlight the requirement for the work to be planned and accomplished during the initial effort.  The government will then solicit feedback and recommendations in order to help refine the acquisition strategy.

In conjunction with the Industry Day, 45-minute one-on-one Question and Answer (only) sessions with interested parties will be held 14 September 2004, from 1200-1700, at the Museum of Aviation.  The number of sessions will be limited and will be on a first-come, first-serve basis.  If your company is interested in scheduling a one-on-one session, please make your request at the same time you notify the Government of your intention to attend Industry Day.

Attendance for the one-on-one Q&A sessions is limited to 5 people per entity/team.  All parties planning to attend Industry day are required to send an email notification to Mr. Terrence M. (Mike) Brown at mike.brown@robins.af.mil no later than 8 September 2004.  Please include the names, company affiliation, phone number and email address of the attendees, plus your company’s request for a one-on-one session with the Government.

NOTE:  THIS SPECIAL NOTICE IS PART OF MARKET RESERCH ONLY: IT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, REQUEST FOR QUOTATION, OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE SUCH A REQUEST OR INVITATION.  INDUSTRY DAY PARTICIPATION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY REIMBURSTMENT OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION/PRESENTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH INDUSTRY DAY. 


SCOPE:

This industry day is directed to competitive potential prime contractors who have demonstrated experience in the design, development, and manufacture of major aircraft (A/C) structures on the same scale as a C-130 center wing box.  The Government will use the information gathered from the industry day for the development of the C-130 CW Program.  Further, this information will help the Government structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule and performance risks.  

REQUIREMENTS:

This program includes efforts to design, develop, and manufacture the C-130 Center Wing (CW).  The Government has determined the need to replace the existing C-130 CW on AC-130U, HC-130N/P, C-130E, C-130H, and C-130K model A/C. Fifty (50) CW kits will be purchased and then installed at the depot starting in FY11 through FY23. This is a build to print acquisition.  All manufactures that design and build the C-130 CW must have a Federal Aviation Administration certificate that certifies the company to design and build equipment that will be used on airborne aircraft. The manufacturer must also comply with all military specifications on material used in the system. Upon completion of the effort all designs, drawings and proprietary rights to the project will be relinquished and turned over to the United States Air Force in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.227-14 as prescribed at FAR 27.409(a).

OBJECTIVES:
.The contractor shall deliver CW assemblies as part of a complete installation kit including the CW box, trailing edges, flap tracks, bladders (unfitted), wing attach angles, truss mounts, and all hardware and plumbing. The major CW box components consist of upper surface panels, upper surface stringers, upper surface rainbow fittings, lower surface panels, lower surface stringers, lower surface rainbow fittings, and the front and rear beams.  The CW kit measures approximately 3’X16’X40’ (basic dimensions) and weighs approximately 9,500 pounds.
·	The contractor shall manufacture CW installation kits meeting fit, form, and function and weight requirements for aforementioned in-service A/C.  The contractor is responsible for ensuring there are no discrepancies between the assembly/fabrication drawings supplied and the actual assemblies to be installed on the A/C.
·	The contractor shall manufacture CW installation kits subject to the latest ISO 9000 family of standards, guidelines and technical reports.
·	The contractor shall verify fit, form, and function requirements by component and assembly first article submissions and trial installation of the CW kit on an A/C.  Contractor shall provide technical support during trial kit installation.
·	The contractor shall be responsible for all Non-recurring Engineering (NRE) cost and shall provide a technical data package (i.e. drawing associated with tooling) resulting from NRE (See FAR statement under the above requirements paragraph).
·	The Department of Defense (DoD) will not provide production tooling or facilities for manufacturing purposes.
·	The contractor shall possess capability to develop or to obtain tooling and to manufacture critical CW box components while maintaining typical 1 degree angular, .010 inches with .XXX decimal tolerances, and four-decimal place hole tolerances.  
·	The contractor shall possess 5-axis machining capability to machine compound contoured critical CW box components.
·	The contractor shall possess the ability to manufacture or obtain complex critical components made from aluminum, stainless steel, and titanium alloys as sheet, plate, and bar stock, extrusions, castings, and forgings.
·	The contractor shall possess the capability to machine components measuring 440 inches in length while maintaining a maximum of .004 inches machining mismatch and a maximum of .25 inches of deviation from loft over the entire part length.
·	The contractor shall produce deliverables just in time to meet installation schedule requirements beginning October 2010.
·	Ultimately, the feasibility of design and manufacturing the C-130 CW will be determined by cost and manufacturing capability.
o	For your C-130 CW approach, what capabilities and/or components are expected to be major contributors to the cost?
o	What are the proposed techniques/methods for controlling production costs?
o	What are your current manufacturing capabilities as they relate to the C-130 CW replacement program?

<SUBJECT>R--TRANSFORMING THE PRIVATE SECTOR ROLE IN SPACE OPERATIONS
<DESC>The President’s Commission on Implementation of U.S. Space Exploration Policy forwarded its report “A Journey to Inspire, Innovate, and Discover” to the President on June 4, 2004. In that report, the Commission made a number of recommendations concerning the future missions and structure of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  The report can be viewed electronically at  http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/60736main_M2M_report_small_pdf	. The Commission stated directly that for the nation’s space exploration journey to succeed, it must be (1) sustainable over several decades; (2) affordable with available resources; and (3) credible in the stewardship of taxpayer dollars. The Commission recommended: “. . . NASA recognize and implement a far larger presence of private industry in space operations with the specific goal of allowing private industry to assume the primary role of providing services to NASA, and most immediately in accessing low-Earth orbit.  In NASA decisions, the preferred choice for operational activities must be competitively awarded contracts with private and non-profit organizations and NASA’s role must be limited to only those areas where there is irrefutable demonstration that only government can perform the proposed activity.” One step to foster these goals would be to have operational activities done to the greatest extent possible by the private sector.  This will allow the private sector to bring its expertise to bear on those matters while NASA focuses on cutting edge research, development and exploration. For this Request for Information (RFI), NASA is interested in receiving comments and ideas from all sources regarding possible ways of implementing the Commission’s recommendation except for the area of commercial transportation services, which is being addressed under a separate RFI. Questions concerning this RFI may be submitted via email no later than August 27, 2004, 5:00 PM EDT to Rodney Liesveld at rodney.liesveld@nasa.gov. Responses to this RFI and call for comments and ideas may lead to a decision to compete study contracts or other follow-on work to implement this recommendation.  Responses to this RFI should be sent to the address shown below. Responses are due September 13, 2004. Respondents shall provide an electronic submission to the email address given above in addition to the hard copy submission. Responses are limited to 20 pages. An executive summary shall be included as part of your 20-page response.  Mr. William F. Readdy  Associate Administrator  Office of Space Operations NASA Headquarters  300 E Street SW  Washington, D.C. 20546  This document is for information and planning purposes. This document is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents will not be notified of the results.

<SUBJECT>R--EXPANDED USE OF NASA CONTRACTUAL  AUTHORITY TO OBTAIN IDEAS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND MANAGEMENT TOOLS FOR ACCOMPLISHING SPACE EXPLORATION GOALS
<DESC>The President’s Commission on Implementation of U.S. Space Exploration Policy forwarded its report “A Journey to Inspire, Innovate, and Discover” to the President on June 4, 2004. In that report, the Commission made a number of recommendations concerning the future missions and structure of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  The report can be viewed electronically at  http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/60736main_M2M_report_small_pdf	. In Recommendation 5-1, the Commission recommends NASA aggressively use its contractual authority to reach broadly into the commercial and nonprofit communities to bring the best ideas, technologies, and management tools into the accomplishment of exploration goals. The Commission noted that if the Vision for Space Exploration is to succeed in an affordable, credible and sustainable way, it must access as much private sector technology as possible. The Commission also stated that an increase in the number and variety of commercial companies working in the field of space would vastly increase the processes and materials available for space exploration. The Commission spoke favorably of mechanisms to encourage private sector involvement in space such as prizes, tax incentives, regulatory relief, and settlement of property rights in space.  NASA is interested in receiving comments and ideas from all sources regarding possible effective and efficient steps that may be taken to implement this recommendation.  Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) and ideas may lead to a decision to compete study contracts or other follow-on work to implement this recommendation.  Questions concerning this RFI may be submitted via email no later than August 27, 2004, 5:00 PM EDT to Mr. L. W. Bailets at lbailets@nasa.gov.

Introduction
The Department of Defense (DoD) initiated WAWF-RA to eliminate paper transactions from the contracting process.  The purpose of WAWF-RA is to enable vendors and government officials to electronically access and process the documentation needed to generate payment for goods and services.  Once your computer is set-up, registration, and training are completed, invoices will be created and processed in WAWF-RA.  WAWF-RA is mandated by DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement clause 252.232-7003 "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests", dated March 2003, which is incorporated in this purchase order.  The following information will help you get started.

Setting Up Your Computer
To set up your computer go to https://wawf.eb.mil and select the hyperlink on the left-hand side of the page entitled “About WAWF-RA”.  An expanded list will appear.  Select "Setting Up Your Machine".  This page will list all computer, software, and security requirements.  All necessary programs can be downloaded from this page.  Your computer must be configured properly to use WAWF-RA.  Once your computer is set up you may proceed to the registration process.

Registration
For help with the registration process go to  to https://wawf.eb.mil and select the hyperlink "Help with registration for access to WAWF-RA" in the center of your screen.  On the next page go towards the bottom and select the hyperlink under the "Vendors" section.  Be sure to list an Electronic Business Point of Contact in the Central Contractor Registry.  This information must be current to process an invoice in WAWF-RA and can be updated by going to www.ccr.gov.  Once you are ready to register go to https://wawf.eb.mil and select the hyperlink "Self Register to use WAWF-RA (New users)*" then follow the directions.  Upon activation of your account, usually within 2 business days, you will receive notification via email.  Prior to logging on to WAWF-RA, users are strongly encouraged to complete the computer-based training. 

Training
Training can be accessed by going to http://www.wawftraining.com/.  Be sure that your computer meets the minimum requirements listed on this page.  Users must register prior to starting the training.  This registration is separate from the registration process for the WAWF-RA system.  Be aware that this computer-based training is made for all users of WAWF-RA, not just vendors, so be sure to focus on the vendor portion of the training.  Once training is completed users may begin to use the system. 

Invoice Processing
When creating an invoice be sure to select the "Invoice and Receiving Report Combo" document type, not the “Invoice” or “Invoice as 2 in 1 (Services Only)” type.  Once the proper document type is selected you will be asked to indicate the location for inspection and acceptance.  Both must be coded as “Destination”.  

THE FOLLOWING CODES WILL BE REQUIRED TO ROUTE YOUR INVOICES AND ADDITIONAL EMAILS CORRECTLY THROUGH WAWF.

LOCAL CLAUSE:  State and Local Tax Immunity

STATEMENT OF WORK

REQUIREMENTS:  The Ball Transfer Conveyor (BTC) System shall be used to transfer 463L pallet loads.  The conveyors shall consist of ball transfers, structural frames, and all other equipment, material, and devices as necessary for pallet transfer to conform to the requirements specified herein.

PHYSICAL AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:

LOAD CAPACITY:  The BTC shall be designed to easily convey 463L pallets weighting from ranges of fully loaded to empty.

DEFORMATION UNDER IMPACT:  All conveyor frames, bearings, and ball transfers shall be capable of withstanding repeated impacts from on/off-loading and transfer of fully loaded pallets without suffering any permanent deformation.

CONVEYOR LEVELNESS:  The BTC shall be level along its entire length and width.  The conveying surface of all ball transfers shall be level to within one-eight-inch over 10 feet measured along the length and width of the conveyor.  The BTC shall provide a smooth surface for transporting palletized loads.

BTC INTERFACES:  Pallets shall not snag or bind at interfaces between conveyor frames.  The BTC shall be designed and installed to interface with the Gravity Roller Conveyor (GRC).

MANUAL OPERATION:  The system shall be designed so that three people can manually transfer a fully loaded 463L pallet over the BTC system in both the directions.  The force required to start and maintain pallet movement or pallet rotation shall not exceed 25 pounds per 1000 pounds of load.  The force shall be applied 48-inches above the conveying surface at the edge of the pallet.  All ball transfers shall rotate freely for manual transfer.  BTC shall provide smooth, easy manual transfer, right-angle transfer, and rotation of pallets in any direction.

TRANSFER:  Pallets shall be able to be transferred at a right angle at any point along the BTC.  Pallets shall be able to be rotated 360 degrees at the center of the BTC.  The BTC shall allow pallets to be pushed onto the gravity roller conveyor specified herein.

BALL TRANSFERS:  The design of the BTC shall be approved by the COR prior to fabrication.  Ball transfers shall consist of a housing containing a minimum one-inch diameter ball.  The main ball and all supporting balls shall be stainless steel.  Other metal components of the ball transfer shall be stainless steel, aluminum, or zinc plated.  The ball transfers shall not corrode, rut, or deteriorate due to moisture.  Ball transfers shall be shielded against contamination.  Each ball transfer shall have a minimum load capacity of 375 pounds.  The conveying surface shall extend a minimum of one-fourth inch above the tread plate and shall be level with the conveying surface of the gravity roller conveyor.  Ball transfers shall be spaced a maximum of 8 inches apart.  Ball transfers and the spacing used shall not damage pallets stored or transferred on the conveying surface.  The ball transfer shall be replaceable.  The ball transfers shall be retained in place such that they do not leave the frame during normal operation.

FRAMES:  The ball transfer frames shall be constructed of structural steel and shall support all loads without permanent deformation.  The frame shall be anchored to the floor on maximum five-foot centers.  The height of the ball transfer conveyor shall be designed to interface with the Gravity Roller Conveyors.

SHIMS:  As a minimum, the conveyor frames shall be shimmed at each anchor point and at all interface points between conveyor frames to ensure a smooth transition between conveying surfaces.  Shims shall be utilized so that the conveyor frames do not have an unsupported length greater than five feet.  The shims shall be held in place by the anchor bolt.  Shim holes shall be punched or drilled.  Slotted shims shall not be acceptable.  Beveled or half-shims shall be provided where required to ensure that each conveyor frame is level.  The guide rails need only be shimmed to the point where they extend a minimum of one and one-half-inches above the conveyor frames along the entire length of the conveyor.  Shims shall be equal in width to the width of the component under which it is installed (either the conveyor support or the guide rail) and shall be aligned beneath the component.  Each shim shall be a minimum of 4 inches in length.  Shims shall be of sufficient varying thicknesses so that no more than five shims are installed at any point.

TREAD PLATES:  A metal tread plate shall be provided between all ball transfers.  All tread plates shall form a single integral surface that shall provide a safe walking surface for personnel who manually transfer the pallets.  The tread plates shall be a minimum of one-eight-inch structural steel.  All tread plates shall provide a non-skid surface with high traction even when wet due to condensation.  Holes for the ball transfers shall not provide a gap between the ball transfer and the tread plate of more than one-eight-inch.  The tread plates shall be sized to be easily removable by one person.  Welding of the tread plate to the conveyor frame shall not be acceptable.  The tread plates shall be fastened to the conveyor frame with recessed-head bolts that shall not present a tripping or snagging hazard.

FOOT RAMPS:  Foot ramps shall be provided at all staging lane interfaces as shown on the drawings.  The ramps shall be designed with non-skid structural steel shapes and forms rigidly welded and reinforced to withstand repeated impacts of a 250-pound person.  The ramps shall provide a smooth transition from the ball transfer deck to and from the concrete floor slab.

STEEL SKIRTS:  A steel skirt shall extend from the tread plate surface to within one-half-inch of the floor on all exposed sides of the conveyor, including the door interface.  The skirt and conveyor frame may be combined and installed as a single unit.

SIDE GUIDES:  The BTC shall have side guides parallel to the conveying direction.  Side guides shall extend a minimum of two-and-one-half inches above the conveying surface.  Side guides at interface points between separate frames shall have a rounded lead-in surface to prevent snagging of the pallets and loads.

SPARE PARTS:  Spare ball transfer shall be provided as part of the conveyor system.  The number of spare ball transfer units provided shall be one percent of the number of units in the system, rounded up to the next integer.

14.  VEHICLE INSPECTIONS.  Two (2) technical inspections will be made of each vehicle rental ordered hereunder.

Written document shall be generated, in duplicate, that itemizes any and all visible dents, dings, scratches or other damage and/or defects, as well as, providing an overall assessment of the operational condition of the rental vehicle.  This document or "inspection checklist" shall be signed by both inspecting parties and constitutes testament of the condition of vehicle rental at the time of delivery or pick-up by the Government.  The documentation used for this purpose shall be provided by the Contractor and shall be standard commercial type forms or reports.  The amount of fuel present shall be noted.  The mileage shown on the odometer shall be recorded for informational purposes only.

15.  A second technical inspection shall be conducted jointly by the Contractor and the Government representative at the time vehicle rentals are picked-up, recovered or dropped-off.

Procedure shall follow that of the delivery inspection.  Copies of this documentation shall accompany invoices.  This document or "inspection checklist" shall be signed by both inspecting parties as testament of the condition of the rental vehicle at the time of return.  The document(s) used for this purpose may be the same document used for delivery, so long as, the functions of delivery or pick-up are distinct and easily discernable from that of return or drop-off of the effected vehicle rental.  The Government shall ensure an equal amount of fuel is present at return as was recorded at acceptance.  In the event the Government fails to do so, the Contractor agrees any charges to replace missing fuel shall be separate and apart from this contract, and is to be to coordinate directly with the Government representative to make arrangement for payment of these charges by Government Credit Card.

Statement of Need
 for AFPC/DPC
 Mentoring Training

Purpose Statement:  The face and focus of our work centers are constantly evolving.  This evolution makes the Mentoring Program even more important.  We need to develop employees through a mentorship framework that will provide an avenue for them to reach their greatest potential.  The mentorship program is  a three pronged approach of leadership development, training, and education.  Mentor and Mentee jointly develop a “career path” for career advancement by not only nurturing the employee, but also ensuring a shared understanding of the mission and the organization’s future.   The mentor and mentee will jointly structure their own relationship.  The training sessions should be an avenue for the mentor and mentee to learn or fine tune their respective rolls; interact with other employees involved in similar endeavors; and learn the necessary skills that will enhance the mentorship process. The attached “Framework for the DPC Mentorship Program,” will provide more background on the AFPC/DPC Program.  The list of suggested topics below is a basic structure.  We will consider other topic suggestions with all course structure and content approved by Kimberly Litherland, our technical point of contact.
 
Audience:  Approximately 8 mentors & 26 mentees will be selected and matched.

Framework for the 
DPC MENTORSHIP PROGRAM

DPC GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: 
	Develop employees through a mentorship framework that helps employees reach their greatest potential through leadership development, training, and education.  A program that seeks to develop a structured “career path” that affords employees an opportunity to seek career advancement.  A program that nurtures employees through mentoring, ensuring a shared understanding of our mission and where we are headed.  Mentoring relationships can be highly structured – short term, highly structured – long term, informal – short term, informal – long term; DPC will not dictate to each mentor/mentored employee how “structured” their particular relationship will be.       

APPLICABILITY:  Voluntary program which applies to all DPC employees to include Palace Acquire (PAQ) Interns and Students (STEPs and SCEPs).  Interested employees will complete the DPC Mentorship Program Application Form.  Several panels (Mr Huerta, Ms Lee McGehee, and Division Chiefs) will review all applications,  conduct one-on-one interviews with each, and make appropriate “mentorship track” assignments.  

RATIONALE:  Mentorship Program will be open to all employees who wish to participate.  A great source of our future specialists/leaders lies in our clerical/assistant ranks.  We create vacancies at the lowest level, hire the right individuals, and then mentor them so they are prepared for the jobs we need them to be in 10 years from now (similar to approach taken for AF PAQs). 

However, not all employees will be interested in mentorship leading to AF-wide potential.  Some employees are not mobile and will want to remain here, at the Personnel Center.  Therefore, two different mentorship tracks will be developed targeted for these desired outcomes.     

MENTORED EMPLOYEE REQUIREMENTS: 
o	Employees must be assigned to AFPC/DPC
o	Employees may volunteer to participate
o	Employees will get out of the program what effort is put forth
o	Effort will include on and off duty time by the employee – this is defined as extra-curricular/self-development efforts as well as efforts to improve one’s self in his/her functional area 
·	On duty: Continual efforts demonstrated to learn functional area.  Effort put forth for mentorship program will be high initially and then taper off as one grows in the relationship
·	Off duty:  amount of effort demonstrated will be up to the employee 
·	Feedback sessions will assess if enough time is being spent by employee in required areas (input provided by Mentor to mentored employee)

MENTOR REQUIREMENTS: 
o	Mentors will be selected by AFPC/DPC
§	Will not be on a volunteer basis, although volunteers will be requested
§	Will allow for mentored employee to request mentor outside of AFPC/DPC chain of command (i.e., other personnel in DPK, Re-engineering Office, across AF/DoD, etc.)
o	Mentors will be assigned to an employee or a group of employees.  
§	Mentoring in a one-on-one environment is best; more quality time is spent with the mentored employee.  However, there may be instances in which two or three mentored employees may be assigned to a mentor due to the number of participants and the few mentors available.  If one-on-one mentoring cannot be accomplished due to the sheer number of participants, grouping similar employees by career tracks and by functional areas may be needed  (i.e., PAQs, Students, all GS-13s, GS-12s on AF Track Program, etc.)
§	Mentors will be paired with mentored employees based upon functional area (if possible), mentored employee’s  background, goals, and grade level.  Additional considerations may include:    
·	Students paired with a journeyman specialist
·	PAQs paired with a Branch Chief/Region Chief/Division Chief
·	GS-12/13s paired with a Region/Division Chief
o	Mentors may not be the mentored employee’s immediate supervisor
o	Accountability will be monitored via Mentored Employee Feedback 

MENTORSHIP PROGRAM EXPECTATIONS: 
o	Meet DPC Objectives (stated above)
o	Length of the Mentorship Program: for life! Idea is to have a mentor and keep that person indefinitely.  If not for life, then certainly for the duration the mentored employee remains at AFPC.
o	Length of time spent with assigned mentor: Up to each Mentor to determine length of time spent when both parties meet.
o	DPC assessment of Mentorship Program: it is important to measure our investment (time and resources); therefore, this will be accomplished through the DPC Mentorship Program Feedback form completed by the mentored employee and the mentor.  Form will be submitted to DPC Mentorship Program Coordinator to DPC.  “Periodic” is defined as quarterly. 
o	DPC Mentorship Program does not interfere with Air Force DPC Mentorship Program (both programs are different; DPC employees can elect to be in one or the other, or both)   

TRAINING OF MENTORS ON THE FOLLOWING: 
§	What is Mentorship?? 
§	Expectations of being a DPC Mentor (there is a difference between being a supervisor/manager and being a mentor to an employee; these difference will be spelled out in the training provided to all selected mentors)

Data qualifier means a specified character (or string of characters) that immediately precedes a data field that defines the general category or intended use of the data that follows.
DoD recognized unique identification equivalent means a unique identification method that is in commercial use and has been recognized by DoD. All DoD recognized unique identification equivalents are listed at http://www.acq.osd.mil/uid.
DoD unique item identification means marking an item with a unique item identifier that has machine-readable data elements to distinguish it from all other like and unlike items. In addition—
(1) For items that are serialized within the enterprise identifier, the unique identifier shall include the data elements of issuing agency code, enterprise identifier, and a unique serial number.
(2) For items that are serialized within the part number within the enterprise identifier, the unique identifier shall include the data elements of issuing agency code, enterprise identifier, the original part number, and the serial number.
Enterprise means the entity (i.e., a manufacturer or vendor) responsible for assigning unique item identifiers to items.
Enterprise identifier means a code that is uniquely assigned to an enterprise by a registration (or controlling) authority.
Government's unit acquisition cost means--
