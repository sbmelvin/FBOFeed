<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Portland, OR intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Board. The Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Board (UCSRB) proposes contracting to NMFS and other funding
entities for funding through 2009 of the stewardship of the Upper Columbia region?s fish and aquatic resource
data using existing data management tools that were specifically created for use with the Upper Columbia
Monitoring Strategy. The role of the Data Steward would be to assist all agencies that manage monitoring
data related to fish and aquatic resources in the Upper Columbia region and to do so in a coordinated fashion.
Background Information on the UCSRB Data Management Position
The Data Steward position is founded on several successful data management developments in the Upper
Columbia in recent years. For example, the need for a coordinated data management system was specifically
identified as a key objective in the Upper Columbia Regional Technical Team?s (RTT) draft Strategic
Plan. BPA and NMFS have developed the STEM Databank and other data management tools for the Wenatchee
and Entiat River basin under the Integrated Status and Effectiveness Monitoring Program (ISEMP). Additional
data management tools have been developed in the Okanogan River Basin to archive data collected as part of
the Okanogan Basin Monitoring and Evaluation Program (OBMEP). Data are also being collected in the
Methow River Basin by the state, federal, tribal and private entities.
All of these long-term status and trend monitoring efforts need to be coordinated and managed to serve
local and regional needs under programmatic initiatives such as the Federal Columbia River Power System Biological
Opinion mandates, Endangered Species Act recovery implementation, PUD hatchery program monitoring
requirements, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council?s fish and wildlife program, and State and
Tribal salmon recovery and management efforts. The Data Steward would provide technical expertise to the
data collectors working in the Upper Columbia and would create or utilize data management tools to organize,
upload, store, analyze, and report monitoring data for the Upper Columbia ESU/DPS.
Programmatic fisheries and aquatic resource management programs, such as those identified above, require
a burgeoning amount of data in order to answer increasingly complicated and inter-dependent questions
that help to inform a larger and more diverse set of interests. Current ways of storing and processing fisheries
and habitat data is uncoordinated. Individual agency computers do not effectively meet the novel, evolving,
and collective needs of these agencies and the public in recovery planning, effectiveness monitoring, and decision
making. By not coordinating data management needs, there is a risk of duplication of effort and wasting of
resources. Also, many agencies need data to be more accessible through a coordinated, centralized, web-based
data management system. Consequently, the development of a regionally coordinated data management system
is a necessary step to effective monitoring and evaluation.
Perhaps the most immediate need for hiring a Data Steward is that ISEMP?s current role as the defacto
Data Steward in the Wenatchee and Entiat rivers cannot continue as that program shifts focus to develop its
work in other subbasins. While ISEMP will continue to conduct monitoring in the Upper Columbia, develop
new data management tools, host the STEM Databank, and maintain the established data management standards,
this program does not have the capacity to serve the other programmatic needs identified in this proposal.
TASKS/SERVICES

The contractor shall:
1) Implement the Upper Columbia data stewardship strategy by providing technical guidance and assistance to
cooperating data generators in the Upper Columbia.
2) Provide first-tier customer support to monitoring and evaluation projects that are aligned with the Upper
Columbia Monitoring Strategy (Hillman 2006) and the Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Research, Monitoring
and Evaluation Plan.
3) Develop protocols to facilitate data collected in each subbasin to be integrated into the STEM Databank and
the coordination of data uploading to the STEM Databank.
4) Document protocols, standardize datasets, program additional functionality, document analysis procedures,
support the production of reports or maps, coordinate standardized methodologies, and teach workshops and
training sessions for cooperating data generators, the UCSRB, the RTT, and the public.
DELIVERABLES
1) The development of an agency-neutral, locally-operated, standardized and coordinated data management
system for Upper Columbia fish, habitat, and water quality data.
2) The development of a locally-based staff to support the operation of a data management system that collects
data from local data generators.
3) The compilation of local data in order to conduct ESU/DPS wide analysis, and coordinate the flow of data
into regional databases.
4) The reporting of data on a regular, timely, basis for adaptive management decision making.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Spark Holland Symbiosis Triathlon
<DESC>000HCTBD-2007-44815 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to Spark Holland Inc. (DBA: Symbiosis Components) 666 Plainsboro, NJ 08536-3030.  A purchase order will be issued for 1(one) each Triathlon Autosampler, Manufacturer Product Number: SP905.001. The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR 6.302-1. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to continued need to match existing products for on-going research being conducted by the CDC, National Center for Environmental Health; and the existence of limited rights in data, patent rights and copyrights which make this equipment available from only one source.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide the laboratory equipment are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 10 days of the publication date of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquires may be sent to Russell T. Oxford by e-mail at efn3@CDC.gov or by fax to 770-488-2670.
