<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a sole source contract to TomTec Corporation, 525 W. Monroe St., Ste 2360, Chicago, IL 60661 for the acquisition of two TomTec Formatter systems. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 423990, Other Miscellaneous Durable Goods Merchant Wholesalers. The period of performance for this procurement is 6 months.
<p><br />Tomtec is the sole source manufacturer of the Tomtec Formatter workstation. Tomtec Formatter has the following unique features which are critical for the success in automating the reformatting of incoming samples in screw top cryovials to the 96 well plate format for sample processing. The Tomtec Formatter Workstation comes with capabilities to uncap and recap cryovials, automatic calibration of the pipette tips with 4-place SATORIUS balance, non-contact dispensing to avoid cross contamination, liquid level detection, and Peltier cooled racks. These combined functions make Tomtec the only vendor for our needs.</p>
<p>This acquisition will provide the laboratory with instruments that can increase sampler preparation throughput thus extending the productivity of the laboratory. The Tomtec Formatter Workstation has features mentioned in section 5b that are critical for this project. These features make Tomtec the most appropriate vendor for our needs.</p>
<p>In addition to Tomtec, there are several other manufacturers that offer robotic liquid handling system. However, the Tomtec Formatter Workstation has some unique features which make their instruments much more compatible to our needs. The Tomtec Formatter Workstation comes with capabilities to uncap and recap cryovials, automatic calibration of the pipette tips with 4-place SATORIUS balance, non-contact dispensing to avoid cross contamination, liquid level detection, and Peltier cooled racks. These combined functions make Tomtec the most appropriate vendor for our needs. None of the other vendors can perform all of the capabilities detailed above which are required functions for our laboratory performance.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to TomTec Corporation. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-Q-14388 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN July 31, 2012.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) #LCFDL12R5000 for Data Analytics Software Tools and Services for the LC/FEDLINK Program. The objective of the solicitation is to establish multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts for acquisition of or access to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) data analytics software applications and tools and analysis services for the FEDLINK program. FEDLINK is a nationwide interagency consortia sponsored by the Library of Congress. These will be multi-agency contracts (MACs) established in accordance with the Library of Congress (LC) Fiscal Operations Improvement Act, P.L. 106-481, Section 103 (2 U.S.C. &sect; 182c.) Any federal entity including the executive branch, the legislative branch, the judicial branch, and independent agencies as well as contractors to government agencies who are authorized to use federal sources of supply may be authorized to place orders under these contracts in accordance with the terms and procedures described in the solicitation.
<p>Contractors shall offer commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) data analytics software, applications and tools that analyze large complex structured and/or unstructured data from different data sources. These analysis tools shall have the ability to aggregate, store, mine, analyze and visualize large amounts of data to support the organization's decision making. Contractors shall provide tools that analyze raw data with the objective of drawing conclusions, identifying trends, or obtaining insight that otherwise would remain unknown. Products offered shall follow industry standards and should be scalable, flexible, and customizable. Data analytics software, applications and tools of interest are tools that can be used in all or part of the data analytics process including data mining, manipulation, modeling, querying, reports, visualization, statistical analysis, forecasting, text mining, text analytics, and predictive analytics.</p>
<p>Contractors shall be capable of providing products/services for ordering agencies with multiple organizational levels and geographic locations nationwide and/or worldwide. The Contractor shall also be capable of handling multiple purchase orders simultaneously. Contracts may be divided into three lots. Contractors must offer products/services under either Lot 1 and/or Lot 2 in order to provide products/services under Lot 3. The three lots to be offered are:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LOT 1 - SELF-SERVICE DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS.</span> Products under Lot 1 shall provide data analytics software, applications and tools for end-users (executives, managers, scientist, analyst and front-line workers). These self-service tools shall be intuitive, interactive and deliver reporting and analysis functionality. The tools shall have on-demand capabilities that allow users to: 1.) Access, explore and interact with the organization's data from diverse sources 2.) Perform ad hoc queries and reporting and 3.) Conduct complex analysis. This category of tools encompasses data exploration with visualization, dashboards, and includes data mining features to uncover hidden patterns and relationships. These data analytics tools shall have the ability to output data in popular formats and integrate with other commonly used applications. The tools shall allow users to monitor, analyze, and drill to details.</p>
<p>Contractors may offer integrated product suites that include query tools, dashboards and reporting software. Interactive and dynamic data visualization, authoring, shared collaboration, and data analysis are key capabilities desired by this group of end-users. Visual discovery tools make it easy for users to see trends, patterns, and outliers in data. Data analytics software, applications and tools under Lot 1 shall enable users to conduct exploration and discovery on their own, without relying on experts or IT personnel. These tools shall require no programming or specialized training.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LOT 2 - DEVELOPERS SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND TOOLS</span>. Contractor shall provide data analytics tools for developers, IT personnel, and power users. These users are the organization's staff that has the skills to build custom applications, enterprise portals, mashups, and analytical models for themselves, other staff members, and the organization. These products are the data analytics software, applications and tools that IT personnel need to easily and efficiently develop, deploy and manage large amounts of data. The data analytics tools provided shall offer functions to the technical staff that would assist them in data preparation, data integration and federation, metadata management, user control and role-based access, security, score processing, creation of templates, and build and deploy models and dashboard, etc.</p>
<p>Contractors may offer in-memory applications, workgroup tools and sandboxes. These users conduct statistical analysis, data mining, and advanced analytics. However, their primary tasks are to gather, cleanse and integrate the data, delivering a comprehensive and consistent set of data for analytic use and properly incorporate models into business processes. The analytics tools would require the user to process programming skills or specialized computer training.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LOT 3 - CUSTOM ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS</span>. Lot 3 is only open to contractors who qualify under Lot 1 and/or Lot 2. Under Lot 3, Contractors may provide organization specific solutions or a complete customized enterprise-wide solution to individual organizations. The contractors may work with customers to provide seamless integration of structured and/or unstructured internal and external data into the customers' workflow environment. Contractors may offer Data Management, Performance Management, Business Intelligence, High Performance Analytical Platforms, Software as a Service (SaaS), Cloud Computing, Enterprise Application Integration solutions, World Wide Web and Mobile Platforms, etc.</p>
<p>Contractors shall offer secure, reliable, and scalable integrated software solutions. The goal is to deliver accurate and consistent data in a single version of truth. Contractors may provide tailored products and services associated with the data analytics software, applications and tools they offer under Lot 1 and/or Lot 2. The contractors shall address how their customer specific products will be updated and maintained. Customer-specific offerings may be described and negotiated by the contracting office on an individual basis.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL LOTS. The contractor shall make technical support services readily available to customers across multiple time zones. The contractor shall provide customers with multiple options when accessing technical support (e-mail, web, fax, 800 phone number, etc.). The contractor shall provide data analytics and related training and consultation services appropriate for each lot.</p>
<p>Education and Training. The contractor may offer data analytics and related training to organizations in support of the contractor's product being provided and in support of the organization's personnel training needs.</p>
<p>Consulting Services. The contractor may provide advice, direction, and assessment in understanding and identifying the organization's unique data analytics requirements and needs. Consultants may be used to recommend methodology or determine the best analytical solution complementary to existing enterprise architecture and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

A Firm-Fixed-Price contract will be awarded for a Base Period and two (2) Option Periods (if exercised) and will be from approximately November 2012 to April 2014. The Government will award the contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be the Best Value to the Government. The award may be made to a superior offeror which is not the lowest offered price, but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of a higher price. Proposals will be reviewed for completeness and evaluated for acceptability against the following evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance: 1) Experience and Qualifications of Contractor Key Personnel [and Subcontractors, if applicable]; 2) Past Performance and 3) Price Reasonableness. Factors 1 and 2 are of equal weighting and are significantly more important than price; however price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. Award of the contract will be made as a whole to the offeror whose proposal conforms to all requirements of the specifications and is the "greatest value" to the Government, cost and other factors considered. The Government may elect to conduct discussions with offerors whose proposals are technically acceptable (or which may be expected to be made acceptable by moderate modification) and fall within the competitive price range. The Government reserves the right, however, to award a contract based on initial offers without conducting discussions. Therefore, each proposal should be submitted from the offeror's most favorable technical and price standpoints.</p>

For the aforementioned reasons, Carl Zeiss is the only known source for this procurement.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.

item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx". Interested parties may obtain copies of Military and Federal Specifications and Standards, Qualified Product Lists, Military Handbooks, and other standardization documents from the DoD Single Stock Point (DODSSP), in Philadelphia, PA.

<CONTACT>Deborah K. Crisp, Phone 6182206731, Email deborah.crisp@ustranscom.mil
<DESC>TRDM is the USTRANSCOM tool used to manage enterprise reference data. The tool is owned by the Government and maintained and modernized, as necessary, by the Contractor. TRDM includes data from the former Table Management Distribution System (TMDS), which managed Air Mobility Command (AMC) reference data. The majority of this data has since transitioned to TRDM and remaining tables and interfaces associated with TMDS are being migrated to TRDM. The reference data management process is consistent with the Information Reference Model (IRM) manual as published by USTRANSCOM/J6. The TRDM Program Management Office (PMO) is responsible for providing and interpreting USTRANSCOM policy as it applies to TRDM.
<p>This contract will combine the maintenance of the reference tables, design and implementation of new capabilities, to include the expansion of the Real Property Unique Identifier Registry (RPUIR) capability to become the information management system, dubbed the Data Analytics and Integration Support (DAIS) platform, supporting OSD (I&amp;E) Business Enterprise Integration office Real Property Inventory Reporting (RPIR) and Enterprise Energy Information Management (EEIM) requirements.</p>
<p>In FY2003, the Installations &amp; Environment (I&amp;E) Domain partnered with the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and other Business Management Modernization Program (BMMP) Business Mission Areas (BMAs) to transform or reengineer business processes for the accountability of real property. The goal was, and still is, the availability of reliable, timely, and useful real property asset information to support functional analysis and decision making as well as financial reporting. Inter-Agency and Cross-Service work groups were established to identify the data elements and to analyze and resolve process issues. The results were approved in January 2005 as the RPIR document. The long term goal is to expand the current functions of the RPUIR by incorporating the full Real Property Information Model (RPIM). Real Property Unique Identifiers (RPUIDs) will continue to be implemented for the nearly 1 million global site and real property assets and the DAIS system will continue to act as the centralized data source for RPUIDs both for initial assignment of new RPUIDs and for lookup of existing RPUIDs.</p>
<p>The DUSD (I&amp;E) convened a working group to standardize energy information and business processes utilizing existing enterprise information to the extent possible. The standard data elements that the working group developed became the EEIM model. As incorporated within the DAIS System, EEIM will provide net-centric energy data access services and an energy data warehouse that will provide a consolidated view of timely, reliable energy information for use in measuring, managing and reporting DoD energy consumption, conservation, and renewable energy production information. DoD's facility energy vision is to use integrated processes and a standard data structure to collect facility energy consumption, renewable energy generation, and energy efficiency project data. This integrated information structure will facilitate trend analysis, performance comparison, and efficiency improvement across facilities and DoD Components.<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide continuing on-site support services contributing directly to the management of reference data for USTRANSCOM, its Transportation Component Commands: AMC, Military Sealift Command (MSC), Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), and other Department of Defense (DoD) communities. DoD is subject to extensive energy reporting requirements that impose a growing burden on DoD personnel to collect, analyze, package, and transmit energy data. DoD currently does not have standardized enterprise facility energy information, nor does it have enterprise-wide information technology systems to support facility energy management. This lack of standardization requires energy managers and other personnel to manually collect, transform, and reformat data to meet separate data calls. This highly inefficient atmosphere leaves energy managers with little time to manage facility energy consumption, or to focus on ways to improve facility energy efficiency.</p>

<DESC>The DMO is announcing an Industry day to be held on 22 October 2012, and a White Paper that will be due on 5 November 2012. Please see attachments for more information.
<p>The DMO is requesting industries comment on its ability to provide support in the development of DIB v4.2, and working as part of an integrated team consisting of the DMO and other designated contractors and Government agencies. The organizations will work as part of an integrated team to design, develop, test, package, and release DIB v4.2 functionality using agile software development methodologies to build capabilities in short development cycles lasting between two and four weeks.</p>
<p>DIB v4.2 will build upon the DCGS Data Framework (DDF) infrastructure introduced in DIB v4.0. Built on an Open Services Gateway initiative (OSGi) framework, the Distributed Data Framework (DDF) allows independent modular features to be developed and deployed. This modular strategy helps put enhanced capabilities into the Warfighter's hands without delays and is the basis for ongoing DIB v4.2 development efforts consisting of many separately released DIB components.</p>

<DESC>This sources sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. This announcement is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify sources with the requisite qualifications that could provide the products/services stated herein. All businesses, large and small businesses (8(a), SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB) capable of performing the requirement indicated below are encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is seeking vendors who are a capable of manufacturing Neutron Guides. NCNR is a large laboratory facility consisting of a suite of instruments that measure the interaction of radiation with various materials to study their structure and properties. The NCNR maintains a wide variety of instruments that allow great flexibility in the type of samples and phenomena that can be studied and measured.</p>
<p>The majority of these instruments use neutrons with energies at the low end of the energy spectrum called cold neutrons. These cold neutrons must be delivered from the neutron source to the instruments and neutron guides are used for this purpose. In much the same manner as a fiber optic cable carries light rays, the neutron guides channel the neutrons away from the source and carry them to a location where they are used to probe matter in one of the many neutron-scattering spectrometers at the NCNR. The interior of the guides is coated with a neutron-reflective material to maximize the transmission of neutrons by allowing those making contact with the interior surfaces at incident angles below a characteristic angle to be reflected and continue downstream toward the desired destination. The characteristic angle and reflection efficiency are functions of the reflective surface and coating properties and the energy of the incident neutron. In order to remain a state-of-the-art neutron scattering facility, the NCNR continues to evolve by adding new instrumentation and upgrading existing instrumentation.</p>
<p>Sources that have the ability to provide this instrument are asked to respond to this notice with a corporate capability statement of a maximum of ten (10) pages to provide a clear and complete narrative of current capabilities to meet the requirements as detailed above. Those sources are requested to respond to this notice and in so doing, provide the following information: organization information to include company name and address, size of business as it relates to NAICS code 334516 (Small Business size standard of 500 employees), current point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), list of current GSA federal supply schedules (if applicable) under which your company can provide the products described in this notice, and a list of contracts within the past three (3) years in which a similar instrument was provided. All responses shall be emailed to Lynda.Roark@nist.gov so that they are received no later than 5:00 pm EST October 30, 2012.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. The National Weather Service (NWS) is conducting market research for the replacement of four (4) Transmitter Control and Monitoring circuit cards and associated backplane in its 175 NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radars (WSR-88D). The NWS plans on developing and acquiring a new transmitter control and monitoring system. The current four card design is based on mid 1980's TTL technology. The current circuit cards and backplane are becoming obsolete. The NWS desires to develop a single circuit card and backplane using modern technology that can be installed in the current transmitter. The new card will be modular and will plug into the new backplane. The NWS requires the services of a reengineering and specification development organization. The organization must be capable of analyzing complex electronic function and designing circuits and systems capable of controlling a transmitter. The organization must be capable of prototype development, testing and fine tuning of a final design. Upon completion of a successful prototype, the organization must be capable of producing an acquisition specification. The specification would include all necessary drawings, bill-of-materials, design and manufacturing specifications and automated manufacturing data such as Gerber files that would support the government's procurement, of sufficient quantities of circuit cards and backplanes to support the radar fleet. Any procurement of productions quantities of this design would be done using a different contract vehicle. The government requires unlimited rights to the resulting design.
<p>A brief description of the logic and functionality of the existing cards is as follows: The Control and Monitoring circuit cards consist of the Control Adaptor, Control Logic, Control Interface, and Remote Monitoring Subsystem (RMS) Interface. Operation of the transmitter is controlled by the control and monitoring circuit cards. These circuits provide front panel metering for voltages and currents, fault monitoring status indications, transmitter status, and external interfacing with the main data processor. Timing triggers and remote control commands received by the main data processor are distributed in the transmitter by the control and monitoring circuit cards and associated backplane.</p>
<p>A brief description of the backplane is as follows: The Backplane is based on wire-wrap technology mounted to an aluminum support structure, approximately 18 x 14 inches in size. The 27 50-pin connectors used are obsolete and need to be upgraded to more common style connectors. The majority of signals are TTL with a few low current voltage lines. Additional information regarding the current design can be found at: ftp.roc.noaa.gov - /pub/Transmitter_CC_Backplane/</p>
<p>RESPONSES: Responses to this RFI must contain sufficient information to clearly demonstrate that the responding organization has sufficient experience and capability to modernize the current design as described, and document that design sufficiently to support manufacture. The information must include the history, level of complexity and customer points of contact for past similar contracts. The information must include a description of the responding organization's facility and personnel resources available with specific attention given to design analysis, circuit card design, and prototyping capabilities. This RFI does not constitute an invitation for bids, request for proposal, or request for quote and there is no related solicitation posted. Accordingly, respondents will not be reimbursed for any expenses incurred in providing a response. Any questions regarding this RFI should be addressed in writing to the NWS Project Engineer, Mr. Glenn Secrest (<a href="mailto:glenn.s.secrest@noaa.gov">glenn.s.secrest@noaa.gov</a>) with a courtesy copy provided to Contracting Officer, Chad Hepp at <a href="mailto:Chad.M.Hepp@noaa.gov">Chad.M.Hepp@noaa.gov</a>.

<CONTACT>Valerie M. Whipple, Phone 301-492-3628, Email valerie.whipple@nrc.gov
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposals. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of commercial and public entities available to provide the NRC with the services described below and to assess their capabilities. The purpose of this request for information is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of conflict of interest (COI). For information on NRC COI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5 (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including small business/small disadvantaged businesses and other Federal entities, are invited to submit a response to the market research questions below. Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures, CDs, or videos is discouraged. Responses are due no later than 5:00 p.m. EST, Thursday, October 25, 2012. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. Please send your responses via email to Valerie.Whipple@nrc.gov.
<p>The NRC collects, reviews, analyzes, and maintains data for events involving nuclear material (e.g., non-reactor events such as medical, academic, and industrial events). The NRC also maintains a database (the Nuclear Material Events Database (NMED)) used to capture the information regarding these nuclear material events. Telephonic and written licensee reports of nuclear material events are submitted to NRC under applicable reporting requirements. The event data may also be obtained from inspection reports, investigation reports, and enforcement action documents. In addition to data on nuclear material events for NRC licensees, the data on nuclear material events dating back to 1991 that have occurred in Agreement States, and lost non-Atomic Energy Act (AEA) radioactive material dating back to October 1998, have also been formally included in NMED. The NRC receives approximately 500 to 1,000 new materials events reports and approximately 2,000 to 2,500 event record updates per year from NRC licensees, non-licensees, and Agreement States.</p>
<p>The NRC seeks contractor support to provide technical assistance to the NRC staff in meeting NRC obligations for event collection, review, and analysis for nuclear material and fuel cycle events, and maintenance of NMED. Specifically, some of the primary contract support we are seeking includes 1) collecting, reviewing, and analyzing nuclear material events; 2) providing event review assessment against existing NRC/Agreement State requirements to support NRC's nuclear materials assessment staff; 3) providing technical assistance on specific problems related to nuclear material events; 4) maintaining and upgrading NMED (database. software, and website) and the NMED Agreement State software (local standalone system provided to the State); and 5) developing new procedures and/or modifying existing procedures regarding the use/maintenance of NMED.</p>
<p>NMED consists of a relational database with a password-secure website to store and manage information regarding nuclear material related events. The NMED event data is maintained on a PC in a Microsoft Access database, which is transferred to a Microsoft SQL database that is queried from the website. The website is a Microsoft.Net application (Web Forms, apx) that runs on a Windows Server 2008 server running Microsoft Internet Information Server. The contractor shall comply with all Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) guidance for Level 2 authentication. The facility shall provide general hosting and operational support for a system requiring high integrity, and high availability. All hardware and software shall comply with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2.</p>

<DESC>TITLE<br />The Advanced Pilot Training (T-X) Branch (WLZA), Training Aircraft Division, Mobility Directorate, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, is issuing a pre-decisional/market research related Request for Information (RFI). This presents an opportunity for industry to provide input to support affordability analyses.<br />FOR PLANNING PURPOSES
<p>This posting is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or a commitment by the Government to award a contract now or in the future. There have been no decisions made by the Government on this acquisition nor is there a commitment to do so. This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only. Submitting a response to this request for information is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated. Responses will be treated as market research information only and will not be evaluated as a proposal. Any question or comment requiring a response will be posted on a subsequent FBO with the Government's response. This RFI will help the United States Government (USG) identify possible agenda topics for future Industry Days and will enable the market research process. Dates for future Industry Days are TBD.<br />REQUIREMENT<br />The Advanced Pilot Training (APT) Family of Systems (FoS) will utilize a full range of ground (e.g., simulators, computer based training, etc.) training systems as well as flight training systems as part of a fully integrated family of systems. If the Government proceeds with the procurement of the APT T-X FoS, it is considering awarding two basic contracts to a single awardee. The first contract would be to complete the EMD phase. This procurement will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, as supplemented. A single award would be used for completion of the Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase, the Production and Deployment phase, and the Operations and Support phases of the program. The EMD contract would be predominately Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF). A portion of the contract will be a combination of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) for Full Rate Production, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) for any studies/analyses and Time &amp; Material (T&amp;M) in order to cover other in-scope modifications. The second contract would be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the remaining phases of the acquisition. The IDIQ would include FPIF delivery orders for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), Firm Fixed Price (FFP) for Full Rate Production (FRP) delivery orders and CPFF, FFP and T&amp;M for Interim Contractor Support (ICS), studies, analysis and "what if" exercises for possible in-scope efforts. <br />GENERAL INFORMATION<br />1. Potential respondents shall understand all laws and regulations required in doing business with the United States Government for an ACAT ID program as defined by Department of Defense Directive (DoD) Instruction 5000.02, "Operation of the Defense Acquisition System" dated December 8, 2008. Noteworthy are compliance with Cost Accounting Standards, Earned Value Management System, Certified Cost and Pricing Data, Item Unique Identification, Airworthiness Certifications, etc. FAR Parts 2, 15 and 16 should be consulted and used.<br />2. The attached matrix is a list of pre-decisional requirements associated with the T-X program. These requirements are currently in draft and will not be finalized until the release of the final request for proposal. As the USG is conducting market research on these potential requirements, we ask you provide input to tell us what issues these present to you as Industry. Your input will aid in affordability analyses and decisions on final requirements.<br />3. Any comments or questions on the above information should be sent to the Training Aircraft Division Contracting Point of Contact, Lt Col Myron Stamps, at AFLCMC/WLZA, Bldg 11A, 1970 Monahan Way, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7211 or email Myron.Stamps@us.af.mil no later than 30 calendar days from this posting. Respondents are reminded that participation in this market research is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated for any portion of this market research. Respondents are also reminded that questions or comments requiring a response will have both the question/comment and Government response posted on FBO.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning/information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This is not a solicitation. This notice does not constitute a Request for Bid, Request for Quote or Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.
<p>1. PURPOSE. The US Forest Services, Washington Office (WO) Acquisition Management (AQM), Information Technology (IT) Support Branch is conducting a market analysis with this RFI to refine the requirement and determine the most suitable approach for acquiring and fulfilling the needs associated with providing the full range of information technology help desk support services listed in paragraph 3 below, entitled Overview of Capabilities.</p>
<p>The information collected in this RFI will be used to further define the government's requirements and create the appropriate acquisition strategy. Consequently, do not submit proprietary information in response to this request. All submission information will be considered in finalizing the US Forest Service IT Help Desk Services requirements.</p>
<p>2. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND. The United States Forest Service (FS) is issuing this RFI to obtain information on the latest offerings, best practices, and approaches for information technology help desk services. This RFI shall not be construed as a decision or obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services cited in this notice. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The FS Chief Information Office (CIO) uses a centralized help desk to provide 24x7x365 Tier 0 (self-help) and Tier 1 (help desk) support services to over 30,000 IT users across FS working both in offices and remotely. Support covers the gamut of IT systems and products, including computers, servers, telecommunications, radios, and commercial and government developed applications and software.</p>
<p>In addition to FS CIO requirements, as part of the share-first federal strategy, the centralized help desk will also provide support to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Information Technology Services (ITS) and USDA's eAuthentication program. ITS supports approximately 65,000 users and eAuthentiation supports approximately 575,000 users.</p>
<p>Incident volume varies for the combined portfolio of support, but averages approximately 30,000 per month. Additionally, FS envisions an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract/Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to which other help desks from USDA, FS and other USDA agencies may transition. The contract vehicle will support multiple customers and may require use of multiple systems or transition of data from multiple systems. It is the FS's intent to benefit from total contract volume pricing, invoiced by Task Order.</p>
<p>3. OVERVIEW OF CAPABILITIES. FS is seeking a total solution operated at the contractor's facilities. Services to be provided include:<br />&bull; 90-day Contract Transition efforts facilitating full cutover of all Forest Service/USDA customers from the incumbent to the new contractor.<br />&bull; Transferring help desk data from the current database/system.<br />&bull; Providing a toll-free number for help desk calls, as well as an interactive web-based platform.<br />&bull; Answering and resolving customer calls through the contractor's toll-free phone number.<br />&bull; Responding to customer tickets received through a variety of channels (web, chat, email, fax, etc).<br />&bull; Providing warm hand-offs to Tier 2 FS/USDA staff. <br />&bull; Managing and contributing to a repository of Knowledge Management documents.<br />&bull; Logging tickets into the contractor's ticket management system. <br />&bull; Providing user-friendly tools to manage and provide meaningful reports on IT assistance requests. <br />&bull; Assisting customers in the completion of service request forms and templates.<br />&bull; Performing hardware and software configuration diagnostic procedures.<br />&bull; Coordinating more complex requests with FS employees who serve in Tier 2 and Tier 3 capacities.</p>
<p>4. SUMMARY OF REQUESTED INFORMATION. FS is not seeking elaborate replies, but rather concise, meaningful responses from vendors with help desk expertise. In 15 single-sided 8.5" x 11" pages or less (title page or table of contents do not count against the page count), vendors are requested to provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Company Information<br />a. Name, address and DUNS<br />b. Current contract vehicles (such as GSA Schedules, GWACs, etc) with help desk services within scope<br />c. Number of contracts for 1) government and 2) commercial help desk/call center services of similar scope, size and complexity in the last three years<br />d. Indicate whether they are/are not a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), hub-zone certified, woman-owned, or Historically Black College or University Minority Institution.<br />2. Describe the capabilities, features and benefits of your help desk support solution, paying special attention to new capabilities/features that go beyond a "standard" help desk solution. <br />3. Describe your help desk platform and its capabilities in knowledge management, web interfaces, data collection, reporting (user-friendly real-time, canned, ad hoc, etc) and other features. <br />4. How much of the platform is already developed vs what will require customization?<br />5. Currently, "RightNow" and "Remedy" platforms are used. FS/USDA owns the data. How would you transition the data for reuse in your tool? <br />6. Because of the nature of FS work, please describe features of the help desk solution that address mobility issues.<br />7. What pricing approaches have been used in your help desk contracts? Please also comment on the advantages/disadvantages of those approaches. NOTE: It is the FS's intent to benefit from total contract volume pricing, invoiced by Task Order.<br />8. What performance standards are used in current help desk contracts held by your company? <br />9. What incentives, if any, are used in your current help desk contracts and comment on the successfulness of those incentives.<br />10. Provide three references for help desk contracts within the past three years. References should include:<br />a. Customer<br />b. Name, phone number and email address for the customer's program manager<br />c. Contract Name<br />d. Contract Number<br />e. Contract Value<br />f. Contract type (if a hybrid contract, identify specific tasks that were fixed price versus labor hour)<br />g. Brief description of services, including information such as number of FTE and annual number of calls<br />h. If a transition period existed, note the length of the transition period, the sufficiency of the transition period and any recommended transition best practices from previous experiences.<br />11. Any additional information that may be helpful to the FS for a help desk Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>5. SUBMISSION INFORMATION. All responses shall be organized according to and address each item of paragraph 4 above, and shall be provided electronically in Word or PDF to Ms. Liza Herrera at lsherrera@fs.fed.us. All responses must be submitted via email by 5:00pm ET on November 1, 2012.</p>

<DESC>Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division, Material Science Code MS00 Defense Utility Energy Reporting System (DUERS) Project requires a complete set of 2013 ASTM standards  print version.  As much as possible we want to tie procedures for the DUERS instruction and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to commercially available standards and where possible, to use commercially available standards in all assessments, tests, measurements, and/or verifications performed.  The use of commercially available standards leads to knowledge transfer and a reduction of future program risks in applying the products of our DUERS project on a large scale.  Additionally, it is law that the U.S. Government integrate commercial standards where possible as part of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act.
 Having access to an entire suite of useful standards in a timely fashion will lead to a more transparent and applicable DUERS instruction and SOP, will help in assessing CNIC energy efficiency measurement and validation issues, and will help give us a head start in updating or writing CIRCUITS instructions and SOPs.
The government intends to award a sole-source, firm fixed priced contract to American Society for Testing Materials DBA ASTM International.  
This procurement is commercial item IAW FAR Part 12. No solicitation will be issued but responsible sources may submit inquiries or request for information to tan.mai@navy.mil or by phone at 951-273-4963
THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302-1 FOR THIS PROCURMENT ACTION.
 INTERESTED PARTIES MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT, OR SUBMIT CAPABILITY STATEMENTS. THIS NOTICE OF INTEREST IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES OR PROPOSALS.

<DESC>Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific) intends to increase the contract ceiling by $12.5M on contract number N66001-09-D-0032, awarded to EDO Professional Services Inc., at 2560 Huntington Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22303-1404 , citing the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Contract N66001-09-D-0032 provides services related to marine mammals, unmanned vehicle systems, and associated equipment that are used for Fleet mine countermeasures (MCM), force protection (FP) missions, and research/development projects.  These services include engineering, logistics, configuration management, program management, research, depot maintenance, system administration, and tactical/strategic planning. EDO Professional Services, Inc. is the only firm that possesses the unique and detailed knowledge of the Underwater Mine Countermeasures (UMCM) system architecture and performance requirements.  This action is due to increase in operational tempo and this expertise is critical in ensuring the continuity of uninterrupted support of operations, evaluation, maintenance, training, and sustainment of Fleet UMCM systems in meeting the emergent Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) requirements for prototype deployment.  If these services are not continued, the Commander Fifth Fleet (C5F) initiative will not be executed as directed by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), which would have a significant adverse impact on the directed operational deployment capability.  EDO Professional Services, Inc. is the only firm capable of providing the required support services without an unacceptable delay in deployment.  The anticipated period of performance will be extended by approximately 60 to 90 days.  The current contract will expire on 16 January 2013.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541330. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interest and capability statements received within 15 days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  Questions concerning this modification may be directed to Trapper J. Ballard, SSC Pacific Contract Specialist, at trapper.ballard@navy.mil or (619) 553-7502.  No modification will be posted.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to contract using other than full and open competition for the following existing contract requirement:
<p>The Transportation Security Operations Center (TSOC) continues to have a valid operational requirement for five and half (5.5) Watch Officer contractors. The contractor Watch Officers perform a critical role in manning the Transportation Contact Center (TCC). TSA created the Transportation Call Center (TCC) to satisfy the requirements based on the 9/11 Act which calls for the creation of a mechanism by which members of the public may report certain security-related concerns to TSA. The TSOC features a Watch floor and is a communication, coordination and collaboration center. It is TSA's primary interface to the Department of Homeland Security's National Operations Center (NOC) for all transportation security issues and events.</p>
<p>Due to the amount of time required for on-boarding federal employees for performing these services, the government requires the continued involvement of the current contractor and its staff for the anticipated recurring need for these mission critical services. It is not feasible/cost effective to solicit a new contractor for this limited amount of time. To prevent a lapse in this mission critical service, the government intends to modify the current contract number HSTS03-07-C-CAC010 to allow for an extension of services. The existing contract expires October 31, 2012 and it is the government's intent to modify the existing contract to extend the period of performance for an initial period of three months with three (3) one month option periods to be utilized if needed. The extension will be performed under the same terms and conditions as the existing contract. The modification will be executed consistent with the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(2) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source.</p>
<p><br />Accordingly, the TSA intends to modify Contract&nbsp;number HSTS03-07-C-CAC010 with Professional Solutions LLC. 4809 B Eisenhower Ave, Alexandria VA 22304 for an extension of current services on a sole source basis. This contract modification will address the requirements of the TSA Personnel Security/Transportation Security Operation's Center (TSOC) Watch Officer Support Requirement.<br /><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.</p>
<p>The Government will notify parties of the outcome of any proposal submitted in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above vendor directly. This notice of intent/synopsis is being issued for information purposes only and it is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation documents are not available and telephone inquiries will not be accepted. Written challenges may be directed to Marlene Kratz via email at marlene.kratz@tsa.dhs.gov. If no responsive challenges are received by October 19, 2012, the contract modification will be executed with Professional Solutions LLC. without further notice.</p>

<DESC>Reference Solicitation 12-01-RQKD posted 7/17/2012 in FedBizOps.
<p>The objective is to establish a consortium not a manufacturing project. The objective of the NBMI is to accelerate risk assessment and the development of robust mitigation approaches for critical nano-bio materials and fabrication innovations by developing common technology and manufacturing platforms through public-private partnerships between federal laboratories, DoD acquisition centers, academia, US manufacturing enterprises, and commercial industries. To achieve this objective, the institute is envisioned to create a community of large and small companies, academia, federal laboratories, and the states to accelerate innovation by investing in industrially-relevant nano-bio manufacturing technologies. Ultimately, a fully functioning NBMI will have both virtual and physical entities that will enable partners to bridge the gap between basic research and product transition by developing verified and validated open architecture processing-design-performance, forecasting, and risk assessment tools for integration of new nano-bio materials and process technologies. Additionally, it will provide shared assets to help companies' access cutting-edge capabilities and equipment, and create an unparalleled environment to educate and train students and workers in advanced manufacturing skills. A successful institute will serve as a technical center of excellence, providing the infrastructure to support manufacturing enterprises at a prototype level that are relevant and scalable; and ensuring that the key capabilities for DoD needs is available.</p>

<DESC>Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 9 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.   

The General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing solicitation number 2FYA-AR-060004-B Refresh 20 for Multiple Award Schedule 738X for Human Resources & EEO Services, effective March 13, 2012. 2FYA-AR-060004-B Refresh 20 replaces solicitation number 2FYA-AR-060004-B Refresh 19 in its entirety.

Current contract holders under Schedule 738X for Human Resources & EEO Services do not need to re-apply. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this agency. Contracts under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award, and lasting for five years unless canceled or terminated. Three five-year option periods are possible under this contractual action.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC><strong>Synopsis</strong>: <br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61, effective 13 September 2012.
<p>USDA Rural Development (RD) in Michigan intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) to small business firms capable of providing appraisals for government-managed/owned single family properties. A BPA is not a contract. The Government is not obligated to place any orders nor is the vendor obligated to accept any orders. For each work assignment, the Government will request appraisal services by issuing a BPA call order to firms that have been awarded BPA's.</p>
<p>Individual call orders shall be submitted in accordance with the terms in the BPA. Government personnel authorized to place call orders under the BPA will be identified on the BPA's by name and telephone number. The contractor will be expected to furnish the service in accordance with the terms and conditions of the BPA, without the need for additional paperwork beyond the Statement of Work that accompanies the order. Timely delivery of complete and accurate appraisals is crucial to the success of RD programs. Call orders are to be completed within 7 business days of the call order date.</p>
<p><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong>: The contract period is October 1 2012 to September 30, 2013, with four optional fiscal years ending September 2017. The options may or may not be exercised by the Contracting Officer. The BPA may be cancelled by either party in writing at any time.</p>
<p><strong>STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS</strong>:<br />1) All appraisers must hold an active license in the State of Michigan as a State Licensed-, a Certified Residential-, or a Certified General Real Estate Appraiser. A limited real estate appraiser license is not acceptable for federally related transactions. In addition, Rural Development is required to contract directly with individual appraisers who are active and in good standing on the Appraisal Subcommittee website (www.asc.gov). This applies to subcontracted appraisers. For Single Family Housing Direct programs, agreements with AMCs are not permitted. All appraisers shall furnish license number and expiration date at the time of bid submission.<br /><br />2) Obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, which is a unique nine-character identification number provided by the commercial company Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). The online process at www.dnb.com (d-u-n-s number link) is free of charge and should be completed the same day. <br /><br />3) System for Acquisition Management (SAM) REGISTRATION: All vendors must maintain an active record in SAM, at www.sam.gov, to be awarded a BPA. It is advised that you begin this process as soon as possible since it can take about a week to complete. To make the process as efficient as possible, please review the online User and Quick Start guides. <br /><br />4) This is a Total Small Business Set Aside. The applicable NAICS code is 531320, with a business size standard of $2.0M. Please include this code in your SAM registration. Your firm and all affiliates must have total average revenue at or below this size.<br /><br />5) All appraisers must comply with the current edition of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) available at www.appraisalfoundation.org, agency appraisal requirements as described in Chapter 5 of RD-HB-3550-1, and 7 CFR 3550.62(a), as well as any instructions given by RD representatives.</p>
<p>The provisions of FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. Offerors must complete of the provisions of FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items in the SAM website. In addition, the provisions of FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items and FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items apply to this solicitation and are attached.</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION PROCEDURES</strong>: The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1) Technical Capacity - (New contractors) Provide a short narrative describing the offeror's technical ability to provide qualified personnel to perform the work described; the ability to provide quality work simultaneously on multiple services and to comply with the performance schedules.</p>
<p>2) Price - Submit a statement of prices for services. Your price list will apply for the duration of the fiscal year, and may be used to compare for task orders.</p>

<SUBJECT>Maintenance Dredging, Portsmouth Harbor & Piscataqua River
<SOLNBR>W912WJ12B0011
<RESPDATE>110812
<CONTACT>Kimberly Pumyea, Contracting Specialist, Phone 9783188720, Email kimberly.b.pumyea@usace.army.mil
<DESC><p>&nbsp;The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting contractors for maintenance dredging at Portsmouth Harbor and Piscataqua River in ME and NH.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The project is planned to be issued in on or about 20 August 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The construction window for dredging activities is between December 1, 2012 and March 15, 2013.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The estimated construction cost is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a bid to be considered by the New England District.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The project involves maintenance dredging and advance maintenance dredging to remove a total of about 15,000 cubic yards of sand and gravel from the authorized 35 foot deep channel in the Piscataqua River. The work involves removal of 3 distinct, relatively small shoal areas within the Simplex Reach. Advance maintenance dredging to -40' Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 2' allowable over-depth dredging will be performed on the primary shoal located adjacent to the Tyco Integrated Systems Company wharf (i.e. formerly the Simplex Wire and Cable Co. dock). Maintenance dredging to -35' MLLW plus 2' of allowable over-depth (i.e. 37' below MLLW) will be performed on the other two shoals; one located upstream of the primary shoal and one located downstream of the primary shoal. The dredged material will be placed at a previously-used, in-river disposal area, located about 3,000' seaward of the dredging area. Because of the dynamic nature of the area, it is anticipated that it will be necessary for the contractor to dredge to the allowable depths (i.e. -42' and -37' respectively) to positively clear the required depths of-40' and -35' below MLLW. The dredging window for this work is 1 Dec -15 Mar. Due to uncertain weather conditions and potential ice flows in the river, we are targeting the beginning of the dredging window to complete the work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Piscataqua River has one of the swiftest tidal currents of all of the commercial waterways in the U.S. Tidal currents can exceed 5 knots. Any dredging work is inherently dangerous, but it is especially critical when working during the winter months in relatively deep water, against swift tidal currents and around high vessel traffic that is involved in the transport of hazardous cargos in a densely populated area such as the international port of Portsmouth. The Contractor will be required to conduct the work in such a manner as to not obstruct navigation, and the contractor's plant will be required to be moved on the approach of any vessel to such an extent as may be necessary to afford a practicable passage.</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and</p>

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.</p>
<p>(3) If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.</p>

<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>(h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI program in Kyrgyzstan will support the objectives of the U.S. Embassy, the USAID Country Office in Kyrgyzstan (USAID/Kyrgyzstan), and the USAID Regional Mission to the Central Asian Republics (USAID/CAR) of (1) economic growth, (2) investing in people through health care and education, and (3) governing democratically and justly by strengthening parliament and local governance as well as civil society and media. The goals of the OTI program in Kyrgyzstan are to promote stability, decrease the chances of unrest, and facilitate efforts to restore core government functions.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner, manages an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities range across numerous sectors including but not limited to media, stabilization, and peace-building activities.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Asia Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or designee, and is based in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.  This post is a family-accompanied post and does allow minor and/or adult dependents.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Deputy Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative or designee, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	If required, travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	As appropriate, communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the US Embassy, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants, and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc.).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will report to OTI's Country Representative in the designated country.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position for the OTI Kyrgyzstan program, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>While in Kyrgyzstan, work is primarily performed in an office setting. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The Temporary Pharmacist will provide services for the inmates incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution and Federal Detention Center.</p>
<p>LOCATION OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The medical services will be performed in the Health Services Department at the Federal Correctional Institution and Federal Detention Center, Tallahassee, Florida. The contractor will be required to sign the contractor log indicating the date of visit to the institution along with the time of arrival and departure for security reasons.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Contract performance shall commence from the first day of assignment up to 120 workdays in a 24-month period. A workday will consist at least one (1) session and not exceed eight (8) sessions. The total duration of services will be consistent with the needs of the government, the availability of funds, and contractor performance. The Government reserves the right to extend the purchase order an additional 120 workdays, if required.</p>
<p>SCHEDULE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The contractor will provide pharmacist services during the absence of the institution's pharmacist, i.e. during periods of annual leave, sick leave, and training, as well as reassignment. The contractor will normally work, Monday through Friday (except for Federal holidays), normally between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., with thirty (30) minutes unpaid lunch period, (if applicable). A session will equal one (1) hour. Each contractor visit will normally consist of eight (8) sessions. The Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) will be responsible for defining the weekly schedule. These schedules are subject to change based on the variable needs of the institution and the unpredictable nature of the correctional environment. Upon agreement, any changes to the schedules must be coordinated with the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) assigned under the contract. Due to the nature of the correctional setting, delays in performance of work may be experienced. Such delays may include but are not limited to inclement weather, electrical or mechanical problems, or other security matters. When contract employees report to the institution but are unable to perform services due to such delays, the contractor will be paid for one (1) session. Normally, any remaining sessions for that day will be suspended and the contractor will be free to leave and will not be paid for remaining unperformed sessions. However, if the institution requests that the contractor remain at the institution for eventual performance, the contractor shall be paid for such sessions. In the event of any absence, the contractor shall provide replacement coverage. If the contractor fails to provide coverage, the Government may seek contractual remedy. At the beginning and end of each visit, the scheduled pharmacist will sign his/her name in a log book located in the FCI/FDCfront lobby/entrance. Payment for services will be based on actual scheduled sessions worked in accordance with the terms and pricing of the contract.</p>

Intro:
The Materials Science and Engineering field has seen in recent years a strong tendency to study materials that require properties linked to having a large fraction of surface atoms, as is the case of nanomaterials. Nanomaterials are formally defined as materials with features in the 100nm scale (1nm=10-9 m) and their properties differ from those of their bulk counterparts. At NPS, we are generating and characterizing nanomaterials such as Carbon Nanofibers (CNF), Carbon Nanotubes (CNT), Ceramics with Nanometer features (graphene, WS2 inorganic fullerenes) and metallic nanostructures, among others, as key ingredients in composites for armor applications.
 The characterization of those materials, ca. their morphological features (size, shape), is usually conducted with the aid of electron microscopes, which can provide information with resolution at those length scales. The mechanical properties of these materials have been studied by either methods traditionally used to analyze bulk materials or by Nanoindentation, when nanomaterials are part of a matrix or as a consolidated, compressed solid. Unfortunately, none of those options provide means to perform both: mechanical properties measurement and study of morphology at nanometer scale. We have been seeking an interface that will allow us to study the material under tension or compressive loads while observing it under the scanning electron microscope.
 Basically, we need a Tensile/Compressive test stage for SEM.

Objective of project:
Generate and characterize shock-resistant materials based on inorganic fullerene type tungsten disulfide (IF-WS2) and carbon nanocomposite structures for personal protection systems. The aim is centered in the development of a new generation of composites that combine the known energy absorbing properties of carbon nanomaterials (carbon nanofibers and graphene), with the shock absorbing properties reported for IF-WS2 structures.

No more questions will be accepted for this solicitation.

<DESC>The puropse of this amendment is to provide the question and response document, as well as, the amended RFQ, which take precedenace over the orginal RFQ.

Introduction:
The evaluation of a solid specimen under conditions of tensile or compressive loads can provide basic mechanical properties of the material. The former condition, the tensile test, is maybe the most common type of mechanical test in Materials Science. During this examination the ends of a sample of particular dimensions are fixed in the instrument and the sample then subjected to a uniaxial load that makes it elongate until it fails. Some of the data obtained this way are tensile strength, area reduction and elongation. The derived properties that can be obtained include Young modulus, Yield strength, Poissons ratio and and other material data such as Strain - hardening behavior.
 Compressive tests are conducted under similar conditions although the load is applied inward, crushing the specimen, shortening its dimension and pushing its parts together, usually a prevalent way to test brittle materials such as ceramics.
For our research, a Bench Top Single Column Material Test Instrument could be used both in tensile and compressive modes. On an exemplary embodiment the tensile-compressive loads will be applied while the sample electrical properties will be measured by an independent system. 

Objective of project:
Generate and characterize shock-resistant materials based on inorganic fullerene type tungsten disulfide (IF-WS2) and carbon nanocomposite structures for personal protection systems.
 The aim is centered in the development of a new generation of composites that combine the known energy absorbing properties of carbon nanomaterials (carbon nanofibers and graphene), with the shock absorbing properties reported for IF-WS2 structures.
As part of RIP project we are developing Carbon based materials with the objective of developing pressure transducers.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br /></p>

<p>Quantity ranges and delivery schedule will be noted on the RFP. FOB Destination is required. Inspection/Acceptance requirements will be noted on RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote, which shall be considered. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability of providing a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>F-35 Joint Program Office Sustainment Industry Day
<p>1. INTRODUCTION<br />The F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) is sponsoring an unclassified Industry Day to identify potential business sources with the resources, capabilities, and experience to successfully deliver a wide range of hardware and infrastructure services in support of F-35 JPO sustainment. The F-35 JPO requires support in the following sustainment functional areas: (1) Supply Chain Management (SCM); (2) Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS); (3) Training Systems; and (4) Support Equipment. This Industry Day will encompass all four (4) topics. The results of this Industry Day will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process. The F-35 JPO has scheduled the Industry Day for 14 -15 November 2012 in the Washington DC metro area. The exact time and location will be provided as an amendment to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will provide a general overview of F-35 JPO sustainment requirements, a forum to ask questions, and a chance to have a one-on-one session with the Government. Following the Industry Day presentation on 14 November 2012, the Government will host one-on-one sessions with interested companies, along with their anticipated subcontractor team, provided prior coordination with the Government is established. The one-on-one sessions give companies a chance to ask specific questions regarding the program that they did not want to share during the presentation. These sessions will be limited to 30 minutes and will be held in the afternoon on 14 November 2012 and between 08:00 - 17:00 on 15 November 2012 (16 November will be an overflow day). Session times will be randomly assigned and companies will be notified of their time slot via email.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a contract, a request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement, nor will the Government return any data provided. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the FBO website located at https://www.fbo.gov. It is the potential offerors' responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND<br />The F-35 JPO is a joint, multi-national program, and is the Department of Defense's (DoD's) focal point for defining affordable next generation strike aircraft weapon systems among the U.S. Air Force (USAF), U.S. Navy (USN), U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), and eight cooperative international participants: the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark, and Norway. The program objective is to develop and deploy a three-variant family of highly common and affordable fifth generation strike fighter aircraft that meet the operational needs of the USAF, USN, USMC, and cooperative international services. Additional production of the F-35 will be made through Foreign Military Sales (FMS). The F-35 program is a DoD Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program. The Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) is the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).</p>
<p>3. OBJECTIVES <br />The F-35 JPO has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for F-35 sustainment, including the competitive approach; solicitation, evaluation, and award methodology; contract vehicle; socio-economic considerations; scope or hardware/services; delivery schedule/period of performance; rough order of magnitude/budget; intended number of contract awards; or acquisition timeline. The F-35 JPO intends to use information provided in response to this RFI, in addition to other market research, to refine its acquisition strategy and to evaluate alternatives that will deliver the best value, long-term F-35 sustainment solution. This supports the broader F-35 JPO goals of increased affordability, transparency, predictability, and accountability for sustainment costs and performance.</p>
<p>4. SUSTAINMENT FUNCTIONAL AREAS</p>
<p>The Industry Day will provide presentations and host one-on-one sessions on the following sustainment functional areas:</p>
<p>Supply Chain Management: The F-35 plans to utilize Performance Based Logistics (PBL) to allow the Government customers to purchase, via the JPO, a package of support structured to meet each Government's operational requirements and optimize readiness of the F-35 Air System, including Supply Chain Management (SCM) support. It is the intent of the F-35 JPO to take maximum advantage of existing public and private capabilities to achieve the balance between affordability and performance. In that light, the following areas represent the SCM functions under consideration for competition:<br />a. Shipping Containers<br />b. Deactivation, Demilitarization &amp; Disposal<br />c. Regional Warehousing <br />d. Transportation &amp; Distribution Services for Spares</p>
<p>Support Equipment: The F-35 JPO would like to identify companies with the capability to manufacture and/or supply various items of ground support equipment (SE). The JPO will consider various types of manufacturing processes to support the F-35 JPO maintenance tasks, including but not limited to mechanical/weldments, electrical, and critical machining. Along with SE, various types of tools will be required, such as torque wrenches, screwdrivers, adapters, and gauges. The following areas represent the SE functions under consideration for competition:<br /><br />a. Manufacture and/or supply various F-35 Air System and Propulsion SE for USAF, USN, USMC, and cooperative international services<br />b. Manufacture and/or supply various hand tools to perform proper aircraft maintenance<br />c. Provide calibration capabilities for Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment</p>
<p><strong>Autonomic Logistics Information System: The Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) is an integrated part of the F-35 Air System. It is designed to fulfill the requirement for an intelligent information infrastructure that binds all of the key concepts of Autonomic Logistics Global Sustainment (ALGS) into an effective overall support system. ALIS provides a comprehensive tool for data collection, data analysis, decision support and action tracking. Additionally, ALIS represents that component of ALGS which establishes the appropriate interfaces between and among the Air Vehicle (AV), the War Fighter, the Training System (TS), the Support System (SS), supporting commercial enterprise systems, and government Information Technology (IT) systems from the domains of logistics support, training management, operations, and command and control. It is a single autonomic logistics solution required to satisfy all United States and Partner Nations Service needs. The requirement includes hardware technical refresh at operational and Maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) facilities, on-site administration of ALIS in support of all variants of the F-35 at home stations, MRO facilities, and deployed locations. The following areas represent the ALIS functions under consideration for competition:<br />a. Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) administration of ALIS<br />b. Develop and deliver ALIS Administrator training</strong></p>
<p>Simulation Training Services: The F-35 JPO would like to identify companies with the capability to support F-35 training devices and provide training services at the Academic Training Center (ATC). The following areas represent the Simulation Training Services functions under consideration for competition: <br />a. Training Device Support <br />i. Pilot Training Devices (Full Mission Simulators, Deployable Mission Rehearsal Trainer and Mission Rehearsal Trainer) <br />ii. Maintenance Training Devices (Aircraft System Maintenance Trainer/Electronically Mediated Lecture, Ejection Seat Maintenance Trainer, Weapon Load Trainer, F135 Engine Module Separation, Accessories Removal and Installation and Lift Fan Clutch Assembly Repair and Outer Mold Line Restoration Training Lab)<br />b. Training Services at the Academic Training Center<br />i. Training Center Operations, Physical, Information and Operational Security, and Training Infrastructure System <br /><br />5. INDUSTRY DAY REGISTRATION<br />Pre-registration is REQUIRED. This is a no-fee event and seating is limited to two (2) individuals for each company as there is limited seating. Companies are required to e-mail Scott Ostrow, F-35 Contract Specialist @ scott.ostrow@jsf.mil no later than 4:00 PM (EST) on 15 October 2012, the following pre-registration information: (1) Company Name, (2) Company size under the applicable NAICS codes (Small Business Administration business size classification), (3) CAGE Code, (4) a one page company profile, (5) Name(s) of employees/representatives attending Industry Day, and (6) if you are a Prime Offeror, whether your company would be interested in participating in one-on-one discussions. Attendee substitution requests may be submitted to the same point of contact by 4:00 PM (EST) on 07 November 2012. All firms must be registered in Central Contractor Registry (CCR) to be eligible for award of Government contracts. Electronic responses shall be submitted in Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel format, or Portable Document Format (PDF).</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Attendees will be required to present a CURRENT Government issued photo ID (driver's license, military ID, or passport) matching the information provided above upon check-in. Please allow sufficient time for the check-in/verification process. Late registration and "walk-in" requests will NOT be permitted.</p>
<p>Hard copies of the presentation materials will not be provided at the Industry Day, but will be posted to the FBO website on 18 October 2012. Specific questions regarding the presentation materials must be submitted to the registration point of contact no later than 4:00 PM (EST) on 07 November 2012 via e-mail.

<DESC>F-35 Joint Program Office Sustainment Industry Day
<p>1. INTRODUCTION<br />The F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) is sponsoring an unclassified Industry Day to identify potential business sources with the resources, capabilities, and experience to successfully deliver a wide range of hardware and infrastructure services in support of F-35 JPO sustainment. The F-35 JPO requires support in the following sustainment functional areas: (1) Supply Chain Management (SCM); (2) Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS); (3) Training Systems; and (4) Support Equipment. This Industry Day will encompass all four (4) topics. The results of this Industry Day will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process. The F-35 JPO has scheduled the Industry Day for 14 -15 November 2012 in the Washington DC metro area. The exact time and location will be provided as an amendment to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will provide a general overview of F-35 JPO sustainment requirements, a forum to ask questions, and a chance to have a one-on-one session with the Government. Following the Industry Day presentation on 14 November 2012, the Government will host one-on-one sessions with interested companies, along with their anticipated subcontractor team, provided prior coordination with the Government is established. The one-on-one sessions give companies a chance to ask specific questions regarding the program that they did not want to share during the presentation. These sessions will be limited to 30 minutes and will be held in the afternoon on 14 November 2012 and between 08:00 - 17:00 on 15 November 2012 (16 November will be an overflow day). Session times will be randomly assigned and companies will be notified of their time slot via email.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a contract, a request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement, nor will the Government return any data provided. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the FBO website located at https://www.fbo.gov. It is the potential offerors' responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND<br />The F-35 JPO is a joint, multi-national program, and is the Department of Defense's (DoD's) focal point for defining affordable next generation strike aircraft weapon systems among the U.S. Air Force (USAF), U.S. Navy (USN), U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), and eight cooperative international participants: the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark, and Norway. The program objective is to develop and deploy a three-variant family of highly common and affordable fifth generation strike fighter aircraft that meet the operational needs of the USAF, USN, USMC, and cooperative international services. Additional production of the F-35 will be made through Foreign Military Sales (FMS). The F-35 program is a DoD Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program. The Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) is the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).</p>
<p>3. OBJECTIVES <br />The F-35 JPO has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for F-35 sustainment, including the competitive approach; solicitation, evaluation, and award methodology; contract vehicle; socio-economic considerations; scope or hardware/services; delivery schedule/period of performance; rough order of magnitude/budget; intended number of contract awards; or acquisition timeline. The F-35 JPO intends to use information provided in response to this RFI, in addition to other market research, to refine its acquisition strategy and to evaluate alternatives that will deliver the best value, long-term F-35 sustainment solution. This supports the broader F-35 JPO goals of increased affordability, transparency, predictability, and accountability for sustainment costs and performance.</p>
<p>4. SUSTAINMENT FUNCTIONAL AREAS</p>
<p>The Industry Day will provide presentations and host one-on-one sessions on the following sustainment functional areas:</p>
<p>Supply Chain Management: The F-35 plans to utilize Performance Based Logistics (PBL) to allow the Government customers to purchase, via the JPO, a package of support structured to meet each Government's operational requirements and optimize readiness of the F-35 Air System, including Supply Chain Management (SCM) support. It is the intent of the F-35 JPO to take maximum advantage of existing public and private capabilities to achieve the balance between affordability and performance. In that light, the following areas represent the SCM functions under consideration for competition:<br />a. Shipping Containers<br />b. Deactivation, Demilitarization &amp; Disposal<br />c. Regional Warehousing <br />d. Transportation &amp; Distribution Services for Spares</p>
<p><strong>Support Equipment: The F-35 JPO would like to identify companies with the capability to manufacture and/or supply various items of ground support equipment (SE). The JPO will consider various types of manufacturing processes to support the F-35 JPO maintenance tasks, including but not limited to mechanical/weldments, electrical, and critical machining. Along with SE, various types of tools will be required, such as torque wrenches, screwdrivers, adapters, and gauges. The following areas represent the SE functions under consideration for competition:<br /><br />a. Manufacture and/or supply various F-35 Air System and Propulsion SE for USAF, USN, USMC, and cooperative international services<br />b. Manufacture and/or supply various hand tools to perform proper aircraft maintenance<br />c. Provide calibration capabilities for Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment</strong></p>
<p>Autonomic Logistics Information System: The Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) is an integrated part of the F-35 Air System. It is designed to fulfill the requirement for an intelligent information infrastructure that binds all of the key concepts of Autonomic Logistics Global Sustainment (ALGS) into an effective overall support system. ALIS provides a comprehensive tool for data collection, data analysis, decision support and action tracking. Additionally, ALIS represents that component of ALGS which establishes the appropriate interfaces between and among the Air Vehicle (AV), the War Fighter, the Training System (TS), the Support System (SS), supporting commercial enterprise systems, and government Information Technology (IT) systems from the domains of logistics support, training management, operations, and command and control. It is a single autonomic logistics solution required to satisfy all United States and Partner Nations Service needs. The requirement includes hardware technical refresh at operational and Maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) facilities, on-site administration of ALIS in support of all variants of the F-35 at home stations, MRO facilities, and deployed locations. The following areas represent the ALIS functions under consideration for competition:<br />a. Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) administration of ALIS<br />b. Develop and deliver ALIS Administrator training</p>
<p>Simulation Training Services: The F-35 JPO would like to identify companies with the capability to support F-35 training devices and provide training services at the Academic Training Center (ATC). The following areas represent the Simulation Training Services functions under consideration for competition: <br />a. Training Device Support <br />i. Pilot Training Devices (Full Mission Simulators, Deployable Mission Rehearsal Trainer and Mission Rehearsal Trainer) <br />ii. Maintenance Training Devices (Aircraft System Maintenance Trainer/Electronically Mediated Lecture, Ejection Seat Maintenance Trainer, Weapon Load Trainer, F135 Engine Module Separation, Accessories Removal and Installation and Lift Fan Clutch Assembly Repair and Outer Mold Line Restoration Training Lab)<br />b. Training Services at the Academic Training Center<br />i. Training Center Operations, Physical, Information and Operational Security, and Training Infrastructure System <br /><br />5. INDUSTRY DAY REGISTRATION<br />Pre-registration is REQUIRED. This is a no-fee event and seating is limited to two (2) individuals for each company as there is limited seating. Companies are required to e-mail Scott Ostrow, F-35 Contract Specialist @ scott.ostrow@jsf.mil no later than 4:00 PM (EST) on 15 October 2012, the following pre-registration information: (1) Company Name, (2) Company size under the applicable NAICS codes (Small Business Administration business size classification), (3) CAGE Code, (4) a one page company profile, (5) Name(s) of employees/representatives attending Industry Day, and (6) if you are a Prime Offeror, whether your company would be interested in participating in one-on-one discussions.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a requirement for a contractor to provide backup child and elder care services to be offered by the SEC for its employees nation-wide. The SEC has two locations in the Washington Metropolitan Area and 11 regional offices. The SEC Headquarters (Station Place) is located in downtown Washington, DC next to Union Station, the SEC Operations Center is located in Alexandria, VA and the Regional offices are located in the cities of Atlanta GA, Boston MA, Chicago IL, Denver CO, Fort Worth TX, Los Angeles CA, Miami FL, New York NY, Philadelphia PA, Salt Lake City UT, and San Francisco CA.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking a contractor to provide SEC employees with a 24 hour online and telephonic centralized registration and placement service for child and elder care recipients. The SEC is not seeking a registry service. The SEC is seeking a professionally staffed center with care specialists who will minimize employee time and effort in obtaining care. The contractor shall vet the providers in advance. The contractor shall provide Care Specialists who will provide placement options for child and elder care recipients. Care recipients include dependent child, "mildly-ill child" and elderly (adult) family members. Contactor shall establish a system for processing requests for backup child and elder care services from a comprehensive nation-wide network of licensed and qualified child care centers and in-home care providers. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform backup child and elder care services.</p>
<p>This contract shall provide geographic flexibility, so that employees can choose centers and in-home providers either close to home or close to work as needed. Additionally, SEC employees travel to cities across the country on SEC business.

<DESC>M67854-13-R-2009- Medium Hybrid Expeditionary Energy System (MHEES)
<p>Marine Corps Systems Command intends to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the potential award up to two (2) contracts for the Research, Development, and Prototype fabrication of a Medium Hybrid Expeditionary Energy System (MHEES). The contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP), "C" type contracts. It is anticipated that the RFP will be released in the next 60 days. All contracts will have base efforts that perform initial analysis, design efforts, and fabrication/delivery of prototypes. The period of performance for this effort will be twenty-four&nbsp;(24) months.&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No RFP exists at this time</span></strong>.<br /><br />To increase energy independence and flexibility of deployment options, the Marine Corps has been fielding renewable and hybrid energy programs to include the Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy Network System (GREENS). Need for improvement exists with this type of system to meet future Marine Corps&nbsp;mission needs for mobility and power. The goal of this improvement will be to address the next level of power capability above the GREENS type system, while developing the smallest, lightest and most cost effective system at this increased power level.</p>

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES.
<p>1.1 Background. The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) mission is to provide air, land, and sea distribution for the Department of Defense (DOD), both during peace and war. The Commander (CDR) of USTRANSCOM is tasked as the single manager of the Defense Distribution System (DDS). An important functional requirement is the integration of the Transportation Component Commands (TCCs): Military Sealift Command (MSC), HQ Air Mobility Command (AMC), and Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC). Financial analyses thread through the various TCJ8 projects in ensuring effectiveness and efficiencies are documented for decision making.</p>
