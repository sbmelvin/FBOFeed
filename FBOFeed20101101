<DESC>The purpose of this posting is to publish a pre-solicitation notice and the Draft Request For Proposal (RFP) in order to provide interested parties with additional information regarding this procurement. The Draft RFP will be released incrementally as this document becomes available. Potential Offerors are encouraged to review FedBizOpps for updates. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this notice and provide feedback. Any forthcoming formal RFP will be posted to FedBizOpps without an additional pre-solicitation notice. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. <br /><br />The AAC/ EBDZ/ EBDK, Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) Program, will be conducting a competitive source selection in FY11 for the JPF Follow-on Production program. The current JPF system includes the fuze, cable, fuze bomb initiator and a retaining ring. The contract will include seven (7) JPF Follow-on Production lots (Lots 8-14) for U.S. Government and FMS, technical support, non-warranty repairs, trainers, spares, instrumented fuzes, and sled test support. The Air Force acquisition strategy for the follow-on production contract is to begin deliveries no later than 24 months after contract award.<br />&nbsp;<br />The JPF is a multifunction, multi-delay tail fuze system with hardened target capability for use in general purpose and penetrating unitary warheads. The JPF operates with a wide variety of guidance kits, high and low drag fins, and with all configurations of the DSU-33 proximity sensor (which provides an airburst capability). When used with the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), the JPF operating mode and other settings may be selected in flight from the cockpit through a serial TIA-422 interface between the weapon and fuze. The objective of the JPF Follow-on Production program is to procure a JPF that, as a minimum, meets all the requirements of the Systems Requirements Document and is fully integrated and qualified for employment. <br /><br />Potential Offerors would be required to provide a fully qualified JPF that has documentation verifying that each requirement of the SRD has been met including compatibility with the MK-80 series (MK-82, MK-83, MK-84, including the BLU-110, BLU-111, BLU-121, and BLU-126) and penetrator warheads (BLU-109, BLU-113, BLU-122). The proposed fuze system must also be compatible for use in all JDAM variants, GBU 10/12/15/16/24/27/28 weapon systems, as well as the basic "dumb" bomb configurations and the AGM-130. In addition to weapons compatibility, the JPF must be qualified and certified on the following aircraft: B-1B, B-2A, B-52H, F-15E, F-16C/D, F-22, A-10, and MQ-9A. The Government funding profile for this acquisition is production funding, with no development funds available. This procurement does not include any technology development. The Offeror must propose a Systems Performance Specification that meets or exceeds the requirements of the Systems Requirements Document. At a minimum, the Offeror must have the capability to produce at a rate of 1,800 systems per month for the duration of the contract period, although actual Lot quantities are likely to be less. The offeror must also provide shipping to CONUS locations and also provide adequate production, test, logistics support, shipping and containers. All JPF components will be subject to lot acceptance testing. <br /><br />We anticipate this procurement will be limited to Qualified U.S. Contractors. Prime contractors would then be allowed to request export license for participation of foreign companies as subcontractors. This program contains classified elements and export control data that will not be released on FedBizOpps. Potential prime contractor sources are requested to provide a statement of intent to submit a proposal as a prime contractor in response to the Formal RFP. The JPF Program Office has a technical data package that will be provided (for informational purposes only) electronically upon request from potential prime contractors that meet the conditions to be considered a "Qualified U.S. Contractor" IAW DoD Directive 5230.25. Potential prime contractors expressing their written intent to submit a proposal for this effort will also be given the opportunity to have a one-on-one session with the program office at the upcoming Industry Day event currently scheduled for 16 November 2010. One-on-one sessions will be continued on 17 November 2010 in the event that this additional date is necessary. One-on-one sessions will be scheduled on a first- come, first-served basis upon request to the Contracting Officer. Requests must be received NLT 10 November 2010 to be considered for a one-on-one session. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. <br /><br />In response to the Draft RFP issued, the AAC/EBDK/EBDZ program will accept comments submitted to the Contracting Officer, Leanne T. Green, at Leanne.green@eglin.af.mil. The subject line should clearly read: "Response to Draft RFP FA8681-11-R-0037." Potential Offerors should submit all comments as a single request no later than 29 November 2010. The Program Office intends to provide responses to non-proprietary questions/comments via FedBizOpps. Any proprietary questions/comments should be clearly marked.<br />&nbsp;<br />This Draft RFP does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future, and thus does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this Draft RFP. All costs associated with responding to this Draft RFP will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this Draft RFP does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of the Draft RFP respondent to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br /><br />An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of Offerors or potential Offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above. The primary Ombudsman is Col David A. Harris, AAC/CV and the alternate Ombudsman is Col Edward J. McAllister III, AAC/CS both located at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495, phone number (850) 882-5422, DSN 872-5422.

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />FA8651-11-R-0379 Optimized Array for Space-Background Infrared Simulation (OASIS) 512
<p>Notice Type: <br />Presolicitation Notice</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Contracting Division, intends to solicit and award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Santa Barbara Infrared (SBIR) Inc., 30 S. Calle Ceasar Chavez, Santa Barbara, CA to perform follow-on efforts for integrating residual OASIS 512 emitter arrays into 512-by-512 element cryogenic infrared emitter array modules. The effort includes upgrades to the original OASIS 512 design, integration and packaging of the modules, functional testing and delivery of five OASIS 512 packaged modules. Due to their exclusive license of this technology for emitter array applications, the only known responsible source that can satisfy this requirement is SBIR. Additionally, residual emitter wafers from a previous contract effort with SBIR have been stored in a specialized environment and are to be used in the performance of this effort. Taking the wafers out of that environment to use as Government Furnished Property to another contractor would damage the wafers so they would no longer be useable. The anticipated award date is 30 Nov 2010 and the contract performance period is anticipated to be 12 months.</p>
<p>FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii) requires that all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. All responses must be received 15 calendar days after the date of this posting.</p>
<p>AFFARS 5352.201-9101 is applicable to this procurement. The AFRL Ombudsman is Ms. Karen Sue Hunter, AFRL/PK, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, (937) 904-4407, Karen.hunter@wpafb.af.mil.</p>
<p>Communication concerning this acquisition should be directed to Randy Miller, Contract Specialist, at (850) 883-2674 (randy.miller@eglin.af.mil), or Laura Klepper, Contracting Officer, at (850) 882-4296 (laura.klepper@eglin.af.mil).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Waters Corporation, 34 Maple Street, Milford, Massachusetts 01757-3696 for the procurement of Waters Service Contract for Waters High Performance Liquid Chromatography Systems (HPLC).

The sole source determination is based upon the results of the market research conducted by the Government which determined that Waters Corporations is the manufacturer of the HPLC systems.  The preventative maintenance and repairs can only be performed by the manufacturer.  No other vendor can provide the necessary parts, software support, or technical expertise needed for these systems.  Parts and accessory items must be compatible with this existing equipment. The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) and the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease program (TRND) mission is of the NCGC is such that successful realization of the ambitious and complex goals of this center requires an intermingling of scientific disciplines; namely biology, informatics and chemistry.  The long term goals are to develop chemical probes for every protein encoded by the genome, and to identify the complement of chemical space that is needed to cover all of biological space.  

Mission one for the chemistry team is the follow-up and optimization chemistry on actives derived within the screening network.  In order to successfully accomplish this mission, the chemistry team must be capable of the fast and efficient synthesis and purification of small molecules.  Synthetic organic chemistry can be broken down into three main processes.  First  the combination of chemical reagents in a fashion that predictive reactions occur and novel chemical matter is created.  These reactions are done in step-wise fashion ultimately producing compounds of biochemical interest and use.  The second aspect of synthetic chemistry is the purification of the products you want.  This is an essential component, as unwanted byproducts poison reactions and complicate biological appreciation.  The third aspect is the characterization of these constructs to assure that a scientist has made what he/she predicted would be made.  Each of these steps requires its own unique infrastructure, equipment and skills.  If any aspect of this progression is defunct, the entirety of the process is compromised.  Thus, the use of numerous state of the art instrumentations continues to be a necessity for the NCGC chemistry team to accomplish its mission.
 
Contractor Requirements:

The Contractor must be able to provide the technical expertise, along with software, hardware and accessory parts to keep our three Waters HPLC systems currently in use by our center up and running on a continuous basis.  This equipment is essential to our high production chemistry area and any delays in down time would be extremely detrimental to our facility.  The Contractor must provide the needed expertise in order to limit the down time and maintain system failure to a minimum.  The Analytical Chemistry department depends on this equipment every day for the correct evaluation of these compounds.  The Chemistry Department, in conducting research, needs to assess the biological utility of small molecules prepared in the laboratory.  This determination relies on the purity and correct identity of the compound of interest. These three HPLC systems requested for this service agreement are crucial in the identification and purification of these compounds.  Because these systems are such a key tool in this purification and identification step they are very high use in our laboratory and it is necessary that they are operating correctly with as little down time as possible.  

The Contractor will provide responsive interaction when a system fails, a timely and accurate plan of action, and the repair including supplying the parts and accessories needed to get the broken units back on line within a timely manner.  Waters Corporations is the only source for the technical expertise along with the needed parts and accessories in which service must be maintained in as short a time period as possible.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, with business size standard 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-46 (October 29, 2010). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by November 5, 2010, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2011-009-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Dorothy Maxwell.  Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADING UNTIL APPROXIMATELY November 1, 2010.

On or about November 1, 2010 a solicitation for an Environmental Multiple Award Contract (EMAC) for Naval Station Great Lakes Area of Responsibility (AOR) will be posted on FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov).  The preponderance of the work is at the Naval Station Great Lakes, Illinois, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) - Crane, Indiana, and Naval Support Activity Millington, Tennessee.  However, other locations nationwide as deemed necessary may be included to meet workload requirements.  Historically, volumes, of work have been performed at various locations throughout the following states:  Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Oklahoma, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.
 This procurement is 100% set-a side for competitive Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms located in the contiguous United States.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 562910.  The Government's objective is to obtain services, including all labor, material, transportation, equipment, and supervision required to provide environmental services entailing a wide range of projects; such as, but not limited to: AST/UST removal and/or replacement; remediation and testing; asbestos, lead and mold abatement; facility decontamination and demolition; soil and groundwater sampling and remediation; site characterization and assessment; hazardous and environmental waste documentation, handling, treatment, and disposal; landfill maintenance and repair; unexploded ordinance removal and disposal; long term monitoring and operation and maintenance of remediation facilities; along with wetland and dredging operations.
  Offerors must have an established reputation (or, if newly organized, whose personnel have previously established a reputation in the field) that is regularly engaged in and that maintains a regular staff of employees with necessary certifications and licenses.  Such certifications and licenses include, but are not limited to the following: asbestos, lead, hazardous waste, environmental cleanup, health and safety, sampling and analysis, air monitoring, noise analysis, as well as geological, hydro-geological and environmental engineering design and oversight.  Offerors shall demonstrate the ability to have performed this work on previous projects. The solicitation will result in between three to five MAC awards.
  The preponderance of the work will be between $10,000 and $8,000,000.  The contract vehicle may have occasional projects ranging from $3.5 million to $8 million.  The contracts will be for a 12 month base year and potential four option years.  The estimated maximum value for all contracts is $40,000,000. Performance and payment bonds are required. All interested firms must have bonding capability of $8,000,000.

Proposers will be evaluated using the two-phase request for proposal procedures that result in awards based on best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

The Government will request for proposals (RFP) from firms in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and Navy/Marine Corps Acquisition Guide for a competitive negotiated procurement utilizing a Two-Phase selection procedure similar to the procedures located at FAR 36.3.
  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides best value to the Government.  In accordance with FAR 36.3, this procurement will consist of two phases.  

Phase I is the pre-qualification phase.  Phase I factors relate to the five year ID/IQ contract requirements for environmental services as listed above.  A minimum of five firms will be pre-qualified in Phase I and will participate and advance to Phase II technical solutions and price. The evaluation factors for Phase I are as follows:   Factor 1 - Past Performance, Factor 2 - Specialized Experience, Factor 3  Contract Management.
  

In Phase II, the selected Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals for the seed project.  Offerors who fail to submit their Phase II technical and price proposals will not be considered for award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a proposal addressing the following: Technical Approach  Task Order (0001), Task Order 0001 Project Approach, Task Order 0001 Team Organization and Experience, Task Order 0001 Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan, Task Order 0001 Technical Approach Breakdown and Task Order 0001 Project Milestone Schedule.  Price proposals may include total price evaluation within the Governments published budget for award.  The best value offeror will receive a contract for the seed project.
  The remaining best value offerors selected will receive a Multiple Award Contract that will include a minimum guarantee of $1,000.  Should one or more of the MAC Contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate that task order with only that offeror.

As the solicitation will be issued via the internet, all prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  All contractors are encouraged to attempt to download prior to obtaining the solicitation through alternate sources.  Many firms and commercial printing services have the capability to print the solicitation package and plan holders list off the internet, if necessary.
  The official plan holders list will be created by registration and will be available from the website only.  Amendments will also be posted on the website for downloading.  This will be the normal method for distributing amendments; therefore, it is the offerors responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.

FOLLOW-ON WORK AFTER AWARD: The successful offerors awarded a MAC contract in Phase II will compete on future task orders.  Offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Participation in the pre-proposal conferences or site visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.
 The task order statements of work may be written based on Government/Contractor team cooperative scoping of the work. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or lowest price technically acceptable. If the Government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. 

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  All contractors submitting bids, proposals, or quotes on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of the contract.  The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government.
  The CCR website can be accessed at www.ccr.gov.  Reference is made to DFARS Clause 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration.  All new contracts can ONLY be made to contractors who are registered in CCR.  This requirement will apply to all solicitations and awards, regardless of the media used.

For inquiries about the Phase I proposal, please contact Ms. Amy Franks, 847-688-2600 extension 415 or email amy.franks@navy.mil.

<a href="mailto:Daniels.Ryan@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 611310   The US EPA/OAR Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the University of Virginia of Charlottesville, VA for site locationdocumentation information for streams in Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland.  The period of performance will be from the date of award through November 7, 2011.  
The justification is as follows.  The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain specific site location documentation information for streams in Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland.  The service rendered to EPA under this procurement is to produce and deliver valid site documentation data and site attribute information (geographic coordinates, elevation, site maps and photographic images files).  As of September 1, 2010, University of Virginia has taken over sampling of water chemistry at these 32 stream monitoring sites.  University of Virginia will be using this site documentation and access information during the sampling of these sites.  The use of another source would create a duplicate effort as the University of Virginia would still have to visit the sites before the sampling could commence.  Additionally, University of Virginia researchers have worked extensively in the region and have unique, established partnerships with local land owners and the U.S. Forest Service.  These relationships are vital for gaining access to the stream sites and a history of working in the area is a key component to ensuring that access privileges remain or are granted.  
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Synopsis of the proposed dredging  South Brother Island Channel of the East River, NY Federal Navigation Project<BR><BR>The New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposes to perform maintenance dredging in the South Brother Island Channel of the East River, NY Federal Navigation Project, with subsequent placement of the dredged material at the Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS).  The proposed maintenance dredging would remove up to a maximum of 300,000 cubic yards of sediment (approx. 225,000 cubic yards as basic work and the remaining 75,000 cubic yards as options) to a depth of 35 ft. below Mean Low Water (MLW) with 2 ft allowable over-depth.  <BR>Due to restrictions found in the water quality certificate, the proposed work must/can only be performed by a large mechanical dredge with a closed environmental clamshell bucket.  Additional multiple barges and tug boats are needed to perform the work during dredging, transport and placement of the dredged material.<BR>The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him the notice to proceed, to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the basic work ready for use not later than seventy five (75) calendar days after the receipt by them of the notice to proceed.

The contractor is required to maintain an integrated production of at least 4,000 cubic yards per calendar day.  <BR>The work is estimated to cost between $2,500,000 and $4,000,000 (basic and options).  Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 15 November 2010, with bid opening on/about 20 December 2010.

<CONTACT>Sara E Lawlyes, Procuring Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 653-3451, Email sara.lawlyes@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Global Positioning Systems Wing (GPSW), Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA intends to modify the existing GPS Advanced Control Segment (OCX) contract (FA8807-10-C-0001) with Raytheon Company, 16800 E CentreTech Pkwy, Aurora, CO 80011-9046, (972) 205-4293, to take delivery of a Launch and Checkout System (LCS) capability, which is a subset of OCX Block 1.0. This effort will provide Launch and Early Orbit Operations (LEO), bus and payload checkout of the GPS IIIA Space Vehicle, interim contractor support, support for transition to operations, and associated contractor sustainment activities.
<p>The contractor will perform engineering, development, testing, training, and related activities to deliver LCS, which is a subset of OCX Block 1.0. The Government will provide the LCS as Government Property (GP) to the GPS IIIA Prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, for installation at Lockheed Martin's facility in Newtown, PA, or in another facility selected by the Government. The LCS must be installed, checked out, and fully operational by first quarter of calendar year 2014 to support the first GPS IIIA Space Vehicle (SV-1) launch scheduled for May 2014. The Government will then use LCS to launch and perform bus and payload checkout of all Lockheed Martin-developed GPS III satellites. As a part of this effort, the Government intends to provide future instances of OCX Block 1.0 and Block 2.0 as updated GP versions of LCS to Lockheed Martin with selectively enabled functions determined by the then current Government CONOPS. This approach will ensure the same OCX software configuration will support launch, checkout, end-to-end test, and potentially other operations of all GPS satellites at the selected LCS facility and at the OCX Master Control Station and Alternate Master Control Station. This approach is designed to enable future sustainment and operation of a single OCX-based system to launch, checkout, operate, sustain, and support the entire GPS constellation through all states of its constituent satellites from launch through disposal.</p>
<p>The LCS is required to prevent unacceptable delays in supporting the launch of GPS IIIA SV-1 and the subsequent bus and payload checkout. The timely launch of GPS IIIA SV-1 is critical in meeting constellation availability, as well as providing an opportunity to fully complete end-to-end ground and on orbit test activities and to ensure follow-on satellite production will not be impacted by late discovery of design or workmanship problems.</p>
<p>The Government does not anticipate another offeror can meet the required project timelines with an alternative that does not result in substantial duplication of Government costs and intends to award a sole-source contract modification to Raytheon Company.</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) no later than 15 working days after posting of the subject notice/Sources Sought Synopsis. The SOC must include the following information: Company Name, Mailing Address, Point of Contact and Telephone Numbers, Business Size Classification (Large, Small, or Other), Personnel/Size Standard and experience-specific work previously performed or being performed relevant to this follow-on effort. Interested parties must demonstrate in their SOC they have the capability to provide the systems and services to fulfill the Government's immediate, short-term need for the projects described above. Interested parties must also demonstrate how an alternative approach can be cost competitive with the long term sustainment plans described above. The SOC shall not exceed 20 pages. The Government will use this SOC to determine if there is sufficient interest in the marketplace from qualified sources to attempt full and open competition.</p>
<p>This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay any costs associated with the submittal of information solicited herein. The SOC and all related communications that contain proprietary information should be marked as such. Verbal responses will not be accepted. Responses from small business and small disadvantaged business firms with the capability and capacity to perform this requirement are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.</p>
<p>The notice expires 15 working days after publication.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this effort is 541712 and the Small Business Size Standard is 1000 employees. Capabilities information may be emailed to Ms. Sara E. Lawlyes, Contracting Officer, at Sara.Lawlyes@losangeles.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>Battery Life Test Appliance<BR><BR>This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This is a request for information.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.<BR><BR>The purpose of the proposed acquisition is to identify qualified organizations that can provide a solution that will verify the operational battery life of hand-held, push-to-talk (PTT), radio interface assemblies.  Typically these systems are referred to as headset/radio PTTs and may come with an internal battery, which cannot be readily verified for true battery life.  In an effort to ensure that the operational battery life is accurate, we are pursuing all available options to actively test the PTTs, as opposed to relying on mathematical calculations or modeling.  Product specification sheets, White Papers and / or other relative information are welcomed as we conduct a review of each and an overall Analysis of Alternatives.  The testing is necessary to verify operational thresholds, mainly duration, of battery powered, human actuated communications equipment in order to both verify manufacturers stated performance specifications and to be better able to mission plan on known equipment battery life cycles. <BR>Desired Capabilities: <BR>1.  The device shall be able to test at least one Device Under Test (DUT) at a time (T). Device may be able to test up to 5 devices simultaneously (O).<BR>2.  The device should be able to test multiple DUTs over time with little if any failure; an acceptable Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) has not yet been determined.<BR>3.  The device shall be adaptable to system being tested (test duration, frequency, etc) and not specific to a single DUT type.<BR>4.  The device should be a mechanical apparatus versus human interface/interaction to provide the actuation specific to the DUT.<BR>5.  The device shall include or incorporate a device under test voltage / amperage draw monitor.<BR>6.  The device shall include or incorporate a device under test voltage / amperage remaining (battery life) indicator.<BR>7.  The device shall include or incorporate a data logging function (could be part of monitoring system) which can be queried at any point during or after the test in order to observe voltage / amperage (battery power) remaining of the DUT. <BR>8.  The resulting data shall be exportable as a compatible data file which is readable in and printable via Microsoft Windows (XP SP2) or higher.  <BR>9.  The device may include or incorporate a print function which provides or facilitates printing directly to a printer or via Microsoft Windows (XP SP2) or higher.  <BR>10.  The devices results output shall be able to be monitored locally (T). The device may be monitored remotely (O).<BR>11.  Vendor submissions must perform consistently on standard and non-standard Special Operations Forces communications equipment where a physical force (commonly the operators finger) is required to operate / activate the device (ex. communications headset system Push-to-Talk (PTT) switch).<BR>12.  The device shall be programmable to allow for the testing of different types, functionalities and form factors of communications equipment.<BR>13.  The system should take into account the need to periodically be tested and/or calibrated and the vendor shall provide their service and customer support plan. <BR>14.  The system may be portable in that it could be operated with either commercial AC power or by battery.<BR>15.

<DESC>National Industries for the Blind (NIB), a designated central nonprofit agency of The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, is pursuing potential partnerships with U.S. commercial manufacturers of Business Sized and High Security Shredders for the purpose of providing employment for people who are blind or severely disabled. If successful, the result will be a co-brand agreement between the manufacturer and the AbilityOne Program, and its registered brands. The ultimate expectation is that the co-branded product will be placed on the Committee's Procurement List (PL).
<p>The Business Sized and High Security Shredders must meet and/or exceed FAR and other Federal Government published standards, Executive Orders and Federal Agency requirements.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the following criteria must be met:</p>
<p>1. Possession of a nationally known brand name that can be demonstrated to have significant appeal through evidence of substantial sales.<br />2. The Business Sized Paper Shredders must have equal to or better than performance standards as currently supplied under the following National Stock Numbered items:<br />7490-01-483-8984<br />7490-01-483-8985<br />7490-01-483-8990<br />7490-01-483-8991<br />7490-01-567-4337<br />7490-01-567-4338<br />7490-01-567-4338<br />The successful partner will be encouraged to expand model offerings to satisfy a majority of the business size paper shredder market.<br />3. The High Security Paper Shredders described must meet the NSA/CSS Standards 02-01 for final destruction of paper documents, and meet and/or exceed the FAR and other published Federal standards, including Executive Orders and applicable agency-unique requirements. The successful partner must offer a line of high security shredding machines to include at least 5 models. Initial development is for a medium duty and heavy duty, high security shredder in both a console office configuration and a hand carried deployable field use configuration. Additionally, a successful partner must provide a heavy duty high security shredder with an auto oiler in the console version.<br />4. The chosen manufacturer must be willing to set a high priority for delivering bulk materials to the non-profit agency in order to assure the agency of on-time deliveries to the federal government customer(s).<br />5. All products must be manufactured and lab tested, certified and customer tested to be effective according to their purpose, have current Material Safety Data sheets, if necessary, and meet certifications with corresponding documentation designated by customers.<br />6. A willingness to enter into a multi-year agreement which includes on-going technical and production assistance and the necessary factory trained technical field support while enabling the non-profit agency to meet the criteria of the AbilityOne Program to convert material, label, assemble and package the products thereby creating employment for people who are blind or severely disabled.<br />7. Commitment to working independently with the AbilityOne to market products to the Government customers under the AbilityOne Program. It is preferred that the chosen manufacturer has a dedicated team for Federal Government sales and marketing.<br />8. Willingness to work with the non-profit agency, (NIB or NISH) and the Committee to ensure that the price to the end-users is a fair and reasonable price.<br />9. Manufacturers' submissions must demonstrate that proposed products meet the various criteria, as well as indicate what functions the nonprofit agency's employees would perform. Submissions should recommend ways to maximize the employment for people who are bind or severely disabled in the fulfillment of the products.</p>

<DESC><p>The mission of the Air Force Office of the Civil Engineer (AF/A7C) is to provide, operate, maintain, and protect sustainable installations as weapon systems platforms through engineering and emergency response services across the full mission spectrum. This is a daunting mission for our organization which, in recent years, has seen significant reductions in budget and personnel with no associated reduction in our physical plant profile. Today AF/A7C supports approximately 166 installations worldwide that account for over 700 million square feet of facilities, more than 500 miles of runways, and some 10 million acres of land managed by approximately 66,000 civil engineers, and an annual budget exceeding $14B.<br /><br />The Civil Engineer (CE) organization cannot achieve its mission with its current information management systems. To operate more effectively and efficiently, AF/A7C is seeking to lend greater transparency and accuracy to our decision-making and resource allocation processes. The expected outcome will be more robust, accurate, and transparent information management capabilities to produce the most effective and strategic resource allocation decisions. To manage this transformation, AF/A7C established an Information Technology (IT) Program Management Office (PMO), located in Arlington, Virginia. The IT PMO resides within the AF/A7C Resources Division for IT (AF/A7CRT). This division is led by the AF/A7C Chief Information Officer (CIO) that has overall responsibility for managing the implementation, sustainment, and day-to-day operations for all information management investments across the enterprise.<br /><br />This solicitation presents the requirements to replace legacy software for several existing AF/A7C core capabilities with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) IT software solution. After selection of the COTS software solution, an independently selected service provider will partner with the COTS software vendor to implement and maintain the solution in a Defense Information System Agency (DISA) environment.</p>

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is soliciting abstracts (White Papers) for Energy Conservation Applications for the U.S. Navy. This BAA solicits innovative concepts from industry and academia that can introduce applications for Navy shipboard energy conservation and carbon footprint reduction with the potential for rapid transition to Fleet operation.  The target segment of the Fleet is the ships operated by Military Sealift Command: Combat Logistics Force, Auxiliaries and Sealift.  The Navy will consider approaches that modify systems and/or operations to affect quantifiable energy conservation and carbon footprint reduction in the Fleet.
  Technology maturity should, at a minimum, have basic technological components integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements and be capable of demonstrating prototype operation in a relevant environment by the conclusion of Phase II.  Emphasis is placed on technologies with an identified transition path capable of making near-term, measurable improvements to Navy energy conservation and carbon footprint reduction.  Solutions of all levels of development will be considered, ranging from near-term strategies applicable to existing ship classes to those suitable for new construction and future design. Technology maturity, however, will be a criteria of evaluation considered with preference shown for solutions with more immediate impact.
  The white paper submitted under the concept phase shall be limited to 5 (five) pages.  Responses to this BAA shall include (1) a brief description of the basic approach the offerer intends to pursue, a concept of operations for the proposed systems or technologies, and any prior work that will contribute to the success of the effort, (2) a description of the technology maturity of the approach with focus on the development and projected implementation times; (3) the benefits anticipated should the concept be implemented (e.g., cost savings, environmental impacts, operational or capability improvements); (4) a cost estimate for Phase 1: Conceptual Design and Phase 2: Detailed Design, Prototype Development and Demonstration; (5) corporate/personnel experience and ability to successfully perform this effort ; (6) past performance information on similar projects; (7) the offerers awareness of the state of the art and technical understanding of the scope of the requirement, including any problem areas; (8) facilities available for fabrication and fabrication approach.
  This BAA will be open for two years and white papers may be submitted any time throughout the two year period beginning 1 November 2010 and ending 31 October 2012.  White papers will be reviewed and evaluated on a periodic basis.  Additional information, including specific focus areas of interest to the Navy, will be provided periodically through the following website at:  http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/carderock/pub/business/baa.aspx.  All white papers shall be submitted to the NSWCCD electronically, by following the directions at the above website.  White papers shall be clearly marked with the BAA number N00167-11-BAA-01.  Proprietary material shall be prominently marked as such.  The selection of one or more sources for full proposals and potential contract award will be based on responses to the BAA and peer review process.
  The type of award anticipated for the Phase I Conceptual Design is Firm Fixed Price.  Contract types for follow-on phases shall be determined on a case basis.  The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal costs for responses submitted.  Offerors are advised that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government to contract.  All work under this BAA shall be unclassified.  Technical questions in reference to this BAA should be directed to Mr. Jamie Mattern at james.g.mattern1@navy.mil or 301-227-0769.

<DESC>Government Sources Sought Request for Information (RFI) for Expeditionary Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Neutralization System (EUNS).

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS  

Description: The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) under the sponsorship of the Program Executive Office for Littoral and Mine Warfare (PMS-408) is requesting information on small (two-person portable) unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) mine neutralization systems as part of an Analysis of Alternatives study. This study will focus on analyses of alternative systems to perform mine neutralization in three distinct mission areas: (1) A low observable system for use in non-permissive environments in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) zone with water depths from 10-60 feet to support the Concept of Operations (CONOP) to reduce the MCM tactical timeline.
 (2) A system which can operate in permissive environments in water depths from 60-300 feet in near shore areas including open areas of harbors and shipping channels. (3) A variant system which can operate in permissive environments in confined environments (e.g., harbors or ship channels) where neutralization with low resultant collateral damage is required due to proximity to critical infrastructure. Systems 2 and 3 will normally operate in support of the concept to reduce operator risk as described below.  Although intended to be employed in permissive environments, standoff between topside operators and subsystems, and in-water subsystems is required for employment in expeditionary operations where shore side and waterside activities may not always be under control of friendly forces.
  These systems will utilize known target information (location, depth, target type) acquired by precursor systems.  The current baseline comparative system employed by EOD Expeditionary Forces consists of EOD divers delivering a countercharge within neutralization range of the target.  

Any proposed platform (system) must possess the potential for addition of sensors, payloads, and command and control algorithms for future development efforts.  Notional Concepts for these systems include:

CONCEPT 1  Reduce risk to the operator by employing a robust, highly autonomous Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle (AUV), or a combination Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)-ROV solution capable of precision delivery, placement and aiming (if required) of neutralizers on previously localized, in-volume and bottom targets (including buried) for follow-on actuation.

CONCEPT 2  Reduce the tactical timeline in non-permissive pre-assault amphibious MCM environments, and rapid follow on MCM clearance environments by employing an expendable AUV neutralizer capable of autonomously reacquiring previously localized in-volume and bottom targets, and either automatically actuating upon arrival at the effective target location, or positioning itself in a manner that will enable effective mine neutralization upon directed actuation.

Responses to this market survey are due on or before 30 days from release of this RFI.
  Any proposed technically mature system must include a product description with current verified performance characteristics and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements, summary of current use by other military/operational forces, and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units.  Test data and/or analytical predictions of systems ability to station keep on or near the target is desired.  Information on suitability of systems used by U.S. Navy, including: existing test data or reports and certifications as to whether energetic payloads qualify as insensitive munitions; and compliance with MIL-STD-882D systems safety requirements is also desired.
  Of particular interest are those systems which are sufficiently small and robust such that they can be easily assembled and launched by one or two persons from small inflatable boats in remote areas without the need for cranes, davits or other handling aids to support use in expeditionary operations.  

Any proposed system or concepts still under development should include an assessment of the current Technology Readiness Level (TRL), descriptions of risk areas and mitigation plans to achieve TRL 9, development schedule and estimated development and unit cost for test articles and future production units.  Please provide name of firm, address, POC, phone/fax number, and email address.   Telephone responses will not be honored.
 This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for bid or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No further information is available from the contracting office.

Technical Questions and responses to this RFI should be directed to Paul Moser, e-mail: paul.moser@navy.mil, address: Paul Moser, Code E15, Naval Surface Warfare Panama City Division, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL  32407. Please send a copy of the response to this RFI to Mr. Phil Montgomery, e-mail: phillip.r.montgomery@navy.mil, address: Phil Montgomery, PMS-408 (EOD) MCM UUV Projects Manager , 2008 Stump Neck Rd., Indian Head, MD 20640 and to Stuart Burman, Contract Specialist, stuart.burman@navy.mil NSWC PCD Code B32.
  

In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned  a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the solicitation will be publicized and any subsequent award made in the Navy Seaport-E portal. This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.

<DESC>&nbsp; THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This is not a request for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this notice. There will not be a solicitation, specifications, or drawings available at this time. The intent of this notice is to identify potential offerors for the following upcoming requirement:
<p>Approximately 110,000 cubic yards of concrete are required in the JFP Control Structure construction at Folsom Dam, in Folsom, CA. This concrete will be supplied by an onsite batch plant and transferred to the placement site by belts, cranes, and buckets. The Government will prepare mix designs for all of the mass concrete as indicated on the drawings. Most will contain 3-inch nominal maximum size (NMS) coarse aggregate with 1-1/2 and 3/4 inch aggregate being used to accommodate rebar spacing in certain areas. Mass concrete placements will vary in size from approximately 350 to 2,400 cubic yards (based on the current placement plan); therefore, second and third shifts with around-the-clock sampling and testing will be necessary at times. The number of samples and the times at which samples will be taken will be as directed. The primary purpose of the Quality Assurance Contractor is to sample and test materials and report such findings to the Government.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to have a home lab that is accredited by AASHTO for compliance with ASTM E 329, ASTM C 1077, and ASTM D 3740. It shall also be validated by abbreviated audit by the Corp of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center(ERDC). In addition, the Contractor's home lab shall be located no more than a two hour drive from the project site. At a minimum, two qualified technicians will be present on site full time, at the JFP site in Folsom, California, with up to a total of eight technicians to handle peak production rates. All technicians and lab personnel shall be ACI Level I certified or an equivalent agency certification with at least two years experience. In addition, due to the location of the project site, all personnel will undergo a Security background check. A resume of each technician will be required which contains the technician's certification number and relevant experience. The Contractor is required to provide an onsite lab. The Contractor will be provided with a concrete slab floor building with windows and doors, electricity, air conditioning, heat and water on the jobsite. The Contractor must supply their own lab equipment, office furnishings, computer equipment, and so forth to perform the required tests. Some modifications to the structure should be anticipated in order to incorporate the Contractor's specific equipment. Once the onsite lab has been set up, it will be required to become ERDC validated. Sampling and testing of concrete shall be in conformance with the requirements indicated in Attachment 1. It should be noted that the majority of concrete for the planned work will include 3-inch NMS aggregates and, therefore, specimens will be prepared with both 6x12-inch and minimum 9x18-inch compressive strength specimen molds (provided by the Contractor).</p>

<DESC>Furnish one factory-assembled, induced draft, crossflow cooling tower with vertical air discharge, conforming to the following specifications.  The cooling tower design should be based on a Baltimore Aircoil Company Model 31132C-MM. Other manufacturer?s equipment will be considered in accordance with these specifications.
Thermal Capacity: The cooling tower(s) shall be warranted by the manufacturer to cool 1000 US GPM of water from 90 ?F to 70 ?F at the average summer-time conditions at the proposed location.  The location for the unit will be 8 miles south of Midwest, Wyoming.  The average wind and snow loads for the area shall be considered in the design according to ASCE standards.  The area of usage is in an oil field in a low seismic risk area. 
Corrosion Resistant Construction: Unless otherwise noted in this specification, all steel basin panels and structural members shall be constructed of heavy-gauge G-235 (Z700 metric) hot-dip galvanized steel with all edges given a protective coating of zincrich compound.
The cooling tower shall be constructed with a sturdy structural frame designed to transmit all wind, seismic and mechanical loads to the equipment anchorage. The frame shall be constructed of heavy-gauge steel angles and channels.  Panels can be  corrosion and UV-resistant fiberglass reinforced polyester (FRP) to minimize maintenance requirements and prolong equipment life.  Type 304 stainless steel casing panels may be used in lieu of FRP panels.
All water basins shall be constructed of heavy-gauge steel or hot-dip galvanized steel panels as required and structural members. The basins must be accessible from outside the unit and serviceable during tower operation.  Basin shall include a depressed center section with drain/clean-out connection. The basin area under the fill shall be sloped toward the depressed center section to facilitate cleaning. The basin volume shall be adequate to prevent starving the pump.
The cooling tower cold water basin shall be provided with electric heater(s) to prevent freezing in low ambient conditions. The heater(s) shall be selected to maintain 40?F (4.44?C) basin water temperatures at -20?F (?C) ambient.  The heater(s) shall be 480 V/ 3 phase/ 60 Hz electric and shall be provided with low water cutout and thermostat.  A hot water coil shall be factory installed in the depressed section of the cold water basin to prevent freezing during cold water shutdown. The steam coil shall be capable of maintaining 40?F (4.44?C) basin water temperature at a -20?F (-28.89?C) ambient temperature given 90?F water temperature at the coil inletconnection.  All basins will be fitted with drain valves for complete draining during extended cold-weather shut down.
The tower shall be furnished with a single water inlet connection complete with the means to automatically balance flow rates to the hot water basins.
The fan shall be heavy-duty, axial flow with aluminum alloy blades selected to provide optimum cooling tower thermal performance with minimal sound levels.  Air shall discharge through a fan cylinder designed for streamlined air entry and minimum tip clearance for maximum fan efficiency. The top of the fan cylinder shall be equipped with a conical, non-sagging removable fan guard.  Fan(s) and shaft(s) shall be supported by heavy-duty, self-aligning, greasepackedball bearings with moisture proof seals and integral slinger collars.  Fan and motor sheave(s) shall be fabricated from corrosion-resistant materials to minimize maintenance and ensure maximum drive and powerband operating life.
Fan motor(s) shall be no larger than 30 hp with 20 hp preferred and 240/480 V 3-phase.  Fan motor(s) shall be totally enclosed air over (TEAO), reversible, squirrel cage, ball bearing type designed specifically for cooling tower service. The motor shall be furnished with special moisture protection on windings, shafts and bearings and labeled appropriately for cooling tower duty. Fan motors shall be inverter duty type designed per NEMA Standard MG1, Section IV, Part 31.
To maintain the quality of the local environment, the sound pressure levels (dB) from the cooling tower operating at design point fan speed shall not exceed the sound levels for 8-hour exposure. 
Safety and other shut down features common to cooling towers shall be included for safe operation of the system.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this Internet address http://acquisition.gov/far/index.html <br />(End of provision)<br />52.202-1 Definitions (Jul 2004) <br />52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are _ are not _ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have _ have not _, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are _ are not _ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have _, have not _, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has _ has not _, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision) <br />52.209-8 Updates of Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) <br />(a) The Contractor shall update the information in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) on a semi-annual basis, throughout the life of the contract, by entering the required information in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). <br />(b)(1) The Contractor will receive notification when the Government posts new information to the Contractor's record. <br />(2) The Contractor will have an opportunity to post comments regarding information that has been posted by the Government. The comments will be retained as long as the associated information is retained, i.e., for a total period of 6 years. Contractor comments will remain a part of the record unless the Contractor revises them. <br />(3) With the exception of the Contractor, only Government personnel and authorized users performing business on behalf of the Government will be able to view the Contractor's record in the system. Public requests for system information will be handled under Freedom of Information Act procedures, including, where appropriate, procedures promulgated under E.O. 12600.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.

The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph.

The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected.

Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>(xv) 52.246-16 Responsibility for Supplies (Apr 1984)<br />(a) Title to supplies furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon formal acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession, unless the contract specifically provides for earlier passage of title.<br />(b) Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss of or damage to supplies shall remain with the Contractor until, and shall pass to the Government upon --<br />(1) Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is f.o.b. origin; or<br />(2) Acceptance by the Government or delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract, whichever is later, if transportation is f.o.b. destination.<br />(c) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply to supplies that so fail to conform to contract requirements as to give a right of rejection.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Support Relief Group (SRG) - Hydrometeorological Hazard Advisor</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: GS-14 equivalent ($84,697 - $110,104) - not eligible for locality pay. Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history and educational background.

<p>6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year, with four one-year options</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as part of the Support Relief Group (SRG). It is the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)'s intent to contract for these services for a maximum of 250 days per calendar year.</p>
<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Date contractor is needed to report to DCHA/OFDA or assignment in the field<br />2. Duration of Assignment<br />3. Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify DCHA/OFDA within 24 hours of availability. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a disaster may require the assignment to be extended (not to exceed 250 days). The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include but is not limited to Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity. In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field. The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time intermittent basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations. SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>Activation of the Hydrometerological Hazard Advisor will be coordinated with OFDA/TAG. USAID/OFDA activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Hydrometeorological Hazard Advisor to provide expert technical advice and assistance for the analysis of hazard potential and risks to populations. This person will also be expected to provide expert advice on disaster response and risk reduction strategies for hydrometeorological disasters world-wide such as floods, droughts, tsunamis, wind storms, climate variability and change, dam breaks, and other climate-, weather- and water-induced hazards.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Hydrometeorological Hazard Advisor's responsibilities will include the following:</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Support Relief Group (SRG) - Nutrition Advisor</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: GS-14 equivalent ($84,697 - $110,104 - not eligible for locality pay). Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history and educational background.

<p>6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year, with four one-year options</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as part of the Support Relief Group (SRG). It is the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)'s intent to contract for these services for a maximum of 250 days per calendar year.</p>
<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Date contractor is needed to report to DCHA/OFDA or assignment in the field<br />2. Duration of Assignment<br />3. Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify DCHA/OFDA within 24 hours of availability. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a disaster may require the assignment to be extended (not to exceed 250 days). The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include but is not limited to Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity. In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field. The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations. SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>Activation of the Nutrition Advisor will be coordinated with OFDA/TAG. USAID/OFDA activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Nutrition Advisor to provide expert technical advice and assistance for the analysis of potential nutrition risks to populations. This person will also be expected to provide expert advice on disaster response and risk reduction strategies for nutrition activities worldwide.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as part of the Support Relief Group (SRG). It is the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)'s intent to contract for these services for a maximum of 250 days per calendar year.</p>
<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Date contractor is needed to report to DCHA/OFDA or assignment in the field<br />2. Duration of Assignment<br />3. Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify DCHA/OFDA within 24 hours of availability. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a disaster may require the assignment to be extended (not to exceed 250 days). The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include but is not limited to Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity. In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field. The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations. SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>Activation of the Public Health Advisor will be coordinated with OFDA/TAG. USAID/OFDA activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Public Health Advisor to provide expert technical advice and assistance for the analysis of public health risks and/or potential public health risks to populations.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<CONTACT>John Inman, Contract Specialist, Phone 907-228-6231, Fax 907-228-6254, Email jinman@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The Forest Service contemplates releasing a solicitation on or about Oct. 28, 2010, for the Spit Point Stewardship project. This acquisition is under the authority of Section 347 of Public Law 105-277 to achieve land management objectives while meeting local community needs. In this acquisition, a combination of appropriated dollars and forest products will be used to obtain land management activities from a contractor. About 520 MBF of merchantable timber (a combination of spruce, hemlock, and alder) is available in three stands near Spit Point, in Carroll Inlet on Revillagigedo Island, near Ketchikan, Alaska. These stands are in the beach buffer, where previous clearcuts have resulted in dense conifer regeneration, elimination of the forage understory, and reduction in structural diversity. Two of the stands are 17 acres in size; one is 12 acres. In these three stands, the contractor will improve the wildlife habitat by removing biomass material and treating remaining slash. There are no roads connecting the project area to Ketchikan, and there are no roads connecting Ketchikan (or Revillagigedo Island) to the North American continent.
<p>The contemplated schedule includes solicitation release on or about Oct. 28, 2010, a pre-proposal conference in Ketchikan is scheduled to be&nbsp;on&nbsp;Nov. 22, 2010, and proposals due on Dec. 6, 2010. The solicitation&nbsp;is now&nbsp;available from this FedBizOpps website. A prospective offeror should visit this FedBizOpps website from time to time to stay up-to-date on this acquisition. A request for proposals (RFP) is contemplated. A set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns is contemplated. NAICS Code 113110, Classification Code F, and Product/Service Code F006 are contemplated.&nbsp;The anticipated award date is before Dec. 31, 2010.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.</p>

<DESC><p>Pre-Solicitation Notice - Repairs to the USCG Cargo Wharf in Kodiak Alaska. The project consists of strengthening the Wharf in the splash zone, intertidal, and below extreme low tide by the addition of structural bracing and the installation of replacement water and sewer lines with redundant heat trace installed inside insulation and a protective jacket. The water and sewer lines will be moved to a more protected location beneath the wharf and supported from the pilings and pile caps. The work will be accomplished on a wharf in active use which will require day to day coordination with the CG. The heat trace system includes a monitoring and alarm system for heat trace failure. The water and sewer lines will require a coordinated installation/transition to minimize interruptions to services to the dock. See the solicitation for bonding requirements. The estimated price range for the base year is between $ 5,000,000 and $10,000,000. This procurement is issued as a 100% small business set-aside. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 and the applicable size standard is $33.5 million dollars in annual receipts for the past three years. All responsible small businesses may submit a bid. This solicitation will not be issued in paper form. Solicitation documents may be accessed for download from the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website beginning on the date of issue (estimated to be on or about 16 Nov 2010) at the following site: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Any amendments issued to the solicitation will be posted on this website. Prospective Bidders are responsible for checking the website for amendments up to the date and time bids are due. Firms must be currently registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for award of a contract. A planholders list will not be available for this project from CEU-Juneau.

<a href="mailto:elizabeth.dean2@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>On November 2, 2009, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center posted Pre-Solicitation Notice VA118-10-RI-0045 announcing the process and requesting industry participation in the Department's initiative related to VA's 13 Greatest Challenges. IAW FAR 15.202, the Government issued the pre-solicitation notice in order to establish strategic partnerships with industry to conquer the challenges faced by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as it transforms into a high-performing organization that is better aligned with 21st century Veterans and our responsibilities to deliver our Veterans the best possible support and services. As specified in the original notice, the period for submission of concepts described below was open for a period of 1 year up to November 2, 2010. Please be advised this amendment to the original notice specifies that the Government is not extending the period for submission of concept papers under the current competitive process described below and at VA Supplier Relationship Transformation website at http://www1.va.gov/oamm/transformation/index.cfm. Concept paper submissions must be received at the VA Virtual Office of Acquisition (VOA) web site at https://www.voa.va.gov/ by 11:59PM on November 2, 2010 in order to be considered. For those unfamiliar with the current process, the following provides the applicable details as included in the original notice. Details regarding any subsequent process and information regarding opportunities to address VA's Greatest Challenges will be combined with the VA Innovation Initiative (VAi2) program and will be addressed under a separate Pre-solicitation Notice. 



The following 13 Greatest Challenges identified by the Department were included in the original Pre-solicitation Notice:



1. Eliminate Veteran Homelessness

2. Enable 21st Century Benefits Delivery and Services (e.g. backlog reduction)

3. Automate GI Bill Benefits

4. Implement Virtual Lifetime Electronic Records (VLER)

5. Improve Veterans Mental Health

6. Build Veterans Relationship Management (VRM) Capability to Enable Convenient, Seamless Interactions

7. Design a Veteran-Centric Healthcare Model and Right-Sized Infrastructure to Help Veterans Navigate the Healthcare Delivery System and Receive Coordinated Care

8. Expand Healthcare Access for Veterans, Including Women and Rural Populations

9. Ensure Preparedness to Meet Emergent National Needs (e.g. hurricanes, H1N1 virus)

10. Develop Capabilities and Enabling Systems to Drive Performance and Outcomes 

11. Establish Strong VA Management Infrastructure and Integrated Operating Model

12. Transform Human Capital Management

13. Perform Research and Development to Enhance the Long-Term Health and Well-Being of Veterans



Each challenge is described in greater detail on the following web site: http://www.va.gov/oamm/transformation/ for more information on the VA's strategy to conquer these challenges, see the VA's Strategic Plan at http://www1.va.gov/op3/docs/VA_2006_2011_Strategic_Plan.pdf. For more information on the budget resources planned to support these initiatives, see the FY 2010 budget highlights at http://www4.va.gov/budget/summary/2010/Fast_Facts_VA_Budget_Highlights.pdf .



Industry can submit their ideas as a "concept paper" as a short, three to five page document describing the proposed solution. The concept papers must present solutions to systemic challenges, not technologies or approaches that address a narrow problem. The concept papers shall be submitted electronically to the VA Virtual Office of Acquisition web portal at https://www.voa.va.gov/. Subject matter experts from the VA and technical support staff from the Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research (MITRE) Corporation will conduct initial evaluations to determine which ideas/concepts have viability for further consideration. Contractors who submit concept papers that warrant further consideration will be notified by e-mail and requested to provide additional technical information through an oral presentation, inclusive of briefing slides, and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate to support the proposed solution. The Government reserves the right to utilize any information provided by industry via concept papers and any subsequent technical proposals, ROM cost estimate and oral presentations for purposes of future competitive acquisitions. Concept papers that are not recommended for further consideration will be archived and the contractor will be notified in writing that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor on any subsequent acquisition. Bid and proposal costs will not be reimbursed by the Government.



In addition to the challenges identified herein, industry is also encouraged to submit ideas for the improvement of VA processes not specifically identified above. These proposals shall be submitted to the website at https://www.voa.va.gov/ as Unsolicited Proposals and conform to the submission requirements and be evaluated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.6.

VA Palo Alto Health Care System
3801 Miranda Avenue
Palo Alto, California 94304

Subject:  Sole Source Procurement - MRI Scanner Repair for VA Palo Alto Health Care System; RFP VA-261-11-RP-0971

1.  CONTRACTING AGENCY:  Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 21 Consolidated Contracting Activity (CCA) is responsible for the contracting action as described herein and will enter into a contract that requires justification for other than full and open competition.  The solicitation number is VA-261-11-RP-0971.

2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  The request is being procured exclusive of competition, for a specific vendor, on a sole source basis.  The award has been made to General Electric Company, DBA GE, 3000 N. Grandview Blvd W-443, Waukesha, WI 53188 as a firm fixed price contract. 

3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: Summary of Requirements: Contractor will troubleshoot, repair and replace defective components for the GE 1.5 T MRI Scanner located at VA Palo Alto. 

Estimated value of VISN 21 requirement is $35,000.00.  

4. AUTHORITY CITED:  FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and compelling urgency. 
 
5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED: The service is being procured pursuant to FAR 6.302-2, to perform an emergency weekend repair of the MRI Scanner to preclude a negative impact on patient care.  General Electric Company has the necessary proprietary diagnostic software capabilities and expertise to quickly diagnose and restore the unit to its full diagnostic imaging capacity.

6. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  Competition was not considered due to the urgent need to have the scanner operational to avoid any interruptions and scheduling delays with veterans' services.  It was determined to be in the Government's best interest to make an award to General Electric Company.

7.  FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION:  A Price Negotiation Memorandum (PNM) will detail how the price was determined to be fair and reasonable.

8.  MARKET SURVEY/RESEARCH:  GE Healthcare is the manufacturer of the MRI Scanner and has the technical expertise, experience and capabilities to promptly diagnose and repair the equipment.  

9.  OTHER FACTORS:  This requirement will be awarded to a large business and will be accompanied by VA Form 2268 for Small Business Review.  

10.  INTERESTED SOURCES:  The contracting officer has made a determination to issue a sole source award to General Electric Company. 

11.  AGENCY ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:  Due to the circumstances described in #6 and #9, no competition will apply to this action.

12.  CONTRACTING OFFICERS CERTIFICATION:  I hereby determine that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in the J&A are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
