<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Jean M. Cahill, 2629 Mill Race Road, Frederick Md. 21701 for a modification to purchase order 263-MD-515648 for an additional 690 hours of services being provided to the National Institutes of General Medicine Sciences Grants Administration Branch.  Jean M. Cahill is the only known source capable of providing the required services because of her involvement in this project over the past months. Further, inherent duplication of cost to the Government’s requirement would be time and cost prohibiting.  The Government’s requirement consists of two projects whole Genome Association (WGA) and Biomarkers for the diagnosis treatment and cure of disease.  The contractor is responsible for providing assistance in developing new procedural guidance and updating existing documents necessary for the clean-up of systems backlogs; assist grants management specialists with the support  of  the Division of Pharmacology Physiology and Biological Chemistry; maintain and update checklists, award footnotes and other resources; and assist the Grants and council Operations staff with the updating of overdue records related to unfunded applications, national Research Service Award termination notices and grants close-out.  It is believed that Jean M. Cahill is the only source that can provide the above services because of her working knowledge of the HHS/NIH regulations and policies governing grants administration, her expertise with regard to the  small business Innovation Research and the small business technology transfer grants mechanisms such that  she can  provide assistance and preparing grants awards, and her ability to utilize the NIH  IMPAC II Grants managements module.  In addition, the contractor must  process the skills to communicate effectively and efficiently in writing and orally to create procedural guidance and  other documentation, to analyze complex cases and recommend viable solutions  and the ability to use a personal computer.   This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, all quotations received within ten days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition requirement based upon responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition

<DESC>The Air to ground Munitions Systems Wing (A-GMSW), A-G DASG Fuzes Program Office, is contemplating issuing a Sole Source Award to Kaman Dayron in Orlando FL.  This effort is to procure an additional 31,606 FMU-152A/B Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) systems along with additional spare parts components and 180 fuze trainers over the years FY06 through FY11.  The current contract awarded to Kaman-Dayron specifies maximum quantities allowable in priced production options.  The current FMU-152A/B acquisition strategy is to buy-to-budget to catch up with JDAM total production quantities.  This contract modification is meant to increase maximum allowable quantities under each of the remaining production options with the first additional quantities delivered with the production option starting in October 2006.  The estimated cost of this additional procurement is approximately $65M.  The FMU-152A/B JPF is a cockpit-selectable bomb fuze employed in MK-80 series warheads (both guided and unguided variations), and both the 2000lb and 5000lb series Penetrator warheads.  The FMU-152A/B fuze system consists of the fuze, the FZU-55A/B fuze initiator, a closure ring, and power cable.  Spares for the fuze system would consist of the FZU-55A/B initiator, power cable, closure ring, compatibility hardware for GBU-15/AGM-130 configuration, and a small variety of sub-tier components.  In addition to the required spares, the government requires additional procurement of JPF trainers in the following configurations: 1.  The FMU-152A(D-1)/B configuration consists of  a non-explosive fuze with working electronics and the closure ring used for laboratory and pilot familiarization and proficiency training and 2. The FMU-152A(D-2)/B configuration consists of the FZU-55 initiator, power cable, closure ring, compatibility hardware for GBU-15/AGM-130 configuration, and shipping plug, and used for load crew standardization and weapon assembly familiarization training.   The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  Interested parties must produce or procure for delivery qualified fuzes, spare parts, and trainers and may submit statements of capability (SOC) or capabilities package addressing the following:  (1) Demonstrated technical knowledge of the Joint Programmable Fuze (FMU-152A/B) requirements for operational performance, interface requirements for JDAM and other guided munitions/general purpose bombs, interface requirements for required US and Allied aircraft, and system safety requirements; (2) Adequate production facilities and production capabilities to produce and assemble the fuze (FMU-152A/B) and closure ring as listed above, and produce or acquire associated sub-tier components; (3) Adequate production facilities and production capabilities to produce and assemble the fuze initiator (FZU-55A/B) and power cable, and produce or acquire associated sub-tier components; (4) Adequate production facilities and production capabilities to produce and assemble fuze trainers as listed above; (5) Ability to perform acceptance and other required tests of fuzes and fuze initiators in accordance with Contractor developed and Government approved plans; (6) Ability to deliver fuzes, fuze initiators, spares, and trainers on schedule.  Responders to this synopsis will not be provided the results of the government evaluation of their qualifying package.  Responses to this synopsis should be submitted for receipt by the Government within 45 days of the publication date and must state whether the potential source is a small business concern IAW FAR 52.219-1.  The NAIC Code/Size Standards is 332995/500 employees.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Interested sources should contact Julia Woodard, Contract Specialist, 850-882-8787 ext 2149, FAX (850) 882-1003 or MS Joanie Collins, Contracting Officer, 850-882-8787 ext 3109, FAX (850) 882-1003.

The areas of consideration will include, but not be limited to, Navy, Marine Corps, and miscellaneous Federal and other facilities.  Task orders will be issued for the work that will require design and construction services.  In support of design-build work, the Contractor shall employ the services of an architect/engineering professional experienced in the coordination of multi-disciplined architectural/engineering design efforts in all aspects of general building and new and renovation projects.  The scope of work will not include the more highly specialized waterfront projects.  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220 and the annual size standard is $28.5 million.  Estimated price range is more than $10,000,000.  

The proposed contract is limited to qualifying 8(a) firms in the Honolulu District Office (HDO) of the Small Business Administration.  The Government will not consider offers from other than 8(a) firms or from 8(a) firms outside of the Honolulu District.  8(a) firms that are not serviced by the HDO, but have a bona fide place of business (as defined by SBA) within the geographic area served by the HDO are also eligible to submit offers.  An 8(a) firm not serviced by the HDO must consult its servicing District Office regarding the establishment of a bona fide place of business or status of a previously established bona fide place of business.  All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers.  

This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent of awarding a maximum of five (5) firm fixed-price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the procurement if only one proposal is received that offers the best value to the Government.  

The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures, which require offerors to submit a technical and price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  The technical factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than price.  Technical evaluation factors A, B and C are considered of equal importance and more important than Factor D.  The subfactors under technical factors A and B are listed in descending order of importance.  The subfactors under technical factor D are considered of equal importance.  The Government will require pricing of a sample project for the price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the following technical factors:  FACTOR A:  Past Performance of the Offeror and Design Teams; FACTOR B:  Qualifications and Experience of the Offeror, Design Team, Quality Control Manager and Site Safety and Health Officer; FACTOR C:  Management Plan; and FACTOR D:  Work Plans and Schedule for the sample project.  The contract term will be a base period of one year plus four option years.  The Government will award a minimum guarantee of $5,000 for each contract for the base year only.  The total value of all contracts inclusive of options will not exceed $200,000,000.  The total term of the contract, including all options, will not exceed 60 months.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure professional services on a sole source basis with Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, to continue services currently being provided by the contractor under an existing purchase order.  The period of performance starts on April 1, 2002 through March 31, 2003 with three (3) one-year option periods.  The contractor will continue to provide subject indexing using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) describing the contents of each article in biomedical journals published in Scandinavian languages.  Procedures and policies are detailed in established NLM guidelines, including the NLM Indexing Manual, MeSH annotation and other NLM-generated indexing aids such as Technical Memoranda.  Indexers will access the online record for each article and review the descriptive data which have been provided for each one (pagination, language, authors, author affiliation and title).  The major effort involves the intellectual analysis of each article for subject content and the application of appropriate subject headings, publication types and qualifiers drawn from MeSH.  The immediate and continuous commitment of a professional service contractor is necessary to add new citations to MEDLINE in a timely manner, as soon as possible after the publication of the journal literature.  The Karolinska Institute has been providing indexing for this task since the 1980s.  Their indexers are trained in MEDLARS indexing policies and have many years of satisfactory performance.  Introducing a new contractor at this point in time would add significant amount of time, government coordination, and therefore costs to the government.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide professional service as stated above.  Responses should sufficiently demonstrate the firm's ability to meet the government's requirements.  Responses are required within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. NLM-02-093-UHP.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, NLM on (301) 496-6127.

The Contractor shall provide, within the states of Michigan and Ohio, all facilities, materials, supplies, equipment, labor, and services required to successfully manage single family (1-4 units) properties which are HUD-Owned Properties and to successfully market HUD-Owned Properties.  The primary objectives of this Contract are to ensure that:

B.	HUD-Owned Properties are protected and preserved, properly managed, evaluated, and marketed in a manner which produces the highest possible return to HUD's mortgage insurance funds.
C.	Under-Contract Properties are promptly closed and, if not, they are returned to the sales market at an early date.
D.	HUD's net sales proceeds are promptly wired to its Treasury account.
E.	Average losses on sales and the average time properties remain in inventory are reduced.
F.	The overall program, and the image of HUD's properties, is positive and complaints are minimal.
Any potential contractor must demonstrate the capability to perform the full complement of M&M services by July 1, 2006 or the effective date of the contract, whichever date is sooner.  Interested parties may contact HUD to obtain a complete copy of the relevant solicitation by contacting Elisa Weise at Elisa_Weise@hud.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) System

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is undertaking a project to integrate processing, deposition and analysis tools for studying photovoltaic materials and devices.  All tools will be built to accommodate a platen that is 7 inches by 7 inches squared, capable of accommodating substrates up to 6 inches by 6 inches squared.  The equipment will be installed in the new Science and Technology Facility at NREL. 

One of the first analysis tools to be purchased by NREL for this project will be a Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) system.  NREL envisions an instrument that will be compact, mobile, highly automated, and capable of being interfaced to other vacuum systems. The capability for sputter depth profiling is required. Mapping is desirable but not mandatory. The system should be able to access all areas on the 6 inches by 6 inches squared sample. Typically the AES tool will be docked to a robotic cluster tool, but it should also be capable of standalone operation.   

If you are interested in receiving the full set of specifications for the AES system in a formal Request for Proposal from NREL, please submit your contact information only to the following no later than May 3, 2006:

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Weather Service (NWS), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is posting this Request for Information (RFI) announcement because the NWS anticipates acquiring a number of server platforms for the NWS Telecommunication Gateway (NWSTG) Backup System currently under development at the NWS Telecommunication Operation Center in Silver Spring, Maryland.  The total number of servers acquired will be determined by the capacity and capability of the units selected. The servers will functionally replicate approximately thirty five (35) IBM RS/6000 UNIX (AIX) servers of varying age, capacity, and capability that comprise the operational infrastructure of the Gateway Server Center (GSC), a subset of the NWSTG.  Functional replication of all applications currently operating on GSC servers is essential to the implementation of the NWSTG Backup System and thereby essential for NWS to achieve critical infrastructure protection.

NWS OCIO is seeking varied concepts and innovative approaches to achieve functional replication of the GSC servers.  The proposed solutions must support without modification all of the GSC software applications currently executed under the AIX (V4.3/V5.1) operating system as well as currently implemented COTS application to include AFS, IBM EdgeServer, and Sybase. Flexibility through server consolidation and dynamic resource allocation, partitioning, scalability, reliability through fault avoidance, and compactness are also necessary attributes for the optimal solution.  

A complete list of the current servers that must be functionally replicated is attached as Appendix A.  The proposed solution must provide equivalent or better aggregate performance for the servers listed. 

In order to fulfill the objective of acquiring the servers in FY2004, NWS OCIO will utilize established GSA schedules and/or other Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) as appropriate.  

One of the principal outcomes of RFI responses will be to ensure that all viable technical approaches are considered.  NWS OCIO will consider input received in response to this RFI as it continues to develop its acquisition strategy to take into account viable acquisition alternatives. NWS OCIO may conduct one-on-one communications in an effort to benefit fully from industry responses to this RFI.
 
In addition to using the information provided by vendors to assist us in our acquisition strategy, NWS OCIO may also use the information to determine which vendors do not appear to be viable candidates for the eventual acquisition award.  However, if those vendors choose to remain in the competition and later submit proposals, the Team will not be prejudiced by its initial determination.  Any vendor that requests, will receive a written or oral explanation of the Team's initial determination as it pertains to that vendor.  

It is not the Government's intent to disclose vendor proprietary information and trade secrets to the public.  The information submitted by vendors during the pre-solicitation period may be used by the Government in preparing its acquisition strategy provided this can be done without disclosing proprietary vendor information that is protected from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations.

Interested vendors should respond in writing to the following topics:

(a) A description of a proposed hardware configuration that provides computational capability and network throughput equivalent to the servers listed in Appendix A.  The description must address how the proposed system will meet NWSTG Backup GSC performance requirements.

(b) A description of the support services which will be provided to install, configure, and maintain the  
	 NWSTG Backup GSC.

(c) A description of the vendor's qualifications for providing the NWSTG Backup GSC (including the extent 
	of subcontracting) and past experience in providing and supporting relevant server systems.

(d) Section 508 compliance information on all proposed systems

(e) Product warranty and maintenance support availability

(f) Statement addressing software compatibility issues given that the proposed solutions must support 
	without modification all GSC software applications developed for and currently executing under the AIX 
	(V4.3/V5.1) operating system as well as currently implemented COTS applications to include AFS, IBM 
	EdgeServer, and Sybase.
						


Interested parties may also submit comments or suggestions in addition to or in lieu of a written approach.  Those comments are welcome, but will not be considered an approach for the purpose of advising vendors as to their viability as candidates for the planned competition.  For the comments/suggestion submission, the vendor is encouraged to provide any comments or recommendations it may have on technology, acquisition strategy, contractual mechanism or other issues that would assist the Team in accomplishing the acquisition. 
  
Vendors responding should provide a point-of-contact, including:  representative's name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number.  Written submissions in response to this RFI should not exceed ten (10) pages (including charts and graphs).  Please submit digital copies to the Contracting Officer (William.Voitk@noaa.gov) in either WordPerfect or Word formats. Benchmark results should be summarized in an attachment to the written RFI response, not to exceed four pages.   It is requested for responses to be received by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on Monday, March 22, 2004.  

Responses should be addressed to the Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Acquisition Management Division, 1305 East West Highway, SSMC4, Room 7504, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 Attn: Jenista M. Featherstone.  Further information may be obtained by contacting Jenista M. Featherstone at (301) 713-0828 x184, Fax (301) 713-0809, E-Mail at Jenista.M.Featherstone@noaa.gov.  See Note 26.

Note:  Vendors need not respond to this RFI as a prerequisite for participating in the acquisition.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/RFQ for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Subparts 12 & 12, as supplemented with additional information included in this Notice.  This notice constitutes the only RFQ; proposals are being requested via this notice; a separate solicitation will not be issued.  The IRS seeks contractor services to provide on-line automated valuation of residential real estate in the major populations centers of the US.  The North American  Industry Classification System code is 531320; the small business size standard is $1.5 million.  The RFQ number is TIRNO-06-B-00001.  A fixed-rate, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, task order contract will be awarded from this RFQ.  The guaranteed min is $10,000/max is $750,000 per contract year.  Offers are due 3:00 PM, EST, May 8, 2006 ; Rm.500 at the above address.  Submit your questions via e-mail to jean.mcleod@irs.gov.  This RFQ & the incorporated clauses/provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-07(as of 02/2006).  The following FAR clauses: 52.212-4 and 52.212-5.  The following FAR clauses cited in clause 52.212-5 paragraphs (a) & (b) are applicable: 52.222-26; 52.222-35; 52.222-36; 52.222-37; 52.217-8 & 52.217-9.  FAR clause 52.212-3 must be submitted with any offer.  These & all other FAR clauses referenced in this CBD/RFQ notice are accessible via the INTERNET at http://www.arnet.gov.far.  PERFORMANCE PERIOD – 12 Mo. from the date of the award with 4, 1 YR Options,  however, it is highly desirable that vendors propose 2 different payment methods.  First - On a  per ‘hit’ basis.   It is highly desirable that the IRS be charged each time a positive response on an address is received with the exception of a 2nd request on the same address with 30 days to allow for quality review research.  Second – A flat monthly rate for unlimited ‘hits’ to the database.  The IRS estimates the need to access the system approximately 3,000 times per month for real-estate valuation.  This is required to allow the IRS to perform quality review of completed Offer in Compromise (OIC) submissions incurring additional processing costs.   It is highly desirable that the IRS is not charged for hit when the Contractor is unable to provide a property valuation report.   Likewise, it is highly desirable that multiple requests on the same address shall only be charged one hit per calendar month.  The Contractor shall provide all associated services & otherwise do all things necessary for or incidental to providing on-line real estate valuation services for the IRS.  The proposed rates shall be applicable for all contract periods.  CLIN/0001 – On-line automated valuation reports on residential real estate.  GEN. INFO – IRS Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE) Operating Div. will proceed with centralization of certain OIC processes.   To that end, SB/SE requires the services of a contractor with an established methodology and the demonstrated experience/expertise to provide on-line, via the Internet, automated valuation of residential real estate in the major population centers of the US.  The IRS seeks Contractor assistance in valuation of real property identified in the centralized processing of taxpayer OIC submissions.  Information shall be available that incorporates nearly all-major metropolitan areas of the US WORK REQUIREMENTS – The system employed shall provide instant property valuation for the subject property based entirely on comparable sales data where available and on data correlation and/or other statistical interpretations of market value when direct comparison is not available.  The Contractor shall provide on-line access to automated valuation results on residential real estate estimates the most likely current selling price of a property.  It is highly desirable for each report to contain a confidence indicator or score to assist the IRS to determine how well the data set supported the valuation analysis, along with a listing of any comparable sales utilized.  Billing shall be by unique users ID and contain sufficient detail to allow validation of charges against current OIC case inventory.   The Contractor shall maintain records of each IRS employees’ activity on the system, including, but not limited to: Log-in and log-out times, or Log in-time and duration of session and Number of searches.  At a minimum, the Contractor shall maintain records of the maximum number of users accessing the system each hour, during periods of 7:00 AM EST through 1:00 AM EST of the following day.   The Contractor shall provide this system usage report for every day the system has been accessed.  It is highly desirable that all reports (monthly/quarterly/annually) be loaded to a URL for access by the COTR for billing validation and system monitoring purposes.  Reports shall be in the following formats: Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative’s (COTR) Report – This report shall provide the overall total billing for the entire contract package, subtotaled by each of the System Administrators’ coverage areas.  System Administrator’s Report (SAR): - This report shall provide total billing for each System Administrator’s coverage area (Holtsville, NY and Memphis, TN), subtotaled by each of the sites.  The Contractor shall provide 700 unique user IDs shall provide access to services giving the IRS the widest data match possible.   Service lapses shall not exceed 1 day.  If the Contractor is not able to provide on-line access for any period exceeding 1 day, the Contractor shall notify the COTR with a description/explanation of the problem and the anticipated service restoration date.  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS – System access shall be available via the INTERNET using a WINDOWS-NT operating system.  INTERNET Access – The IRS requires secure access to a commercial web-server maintained by the Contractor.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Holding vessels measure 42 high x 11 long and 42 high x 7.5 (bottom tapered) wide x 11.5 long. 3.	Rock Island Arsenal personnel shall dewater tanks and remove cover grates prior to arrival of contractor. 4.	Non-hazardous material shall be transported to a landfill for disposal as an alternative use media.  Contractor is responsible for all permits and fees. 5.	The tanks require cleaning approximately every 3  4 weeks.  Scheduling shall be on a as needed basis.  The reponse time shall be within 12 hours of a call from RIA personnel. 6.	Time to complete job shall not be more than one shift (8 hour period) 7.	Contractor will need at least a 5,000 high cfm wet/dry vacuum loader truck.  Since both tanks are to be cleaned during the same 8 hour period, contractor will probably need 2 trucks. A recent determination has been made that now identifies the holding vessels (RIA #33531 and RIA #33674) as those meeting the definition of confined space. Per RIAR 385-10, paragraph 16.5  All spaces on the RIA shall be considered Permit Required Confined Spaces.  This is being done to include the implementation of Confined Space Entry permit procedures.  This is to include submission of a written Confined Space Entry plan, procedures for issuing confined space entry work permits, verification of completed confined space entry training and samples of the confined space entry permit.

<CONTACT>Lezlin  Proctor, Agency Administrator, Phone (662) 624-8600, Fax (662) 624-8537, Email bids@dra.gov
<DESC>When this project is complete, the Authority expects to:

1.	Have a complete, five-year DRA regional development plan, which establishes guiding principles, priorities and performance measures, then provides such information to each participating member state and each local development district overlapping the DRA footprint,

2.	Assist each participating member state with the development of its five-year, performance-based DRA development plan, to the point of approval by the DRA Board,

3.	In the development of both the DRA plan and each state’s plan, this process is to ensure that “local voices are heard” during the policy development process by using surveys, meetings, conferences, focus groups, and other outreach methods,

4.	Maintain programs which better coordinate federal and state investment and do not duplicate other programs, allowing DRA to seek and secure unique opportunities to complete “unfilled” grant niches,

5.	Partition the five-year outcome projection into five sets of annual outcome measures, Create and maintain effectiveness outcomes to a five-year horizon, which will form the vision to establish a “rolling five-year strategic plan” (PART), 

6.	On an annual basis, completely integrate its programs, policy initiatives, priorities, performance measures, budget and management,

7.	Utilize a performance-program budget system, where each function of the DRA’s organization will have personnel and resources explicitly tied to performance measures,

8.	Through the concept, DRA will coordinate with federal, state and local entities to emphasize sub-regional and region-wide economic development; while localized projects will always have a place in the DRA federal grant program, the Authority recognizes the need for regional projects – the region’s distressed communities are to improve their economic conditions,

9.	Encourage creation and use of “Regional Prosperity Alliances” (RPA) though the region’s local development districts and better integrate each LDD’s CEDS into the DRA planning processes and

10.	Provide economic development “tool kits” and “critical-mass benchmarks” to the sub-regions for their use in developing RPAs.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for janitorial services for the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The general scope of work for these services will require the contractor to furnish all personnel, supplies, materials, and cleaning equipment in the performance of building janitorial services for approximately 3.0M square feet of office space, classrooms, etc., in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).   Requirements are further defined in the attached SOW.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options. This acquisition is set-aside exclusively for competitive award among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs) that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.  Only those 8(a) firms that are certified under the SBA in Area VI (AR, LA, NM, OK, and TX) will be allowed to participate in this requirement.  To be considered, a vendor must be classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561720, Janitorial Services - $15/million.  Each firm claiming 8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this Announcement/SIR1.  Firms are to submit an FAA Business Declaration form with your response to this Announcement/SIR1.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each vendor's program eligibility. Should an 8(a) vendor intend to incorporate a teaming arrangement, the term "vendor" shall apply to the prime contractor. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.   This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the Announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies that are certified under the 8(a) program with SBA within Area VI an opportunity to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this Announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this Announcement/SIR1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this Announcement/SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable). 	1.  8(a) Certification and Business Declaration Form: 	(a) Provide certification letter from SBA documenting vendor's enrollment in the SBA's 8(a) program and classification as a small business under the North American Industry Classification system (NAIC) code 561720, Janitorial Service. 	(b) Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form. 2.  Past Performance and Experience: (Note: Past performance represents "how well" an offeror accomplished the effort.  Experience simply means an offeror has "done it."  Of additional importance is that past performance and experience must be current and relevant as well as comparable in scope and magnitude to that described in the SOW.) 	(a) In order to be determined acceptable vendors must have a minimum of five (5) years experience in performing janitorial/custodial services as identified in the attached SOW.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.  Vendors shall provide a list of relevant past and present contracts performed for Federal, State, or Local Governments or commercial sources within the past five (5) years involving effort of same or similar complexity, magnitude, and level.  The vendor's documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information stated below. (i)	Contract number and contract type (ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.) (iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) (iv)	A brief description of the contract effort (v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort (vi)	Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the  	Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government  	contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX  	numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc. 	(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendor's performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 3.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must demonstrate the capability to provide management and staffing commensurate with the demands of this requirement in the following areas: 	(a) Vendors must demonstrate that an on-site Project Manager, Supervisor and Shift Managers will be available at the time of contract award.  The Project Manager must have a minimum of four (4) years management experience in all phases of operations and functions of janitorial/custodial service at a facility at a level equivalent with the scope of work of this requirement.  Supervisors and/or shift manager's must have at least three (3) years of janitorial/custodial experience and two (2) years of supervisory experience with five (5) years total experience in all phases and functions of janitorial/custodial services at a facility at a level equivalent with the scope of work of this requirement.  The documentation describing the individual's qualifications may include a brief synopsis or resume of work experience.  It should include present position or title, experience in managing contracts for similar services of scope and size (include duration or length of all experience), and educational/training background in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and management competence. 	(b) Vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed 50 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to, a spreadsheet identified month by month for the annual period containing a list of employees and the contracts on which they performed or a signed certified list of employees with date of employment including employees managers and the manager's qualification. A copy of the current contract and modifications, (DTFA-02-02-D-00354), can be downloaded from the AMQ Internet at http:\\amq.mmac.faa.gov (click on FOIA Reading Room). Interested firms that can comply with and meet the special standards of responsibility addressed in this Announcement/SIR 1 should respond with their documentation in writing to: Federal Aviation Administration Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center NAS Contracting Division Attn:  AMQ-210/Phyllis Townsley Room 321, Multi-Purpose Building 6500 South MacArthur Blvd. P.O. Box 25082 Oklahoma City, OK  73125-4933 Note: For overnight mail the ZIP code is 73169 The date and time for receipt of responses is 3:30 p.m. local time, April 17, 2006, (facsimile responses are not permitted).  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined unacceptable; therefore, not considered as one of the qualified companies.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary. AMS Clause, 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting, AMS Provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals, and AMS Provision 3.9.1-3, PROTEST, are applicable to this SIR1.

This purpose of this Amendment is to provide official responses to additional vendor questions.

See Amendment 0003 for attachments and further information.

The Proposal Due Date remains unchanged as 4:00 pm EDT May 1, 2006. Offerors must provide a signed copy of this Amendment with their proposal.



SYNOPSIS FOR SOLICITATION DG1350-06-RP-0029


The Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Office of Travel and Tourism requires contractor services for the development and support of a process to administer a monthly In-Flight Survey of International Travelers. Competed in accordance with FAR Part 15. This survey will provide statistical market data about the international air passenger travel market.  This is a pre-solicitation notice.

The data collected by this survey reflects the characteristics of the international travel population, with the collections proportionately coming from markets for inbound travel as well as destinations visited by U.S. travelers abroad.  This survey is the sole source for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates for travel and passenger fare exports and imports, as well as multiple other Federal and private sector industry clients.  Quarterly estimates are produced from the survey based on reporting of monthly samples. By distributing the sample throughout each month of the quarter, the seasonal variances in travel patterns are reflected in the survey.  Due to the seasonal travel patterns of international travelers, the third quarter tends to be the largest survey period.  

This acquisition is set aside exclusively for small business concerns under authority of Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.203.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541910 and the related size standard is $6.5 million.  A solicitation will be posted to this Government wide point of entry on or about Tuesday, 21 February, 2006.  The Government estimates a fixed price contract to be awarded based on competition for one twelve month period and four twelve month option periods.  The estimated level of effort based on historical experience is 70,000-95,000 respondents per year.  There is considerable demand for a much larger sample, and potential contractors will be encouraged to develop strategies and methods to increase the sample of the program given financial constraints due to funding available.  

The Government foresees holding a pre-proposal conference for this acquisition approximately mid-March, during which potential contractors may obtain better understanding of the work required.  Further details relating to date, time, and location will be included in the solicitation.  Further information on the In-Flight Survey program can be found at the OTTI website: http://tinet.ita.doc.gov/research/programs/ifs/index.html

This notice is issued pursuant to FAR 15.202, Advisory multi-step process.  This notice contains a description of a new requirement and instructions on how companies should respond.  This notice is not the actual solicitation, but is for the purpose of determining which companies are interested and to evaluate their solution viability prior to soliciting proposals.  GSA will notify companies responding to this notice if they are invited to participate in the resultant acquisition, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  If a company is determined not to be a viable competitor, they are not precluded from submitting a proposal once the actual solicitation is issued.  The solicitation for this requirement is expected for release within the next 30 days.  This notice does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government, and does not guarantee that an actual solicitation or a contract will be issued.

Workload management consists of a layered software capability that is tightly integrated with the HPC system’s operating system and/or native resource manager.  The WMS accepts all users requests for computational resources (processors, memory, software) and schedules those requests against the available resources on the system to help ensure an overall most efficient use of the total system (s’) resources while meeting the operating policies specified by the organization.  HPCMP HPC resources are currently operated primarily in a batch mode but there are increasing instances of requirements for alternate and more complex workload management capabilities. 
1.3  The resulting contract from this acquisition will provide a commercial software capability to address all WM requirements on all HPCMP allocated systems and test systems supporting allocated systems.  An allocated system is a DoD HPCMP HPC system for which all or some substantial sub-set of the CPU hours available on that system are allocated to DoD projects with multiple users operating under each project.  Each project is annually allocated a specific number of CPU hours and as that project uses those CPU hours, the project’s allocation is decremented.  Test systems are small systems of like architecture to larger production systems that the Centers or the HPCMP office use to test new software configurations or capabilities.  It is anticipated that the selected WMS will first be deployed on HPCMP systems planned for delivery in the June 2007 timeframe.  The actual solicitation will request a transition plan for existing systems.  
1.4  The product of this acquisition is “linked” to another acquisition of HPC systems that the HPCMP conducts annually known as Technology Integration XX (TI-XX) where XX is the fiscal year of system deployment.  The TI-XX acquisition requires HPC OEMs to delivery large HPC systems to HPCMP Centers such as the MSRCs and ADCs.   Included in the TI-XX acquisition are requirements for acceptance testing and follow-on HW and SW maintenance.  The Government intends to include in all TI-XX acquisitions from this point forward a requirement for the TI-XX winning offeror to accept the selected HPCMP WMS as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), integrate the WMS into their offering and include it in their acceptance testing and HW/SW maintenance terms and conditions; i.e. if the HPC system fails to perform and it is the fault of the WMS, it is the TI-XX vendor’s responsibility to resolve the issue.  Note that the Government’s WMS software maintenance contract is available to them as GFE to assist in the resolution of the problem.  Accordingly, all TI-07 (and beyond) acquisitions will include the above-described requirement.
1.5  TI-XX contract awards are typically made to one to three vendors for two to four systems each year.  Awards are typically made in late December or early January with system deliveries in the May-June timeframe and full acceptance by September.  Should TI offerors choose not to share their offerings with the WMS contractor earlier due to acquisition sensitive issues, the WMS contractor would be required to port and test their product to the selected systems between mid-January to May.  This is an important requirement to be sensitive to as the lack of a WMS (supplied as GFE to the TI vendor) would be an excellent opportunity for the TI vendor to leverage the non-functional GFE as the reason for a delayed delivery; avoiding late delivery penalties.  In such cases, the Government reserves the right to hold the WMS vendor responsible.
1.6 Because this software is so integrated into the TI machines and is instrumental in determining success of the TI systems as described above in paragraphs 1.4 and 1.5, the Government has determined that it is in its best interest to limit this acquisition to companies who are original software developers of a commercial product (sometimes referred to as OEMs – except it is software instead of equipment).  Three factors contribute to this decision:
a.  The porting and testing of the software product to the various TI acquired systems will require the intense involvement of the original software developers and their relationships with the TI vendors.  Adding a reseller function into this requirement increases the complexity of the relationships introducing added indirect and/or direct costs, increased risk and little or no added value; i.e. it’s most efficient for the TI vendor to work directly with the WMS OEM.   
b.  The pursuit of a commercial product is desirable as investments made by the OEM over the 10-year contract duration to address other commercial requirements can be leveraged to address DoD requirements and visa versa; allowing the DoD to leverage the commercial product development activities toward lower product and maintenance costs.  
c.  The requirement for the TI vendors to participate in the installation of the product coupled with the ability to leverage existing technical services contracts already in place at the Centers for sustainment alleviates the need for additional professional services; the area where a reseller would typically add value.
1.7 Historical TI investments have ranged from $30-40M annually.  Additional intermittent investments can occur at the ADCs.  Some have been as significant as $30M in a given year.  Commensurate with the annual investment, the HCPMP typically decommissions systems that are 48 months or older.  There is also sometimes a short overlap of a few months when new installations are in place and those systems planned for decommission have not yet been removed; requiring a short burst for additional WMS capability.  Figure 1 and 2 show the HABU (one HABU equivalent represents the equivalent performance of the weighted DoD benchmark suite on a 1024 CPU IBM power 3 system) and GF counts acquired via the historical investments and decommissioning of systems.  These growth curves coupled with the Offeror’s projections of potential growth from continued like investments may serve as a valuable resource for assessing the WMS requirement.  
2.0  Technical Requirements:
2.1  The WMS should support the basic job queuing, job scheduling and accounting capabilities associated with a traditional WMS operating in a multi-user environment.  The DoD also desires functionality such as advanced reservation, dynamic load balancing, job migration, allow job interdependencies including job-changing, dynamic reconfiguration, manage multiple tasks and threads, among other features.  In addition, WM across multiple systems (cross-system and/or cross-Center queuing and scheduling) located in multiple geographically distributed locations with integrated security, accounting and data management is desired.  
2.2  The overall technical functionality of the company’s software will be evaluated as a part of this pre-solicitation notice.  In response to this pre-solicitation notice, it is requested that the potential Offeror submit a Not To Exceed 4 page description of their product’s technical capabilities.  
2.3  Specific technical functionality will be specified in the actual solicitation along with a request for a more extensive description of how the Offeror’s product addresses each requirement.  In addition, the actual solicitation will require demonstration testing.
3.0 Support Requirements:
3.1  Currently the HPCMP’s allocated hardware resource suite consists of approximately 25 individual HPC systems (7 with more than 2000 processors/cores) with 8 different operating systems and 8 different interconnect technologies from 5 different HPC manufacturers.  See www.asc.hpc.mil/consolidated/hardware.php for a list of most of the currently deployed systems.  Deploying a common WMS across this diverse environment as well as addressing the continuously changing landscape of HPC technology that will be deployed over the next 10 years will require a significant capability and commitment from the Offeror to rapidly respond to this extensive and ever-changing set of requirements.  
3.2  In response to this pre-solicitation notice, please provide a company profile, the company’s business focus, existing products, level of resources (specifically dedicated to software development and testing for the WMS commercial software product) available to be responsive to this requirement, the history of the WMS product and the relationships, agreements or arrangements the company has with existing HPC OEMs for porting and supporting  the WMS product on their systems.  In addition, please outline any unique or customized management and/or technical infrastructures that would be put in place to address the DoD HPCMP requirement.  The Support Requirements response should not exceed 2 Pages.  
3.3  The actual solicitation will request similar information and include an extensive evaluation of the Offeror’s ability to develop, port, test, deploy and sustain a commercial software product that can meet the DoD HPCMP’s requirement.        
4.0  Past Performance
4.1  Given the critical role the WMS serves in the HPCMP’s 24x7 production environment and the long-term nature of this contract, it is important for the Government to reduce risk by carefully assessing the offeror’s historical track record with regard to supporting an environment like the HPCMP’s.  In response to this pre-solicitation notice, please include references to existing installations of the company’s product with information such as organization or company name, system size, operating system, communication protocols used; i.e. MPI, Open MP, SHMEM, MLP,…, the interconnect/switch technology (or product name), and the nature of the workload; i.e. many single processor jobs, a few large processor jobs dominating the system, average job size of a quarter the system size backfilled with smaller jobs,….  The Past Performance response should not exceed 2 Pages.
4.2.  The actual solicitation will request specific POC information for various installations and permission for the Government to contact these individuals.
5.0  Price
5.1  The HPCMP considers this contract to be a long term, mutually beneficial relationship with the WMS provider.  The following are important factors that the DoD HPCMP can contribute to the partnership:
a.  The surfacing technical and operational requirements that will provide a company with opportunities to enhance the commercial product to make it more competitive in the overall commercial marketplace.
b.  The highlighting of significant accomplishments of implementations on large scale systems and/or a broad-scale HPCMP-wide deployments, for example, the deployment of cross-queuing and scheduling capabilities across DoD systems and Centers. 
b.  Provide exposure of offerors’ product and its capabilities to many DoD users including government, contractor and university scientists and engineers performing computational investigations.  These users may in turn choose to separately (separate from this contract) acquire and deploy offerors’ product for systems operated under their administration.  
c.  Provide opportunities for ports of offerors’ software product to new HPC systems with a high degree of collaboration (via contractual requirements) with HPC OEMs.  This positions the offerors’ product for early commercial availability to other customers.
In turn, the HCPMP requires that the licensing model for the product and associated maintenance services be priced in the context of this long-term partnership.  In addition, it is of value for the HPCMP to have annual cost predictability independent of the outcome of the TI-deployments.  It is requested that the company provide an annual firm fixed price for sufficient commercial software products and maintenance services to meet the requirements for the 10-year life of the contract.  For purposes of this notice, request the company submit commercial product pricing, and any information regarding special pricing arrangements for potential offering to the HPCMP.  Do not submit a detailed pricing proposal.  The Pricing response should not exceed 2 pages.

<DESC>This request for information by Government Services Administration (GSA) is for hardware, software, and/or managed backup solution for a multi-OS server environment. 

The current environment consists of approximately 100 Windows servers, and a Network Appliance cluster running Data ONTAP version 7.0.3. The current backup is being provided by Veritas NetBackup 8.6, 3 Exabyte x80 tape loaders, and Mammoth 2 tapes. The total amount of data to be backed up will not exceed 15 Terabytes. The solution should also be compatible with Linus/Unix systems that may be added to the environment in the future.  

The GOALS of this request are to decrease the current full backup window to at most 10-12 hours; increase the flexibility of backups between server OS versions; increase the reliability of information restored from backup with hardware and software; and reduce the amount of time to restore information by providing an administrator interface that accurately reflects location of data. At lease one copy of the backup must be capable of being stored off-site.

The Government point of contact (POC) for this RFI is Jerry Shead, 816-823-4661. Response to this RFI is requested to be no later than May 19, 2006. Any technical questions should be submitted by e-mail to jerry.shead@gsa.gov. Currently no solicitation exists, and this Request for Information does not constitute any obligation on behalf of the Government to ever issue a solicitation.  Please forward all responses to Jerry W. Shead, GSA/FTS/R06/6TS, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131.

1 – What is the LAN / network topology?  Is everything to be backed up on a single local LAN?  Is the backbone 100 Mb per second or 1000 Mb per second?
A) Currently there is a single vlan with primarily 100Mb backbone with 1000Mb capability available.  

2 – Of the 15 TB of data, how much is within the NetApp filers and how much is outside of the NetApp filers?
	A) Of the 15TB of data, the NetApp can contain up to 12TB. 

3 – What protocols are being used on the NetApp filers?  CIFS?  iSCSI?  Fibre Channel?
	A) The NetApp filers are using the CIFS protocol.

4 – Is there a defined retention period for the data?  How long does the data need to be available for an automated restore?
A) The retention period for the data is 7 years.  The data needs to be readily available for 7 years for restore.  

5 – Is there a defined archive policy and archive period?  What backup sets need to go offsite (daily, weekly, monthly?) and how long does this need to be kept (6 months, 1 year, forever?)?
	A) Archive policy has not been clearly defined. 

6 – Can the offsite copy be on disk or must it be on tape?
	A) Offsite copy can be on disk, but disk must be readily available.

	A) Offsite copies are currently stored at an archive facility. 

8 – Disregarding data on the NetApp filers, how many (if any) servers have more than 100 GB of data?
	A) Five at the most.

9 – Is there a defined backup schedule (e.g. Full backup on weekends, incremental backup Monday through Thursday nights)?
A) Full backup on weekends with incremental's Monday though Thursday evenings.  
				
10 – Is there an estimate of how large daily incremental backups are?
	A)  Unknown

<DESC>THIS IS TO PROVIDE NOTICE THAT FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQs) WILL BE POSTED AGAINST THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  IT IS REQUESTED THAT ALL INTERESTED PARTIES TO PERIODICALLY VIEW THE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR ADDITIONAL FAQs THROUGH 22 MARCH 2004.
The Department of Commerce, National Weather Service (NWS), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is posting this Request for Information (RFI) announcement because the NWS anticipates acquiring a number of server platforms for the NWS Telecommunication Gateway (NWSTG) Backup System currently under development at the NWS Telecommunication Operation Center in Silver Spring, Maryland.  The total number of servers acquired will be determined by the capacity and capability of the units selected. The servers will functionally replicate approximately thirty five (35) IBM RS/6000 UNIX (AIX) servers of varying age, capacity, and capability that comprise the operational infrastructure of the Gateway Server Center (GSC), a subset of the NWSTG.  Functional replication of all applications currently operating on GSC servers is essential to the implementation of the NWSTG Backup System and thereby essential for NWS to achieve critical infrastructure protection.

NWS OCIO is seeking varied concepts and innovative approaches to achieve functional replication of the GSC servers.  The proposed solutions must support without modification all of the GSC software applications currently executed under the AIX (V4.3/V5.1) operating system as well as currently implemented COTS application to include AFS, IBM EdgeServer, and Sybase. Flexibility through server consolidation and dynamic resource allocation, partitioning, scalability, reliability through fault avoidance, and compactness are also necessary attributes for the optimal solution.  

A complete list of the current servers that must be functionally replicated is attached as Appendix A.  The proposed solution must provide equivalent or better aggregate performance for the servers listed. 

In order to fulfill the objective of acquiring the servers in FY2004, NWS OCIO will utilize established GSA schedules and/or other Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) as appropriate.  

One of the principal outcomes of RFI responses will be to ensure that all viable technical approaches are considered.  NWS OCIO will consider input received in response to this RFI as it continues to develop its acquisition strategy to take into account viable acquisition alternatives. NWS OCIO may conduct one-on-one communications in an effort to benefit fully from industry responses to this RFI.
 
In addition to using the information provided by vendors to assist us in our acquisition strategy, NWS OCIO may also use the information to determine which vendors do not appear to be viable candidates for the eventual acquisition award.  However, if those vendors choose to remain in the competition and later submit proposals, the Team will not be prejudiced by its initial determination.  Any vendor that requests, will receive a written or oral explanation of the Team's initial determination as it pertains to that vendor.  

It is not the Government's intent to disclose vendor proprietary information and trade secrets to the public.  The information submitted by vendors during the pre-solicitation period may be used by the Government in preparing its acquisition strategy provided this can be done without disclosing proprietary vendor information that is protected from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations.

Interested vendors should respond in writing to the following topics:

(a) A description of a proposed hardware configuration that provides computational capability and network throughput equivalent to the servers listed in Appendix A.  The description must address how the proposed system will meet NWSTG Backup GSC performance requirements.

(b) A description of the support services which will be provided to install, configure, and maintain the  
	 NWSTG Backup GSC.

(c) A description of the vendor's qualifications for providing the NWSTG Backup GSC (including the extent 
	of subcontracting) and past experience in providing and supporting relevant server systems.

(d) Section 508 compliance information on all proposed systems

(e) Product warranty and maintenance support availability

(f) Statement addressing software compatibility issues given that the proposed solutions must support 
	without modification all GSC software applications developed for and currently executing under the AIX 
	(V4.3/V5.1) operating system as well as currently implemented COTS applications to include AFS, IBM 
	EdgeServer, and Sybase.
						


Interested parties may also submit comments or suggestions in addition to or in lieu of a written approach.  Those comments are welcome, but will not be considered an approach for the purpose of advising vendors as to their viability as candidates for the planned competition.  For the comments/suggestion submission, the vendor is encouraged to provide any comments or recommendations it may have on technology, acquisition strategy, contractual mechanism or other issues that would assist the Team in accomplishing the acquisition. 
  
Vendors responding should provide a point-of-contact, including:  representative's name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number.  Written submissions in response to this RFI should not exceed ten (10) pages (including charts and graphs).  Please submit digital copies to the Contracting Officer (William.Voitk@noaa.gov) in either WordPerfect or Word formats. Benchmark results should be summarized in an attachment to the written RFI response, not to exceed four pages.   It is requested for responses to be received by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on Monday, March 22, 2004.  

Responses should be addressed to the Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Acquisition Management Division, 1305 East West Highway, SSMC4, Room 7504, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 Attn: Jenista M. Featherstone.  Further information may be obtained by contacting Jenista M. Featherstone at (301) 713-0828 x184, Fax (301) 713-0809, E-Mail at Jenista.M.Featherstone@noaa.gov.  See Note 26.

Note:  Vendors need not respond to this RFI as a prerequisite for participating in the acquisition.

<DESC>a.  Task 1, Office Automation Support:           (1) As directed by IOD, the contactor will provide database management and data input support, to include maintaining the website and existing database software, as well as inputting data required by EUCOM and DA theater security cooperation auto mation systems.  The contractor shall provide the following capabilities to support this task: ·	Perform requirements analysis, conceptualize, design and evaluate information management systems to automate IOD staff procedures, arms control reporting requirements, and planning for international military engagement activities.  Develop and tailor aut omation programs to support office operations and websites on the unclassified and classified networks using existing Microsoft software suite (Word, Excel, etc.).           (2) The contractor will provide user training and assistance to IOD staff on the operation of existing and contractor developed management tools and databases, including the two websites, Theater Security Cooperation database input, and Mil-to-Mi l, and Pol-Mil databases. Contractor assistance should be made available on-site in the IOD division. Historically, one employee on site with reach-back capability to the company has been sufficient.  Additionally, contractor will perform routine maintenan ce, troubleshooting and upgrades on its management tools and database to ensure compatibility of its systems with IOD hardware and software for the duration of this Task Order.       b.  Task 2, Regional Stability Operations Information Assessments:                (a) Contractor will provide planning support for USAREURs programs supporting various theater security cooperation contact programs in accordance with the Vienna Document (99). IOD has recurring demands for political-military, economic and  defense program analysis to evaluate the allocation of USAREUR resources to these regional stability operations. The contractor must be able to analyze USAREURs external environment (e.g. political climate, economic and social trends, legislation, custom er demand/expectations, changes and advancements in technology, emerging technology trends, and competitive conditions) to determine its effects and relationship on advancing the goals and direction of USAREUR operations. The contractor must be able to res pond with timely and frequently updated specialized technical military evaluations that can be formatted either into operations plans/orders or electronically transmitted to USAREURs forward support teams and forward deployed Operational Command Posts (OC P). This data will support headquarters functions of managing information and data related to planning and programming future regional stability country outreach programs. As appropriate, data and evaluations developed under this task will be submitted int o appropriate databases developed under paragraph 1a(1), Task 1 above.  Historically, this task has been performed by a combination of on-site personnel research efforts and reach-back support.                 (b) On a task order basis, the Contractor will research and analyze information resources on a country-by-country, regional or subject basis for individual study projects covering the 91 nations within the USAREUR Area of Interest (AOI).  Th e Government will provide the specific requirement to the contractor, who will respond with a firm fixed price proposal for that specific requirement.  If accepted by the Government, the task order will be finalized as a firm fixed price order.  The estima ted number of orders is indicated in CLIN xxxxx. In order to deliver appropriate products, the contractor must have an understanding of USAREURs regional stability and theater security cooperation (TSC) operations and be able to customize information prov ided to support ongoing and planned regional stability and TSC operations. Because the military, political climate, legislation, economic and social trends can change with great frequency in many nations in the USAREUR Area of Interest (AOI), USAREUR may require specific political-military and individual country expertise to provide pertinent information on an as-needed, as-ordered basis. Due to the volatilit y of the information contained in country resource projects or specific mission requirements, and often unforeseen changes in USAREUR operational priorities, USAREUR COR will issue such requests as separate, individual task orders.  When such products are requested, the Contractor will provide draft copies of each product to IOD for review prior to delivery of final version.       c.  Task 3, CG USAREURs Annual Strategic Research Program:  This program includes the preparation and conduct of workshops, conferences, CG Senior Officer Training, and Officer Professional Development meetings focused on collecting and analyzing dat a related to the technical military environment in Europe and impact of regional stability operations in the countries within the USAREUR AOI. The CG-hosted annual  Conference of European Armies focusing on a topic of special interest to the command is cen tral to this research program. Data and analysis resulting from the Strategic Research Program provides USAREUR senior leadership and staff with a better understanding of their complex technical military operating environment, and is integral to USAREURs regional stability and TSC operations.           (1) The contractor shall prepare and conduct the annual USAREUR-sponsored Conference of European Armies (CEA) on a topic of special interest to the command. The contractor will conduct analysis of USAREURs strategic environment and provide topic  recommendations to IOD no later than 1 November annually. The research conference should be planned for 75 persons in Heidelberg, Germany, and includes: ·	Not later than 1 December annually, the contractor will deliver an approach plan containing a proposed conference agenda, a timetable, list of conference subjects, proposed presenters, and proposed invitation list for approval by Headquarters, USAREUR. T his approach plan may also include proposed dates and subject agendas for two smaller but related and/or complementary research workshops. ·	Upon acceptance of the agenda, timetable, list of conference subjects, proposed presenters, and proposed invitation list, the contractor will contact proposed presenters to ascertain their availability and willingness to participate. The contractor shall  extend informal invitations to proposed presenters, as appropriate. Formal invitations will be issued by USAREUR. ·	Prepare and distribute appropriate support materials, such as brochures, agenda, conference schedule, administrative and substantive guidelines, and list of attendees.  In addition, reproduce and distribute to participants the post-conference CD-ROM prov ided by the Government.  Historically, three contractor personnel have supported the execution of the conference on a temporary duty basis; one individual for four weeks and two other individuals for two weeks. ·	Arrange for all conference logistics support, to include transportation, accommodations, meals, dinner/banquet, and on-site support. For each workshop and conference the contractor will plan a reception and meals. In addition, this may include such arran gements as an off-site informal dinner, simultaneous translation service, on-site audio-visual support, and computer support.  The costs for these items will be reimbursed separate from the firm fixed price portion of this contract under CLIN xxxxx. ·	Develop a written report to be delivered to Headquarters, USAREUR within 60 days of the research conference. The report shall, at a minimum, provide a synopsis of the conference presentations and discussions.           (2) On a task order basis, the contractor may be tasked to conduct one research workshop annually related to the conference described in Task 3(a). The research workshop wi ll be designed by the contractor to prepare for, follow-up, or complement the CEA research conference. For the research workshop, deliverables include items identified in Task 3(a).  The research workshop should be planned for 50 persons for a period of up  to 4 days at a location within the USAREUR AOI. Timing, location, and content of the workshops require prior IOD approval.  Since costs for the location and logistics support for this subtask are variable (as they are for CEA above), the costs for the log istical support will be reimbursed separate from the firm fixed price for the basic contract.           (3) Cost for research conference/workshop meals are allowable on a reimbursable basis, including government employees on TDY who will be instructed to forfeit reimbursement. Selected senior U.S. government personnel performing a substantive role may have all costs allowable, including air travel, on the basis that they will not apply for any reimbursement. Payment of honoraria to selected key speakers (e.g, retired flag officers and other non-U.S. Government experts performing a substantive role a t the conference) is allowable.  Costs under these subtasks are variable and, once approved in advance by the COR, are reimbursable separate from the firm fixed price for the basic contract.      d.  Task 4, Monthly Reports:  The contractor shall provide monthly cost and technical status reports of work in progress. Review of status of tasks including problems and corrective action taken/recommended will be addressed. These reports will be pro vided by the 15th day of each month and will cover the activities of the previous month and anticipated work of the next month       e.  Task 5, In-Progress Reviews:  The contractor project manager shall meet with the COR and IOD personnel on a semi-annual basis to review contractor performance during the proceeding six-months and identify any adjustments or modification in the sta tement of work necessary to accomplish activities planned for the coming six month period.   4.  Place of Performance: Contractors work will be conducted from both its corporate office and government facilities in the Washington, D.C. area and on-site at Headquarters, U.S. Army Europe, 168 Roemerstrasse (Campbell Barracks), D-69126 Heidelberg, Germany.  Historically, two contractor personnel have been assigned to G3-IOD Headquarte rs, USAREUR on an annual basis.  For the individuals assigned to G3-IOD, the government will provide individual logistics support (ILS) to those contract employees who are granted Technical Expert Status Accreditation from the appropriate German State Gove rnment (see Army in Europe Regulation 600-700, paragraph  7-1).  Historically, only one of the two positions, that of an automation and information technology specialist, has been granted Technical Expert Status.  For those contract personnel granted Techn ical Expert Status, the types of ILS granted to contractor employees are listed below.  These items are all at small incidental cost to the Government arising from the operation of similar support programs for military and government civilian employees.  T his paragraph does not grant any type of direct monetary benefit or compensation (similar to what Government civilian employees receive under the Department of State Standardization Regulations) to the contractor or the contractors employees directly.  Al l compensation from the Government to the contractor under this contract is included in the contact line item prices proposed by the contractor and accepted by the Government

<DESC>U.S. Government Seeks Expressions of Interest for Leased Office Space

The United States Government presently occupies office and related space in Champaign, Illinois, under a lease that expires August 31, 2006, and seeks potential sources for office space consisting of approximately 21,625 usable square feet located on contiguous floors, with 150 parking spaces.  The space bounded on the North by Olympian Drive, South by Curtis Road, East by Philo Road, and West by Staley Road.

Space must be fully serviced in a building capable of being altered to meet the Government’s needs, comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and will be subject to any and all other building or construction rules, regulations, laws and/or ordinances on the local, county, state and federal levels as they may apply.

Expressions of interest should include the proposed occupancy date, location of property, lease term, rental rate, operating costs, and any incentives that may affect the analysis of your proposal. 

The Government intends to use this information to determine the feasibility of relocating this office.  Alternative space will only be considered if it is economically advantageous.  This economic determination will include location, physical features of the building and surrounding areas, relocation costs, tenant improvements, and agency mission.    No award of a contract will be made based on proposals received in response to this notice.

Please mail or fax written proposals by 2:00 p.m. CST, April 21, 2006, to the following address:

OFFICE SPACE NEEDED

U.S. GOVERNMENT seeks sources for leased space
 through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program
OFFER SUBMISSION PERIOD OPEN 5/1/2006 – 5/7/2006

THIS NOTICE IS TO INFORM ALL OFFERORS THAT THE NEXT OPEN PERIOD WILL BE MAY 1ST THROUGH APRIL 7TH.

REQUIREMENTS:

The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) is a new web application enabling the electronic offering of building space for lease to the Federal Government.  This web application is located at the following internet address:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  In order to access this application, participants must first go to the AAAP website (at:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov) and select the “Register to offer space” link.  Please complete the online registration and the Government will notify you by email once a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) is posted to this website.  When you receive this email notification, you can submit your online offer using the AAAP. 

Offerors can typically submit offers beginning with the 1st day of the open period every month through the last day of the open period every month.  Typically, the last day of the open period will be the 7th day of every month.  (The official opening time and closing time for each offer period will be established on the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) website at aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.)

<DESC>The Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will oversee the awarding of extramural funds to identify, improve, and/or evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions (NPPHIs) to prevent or limit the international, national, or community spread of pandemic influenza.  

This Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit comments that will be used to determine the scope and content of DGMQ program announcements regarding applied research on the use of NPPHIs for pandemic influenza control.  The purpose of this research is to identify optimal NPPHIs or combinations of NPPHIs that may be implemented during pandemic phases 4, 5, and /or 6, as defined by the World Health Organization.  Since pandemic preparedness requires advance planning, this research would likely involve control of seasonal human influenza viruses or similar viruses that are spread predominantly by large respiratory droplets.  However, a secondary benefit of this research will be to develop and pilot-test methodologies that could be used at the onset of a pandemic to rapidly assess effectiveness of interventions against the pandemic strain.

This research will focus on experimental and field studies, including but not limited to surveys, observational studies, controlled trials, and laboratory studies, to help develop and/or evaluate effectiveness (including cost-effectiveness and practicality of implementation) of interventions or combinations of interventions.  The research will not include mathematical modeling studies, although it could include studies to develop estimates for parameters used in modeling studies.  This is not an RFI for comments related to the use of vaccines, antivirals, or other pharmaceutical agents for pandemic influenza control.  This RFI is not for comments related to infection control in healthcare settings.

There is no specified format or length for the responses to this RFI.  Respondents should specify whether the information they provide is primarily applicable to developed countries such as the United States, to countries in other stages of development, or both.  Respondents are encouraged to indicate useful research approaches, considerations that should be kept in mind in designing research studies, and opportunities available to them to add to the knowledge base on these issues.  Submission of information in response to this RFI does not imply that subsequent submissions or protocols will be funded by DGMQ or CDC.  

It is expected that the funding of this research on NPPHIs for the control of pandemic influenza will be divided into three domains:

Border containment. This domain includes strategies and interventions to prevent or delay the spread of a pandemic virus across international borders by inbound or outbound international travelers at airports, seaports, or land border crossings. 

Examples of interventions may include but are not restricted to: 
•Providing information to international travelers
•Health questionnaires that request information on symptoms and exposures
•Body temperature measuring devices such as thermal scanners
•Point-of-contact, rapid tests to identify persons infected with pandemic influenza strains
•Algorithms that include combinations of measures such as those listed above
•Measures to prevent or reduce influenza transmission on conveyances (such as airplanes or ships) -end-

Examples of studies that might provide data to support development and evaluation of new or existing methods might include but are not restricted to:
•Providing data on influenza-like illness (ILI) in arriving passengers
•Providing estimate of the proportion of influenza-infected arriving passengers who are in the incubation rather than symptomatic stage of the illness 
•Comparison of effectiveness of various methods of providing information to international travelers 
•Determining the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of international arrivals to the United States
•Evaluation of enroute surveillance and reporting of persons with ILI by crews on incoming international flights; evaluation of contact locating strategies -end-

Community containment. This domain includes strategies and interventions to contain or reduce transmission in communities.  Information is particularly requested for program announcements regarding strategies and interventions in communities in the United States that are impacted by health disparities.

Examples may include but are not restricted to:
•Providing information to the public and relevant population subgroups.
•Voluntary home isolation of ill persons and home quarantine of contacts.
•Closure of schools, cancellation of mass gatherings
•Workplace policies that require all symptomatic employees to stay home
•Protective sequestration of communities to delay or limit introduction of a pandemic strain
•Identification of high-transmission nodes (e.g., schools, workplaces, or buildings where increased rates of human-to-human transmission may occur -end-

Personal protective measures. This domain includes strategies and interventions that may be used by individuals to protect themselves and possibly also to reduce spread at the community level. 

Examples may include but are not restricted to:
•Providing information to the public
•Respiratory hygiene/ cough etiquette. 
•Hand hygiene
•Use of masks or respirators by well and ill people -end-

Information must be submitted by February May 5, 2006. Responses should be limited to 20 pages, 12 Font, Times Roman,  single space, one sided or equivalent in an electronic and hard copy formats and can be e-mailed to the attention of Jeff Miller, Contract Specialist, phone 770-488-2651, email afx2@cdc.gov.  Please ensure that at least one electronic and TWO (2) HARD COPIES of all responses are submitted.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV requires a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer for its HELD/PPRB branch.

This proposed contract action announces the Governments intent to issue a purchase order, on a sole-source basis to TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN.   The HELD/PPRB Inhalation Facility branch currently owns three TSI Scanning Mobility Particle Sizers (SMPS).  Custom interfaces have been constructed to allow these units to work with two inhalation exposure systems and a cough aerosol measurement system.  The oldest SMPS unit can no longer maintain flow rates within acceptable limits and has a radiation source that has expired.  The proposed purchase is for a new SMPS unit to replace the oldest one.  The oldest unit will be traded-in for credit on the cost of the new unit.  The new SMPS unit needs to be procured from TSI so that it is compatible with the existing hardware and software interfaces, and so that the SMPS units can be swapped directly for each other during servicing and calibration.   Because of the need for compatibility and interchangeability with existing equipment and software, other units were not considered.

This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe they can provide the required item are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the publication date of this synopsis.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  

This notice is issued for informational purposes only.  Any interested party may identify themselves to the contraction officer no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.

<SUBJECT>A--Market Survey - Request for Information on Oxygen Storage and Delivery Systems or Subsystems for use with Military Ram Air Parachute Systems
<SOLNBR>W911QY-06-S-0001
<RESPDATE>052606
<ARCHDATE>07252006
<CONTACT>Gary Thibault, 508-233-4302
<DESC>The Natick Soldier Center at the U. S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Natick, MA is conducting a market investigation on behalf of joint military customers to identify domestic products, suppliers, designers and manufacturers of gaseous oxygen storage and delivery systems (or subsystems) with the potential to meet emerging requirements for improved parachutist oxygen systems used with military high altitude ram air parachute systems.   Primary interest of this Survey to seek out a nd identify mature gaseous oxygen storage and delivery products/technologies, and firms with the requisite technical/design/manufacturing/production capabilities, that have the potential to provide an improved parachutists bail out oxygen subsystem and pos sibly an improved pre-breathing oxygen console which can be readily qualified for parachutist use with current military high altitude ram air parachute systems.  The current bail out system employed by joint users is the Para-Flite PHAOS bail out system, w hich includes a 120-cu in (floodable volume) bail-out bottle (Para-Flite Part No. 603200-0) pressured to 1850 psi and the PHAOS diluter/demand mask assembly (Para-Flite Part Nos. 603300, 603400, 603800 or 603810).  The current oxygen console employed by jo int users is the Para-Flite, 8 Man Oxygen Console (OXCON) (Para-Flite Part No. 605100-0) with three each 1000 cu in (floodable volume) bottles (pressurized to 1850 psi) supplying aviators oxygen to eight (8) breathing stations.  While these systems have s erved and continue to serve the joint military users well, there is an emerging need to enhance capabilities in the following areas: 1) increased breathing duration on the 120-cu in sized bottle, 2) simplified mask assembly with reduced maintenance and 3) increased breathing duration on the pre-breathing oxygen console.  Products/technologies may include an entire integrated system (pre-breathing oxygen console and parachutist bail out system) or individual subsystems (parachutist bail out subsystem, parachutist bail out oxygen storage subsystem, parachutist bail out mask or pre-breathing oxygen console) that address one or more of the enhanced capability areas and requirements described in this document.  1.

The breathing mask shall incorporate a communication capability and be physically and functionally compatible with the bail out oxygen storage subsystem described in the requirements below and interoperable with the current Para-Flite PHAOS 120 cubic  inch bail out bottle.    f. The breathing mask shall allow for a side mounted hose connection and the oxygen storage subsystem shall allow the routing of the oxygen hose between the parachutists   back and rigged harness/container and over the shoulder to prevent possible inte rference with chest mounted parachute activation handles.    g. The bail out oxygen storage subsystem, manifold, hoses, mask, regulator and other components that make up the parachutist bail out oxygen subsystem shall be capable of being positioned so as not to degrade the parachutists view nor the parachutists  access to ripcord handles, emergency handles, accompanying equipment and parachute flight controls; and shall not interfere with the parachutist exit, free-fall, parachute deployment, emergency procedures, canopy flight, equipment lowering and parachutist  landing.     h. The bail out oxygen storage subsystem  (with manifold, hose, mask, regulator and other components) must provide sufficient concentration and flow of oxygen to the parachutist from the time of disconnecting from the console through the exit and descen t under canopy from a pressure altitude of 35,000 feet to a pressure altitude of 10,000 feet, with a sea level, standard day storage capacity of 320 liters of oxygen or more.      i. The bail out oxygen storage subsystem must have an easily accessible and positive locking mechanism for the on/off valve that shall be locked in the on position when connected to the Pre-Breathing Oxygen console.  When connected to the Pre-Breathin g Console the higher pressure output of the console will automatically direct the flow of 100% aviators oxygen to the parachutist breathing mask and will automatically prevent breathing off of the bail out oxygen storage system. Oxygen shall flow automatic ally from the bail out oxygen storage subsystem to the breathing mask when disconnected from the Pre-Breathing Oxygen Console.     j. The bail out ox ygen storage subsystem shall have a manifold with a quick-disconnect outlet with an outlet pressure of 40-50 psig and shall be physically and functionally compatible with the breathing mask (described herein) and interoperable with the current PHAOS dilute r/demand mask.    k. The bail out oxygen storage subsystem shall be equipped with a Night Vision Device compatible luminescent pressure gauge (on the same side as the on/off valve locking mechanism) that displays storage pressure.    l. The bail out oxygen storage subsystem shall have a feature to indicate failure of oxygen flow (e.g., high resistance to inspiration) or an in-line indicator to demonstrate positive oxygen flow.  If an indicator is used it must be easily visible to th e parachutist, Jumpmaster and O2 Technician.    m. The bail out oxygen storage subsystem shall not exceed 120 cubic inch floodable volume and shall fit securely in the existing Military Javelin harness O2 pouch, which allows up to a 3.75-inch diameter cylinder.  The overall length of the bail out oxy gen storage subsystem, including the outlet manifold, shall not exceed 20 inches.    n. Frost or ice accumulation outside the bail out oxygen storage subsystem, manifold, hose and regulator, or inside or outside the mask shall not preclude proper operation of the system.     o. The parachutist bail out oxygen subsystem shall remain operable for at least 20 jumps over a period of up to 180 days before requiring unit level maintenance.  Unit level maintenance for the oxygen storage sub-system shall be not greater than 2.5 man  hours per system and unit level maintenance for the mask assembly shall not be greater than 2 man-hours per mask assembly. Interested sources must, within thirty (30) days following the first publication date of this synopsis, respond with information on their current commercial product(s)/technologies and how they might address this emerging Military requirement.

<SUBJECT>99 -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION for POSTAGE EVIDENCING DEVICE
<DESC>1.  INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is interested in qualified meter suppliers who are able to provide leased, USPS Postage Technology Management (PTM) approved, postage evidencing devices (PEDs) to selected retail stores across the nation that participate in the Contract Postal Unit (CPU) program and are current users of the RAMM (Realtime Accounting Management & Metering) mailing system supplied by Triner Scale.  Our goal is to provide customers with convenience and enhanced access to postal services by offering these services through retail partnerships.  

2.  SCOPE 

The meter supplier will be responsible for shipping the postage evidencing devices (the device) to retail outlets identified by the USPS.  The meter supplier will also be responsible for all CPU support and service functions for the complete solution (Mailing System and PED) including maintaining inventory of all equipment, shipping the devices via USPS to their destinations, initializing the devices, replacing damaged or broken devices, providing technical support to CPUs for set up and ongoing operations via a help desk, updating the system for functionality enhancements and rate changes, accumulating and reporting revenue and sales data and providing the consumables required for operating the systems.  

3.  REQUIREMENTS 

3.1  Introduction

All customer support supplied by the meter supplier, including but not limited to shipping of devices and repairing and replacing devices, must be in accordance with the following regulations:

- USPS Domestic Mail Manual, (Including but not limited to Section P030 - Postage Meters and Meter Stamps) at http://pe.usps.gov
- Title 39 Code of Federal Regulations part 501, Authorization to Manufacture and Distribute Postage Meters at  www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr
- Information Security Assurance (ISA) Process Publication at www.usps.com/cpim/ftp/hand/as805.pdf

3.2  Device Requirements

The meter supplier will provide a PED capable of being integrated into the RAMM system; all components must be electronically linked and operate as a unit. 

3.2.1	The current Mailing System is fully integrated; mail piece weight is automatically sent to the rating component and displayed to the operator, postage required is displayed to the operator and automatically provided to the postage evidencing device, and a successful print message and current PED status is provided back to the system after a successful print, receipts are automatically printed based on data available from the system. The meter supplier must supply a PED capable of being integrated into the system described above.

3.2.2 	The meter supplier must have the capability to transmit both revenue and daily sales data that originates from each CPU to the USPS and download postage at the device's site using the meter supplier’s USPS PTM approved computerized meter resetting system and an ACH debit process. This data must be accessible and printable at the CPU’s location. Additional performance reports will be required based on the data collected from the CPU and support activities.

3.2.3	The device must be designed for a CPU environment and be capable of reliable and jam free operation printing between 10 and 1000 Information Based Indicia (IBI) compliant impressions on an adhesive postage label per business day with widely varying times between transactions. The device must be able to complete a transaction in 6 seconds or less, beginning on receipt of the print command from the mailing system and ending when the postage label is available to the operator. This is not an average transaction time; no time to imprint can exceed 6 seconds.

3.2.4	All remote capabilities must be accomplished via dial up, using analog phone lines.

3.2.5	The meter supplier must provide quick reference guides and training materials to assist CPUs in the operation and troubleshooting of the device.

3.2.6	Device must automatically change the calendar date to the following calendar date at a pre-determined time.  This time will be different for each retail store based on the time of the mail and package pick-up.  In addition, the device must have a manual override capability so that the calendar date can be manually adjusted forward only.

3.3  Operational Overview

The following section provides an overview of current operations and the operating environment.

3.3.1  Current Operations – The CPUs that are supplied with the mailing systems are located in retail establishments throughout the United States and are operated by trained store personnel. Initial set up and training is supported by USPS retail specialists; however, the meter supplier is responsible for insuring that the initialization process is successful. Once in operation, daily sales are collected by the RAMM units and uploaded to the meter supplier after the CPU closes for the day. Sales data is consolidated by the meter supplier and reported, broken out by Category Code, to the Postal Service via the National Meter Accounting and Tracking System (NMATS) on a daily basis.  In addition the meter supplier will furnish to Postal HQ Retail reports showing shipping status, meters not reset, and historical status indicating when meters have been exchanged with a CPU.

3.3.2  Operating Environment – CPUs are generally housed within climate controlled retail establishments; however, PEDs and associated consumables must be capable of operating reliably and being stored in non-humidity controlled environments.

3.4  Pricing

The meter supplier should submit already published price list for meters they deem able to meet the requirements as described above.

4.  Contact Information

Responses must include the meter supplier representative’s name(s), title, business phone, fax, email and mailing address.  Meter suppliers should submit 6 copies of their response package to this RFI, by Wednesday, May 3, 2006, to the following address:

Potential IO concepts include network warfare operations, electronic warfare operations, influence operations, and supporting/enabling technologies such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), information assurance (IA), system and network management, and information dissemination management.
(2) This BAA solicits IPv6 related concept papers with the potential to enhance Air Force and DoD information operations.  Such concepts might include IPv6 capable tools and systems used for network defense or information assurance.  However, any concept involving IPv6 networks and any IO activity or topic, are of interest to the Air Force and will be considered for funding.
(3)  Security Requirements: The submittal process under this BAA is intended to be as streamlined as possible in order to allow the government to leverage the latest technology advances.  However, every precaution must be taken to protect potentially sensitive or classified material.  Such material should not be transmitted across open-source media like public phone, fax, Internet, or e-mail.  If a submitter has any reason to believe their concept may reference ideas or operations that require special protection, the submitter should immediately contact the Battlelab at (210) 977-3030.  In general, potentially sensitive submissions should be sent via REGISTERED MAIL to the mailing address listed in Section A of this BAA, or via e-mail to the one or both of the following secure e-mail addresses depending on the classification of the sensitive information: 

         SIPRNet: IWInnovation@iwcmx1.afiwc.aia.kelly.af.smil.mil 
         Or 
         JWICS:     IWInnovation@iswanmail.iswan.aia.ic.gov.     

Submitters who are supported by an accredited security office may be bound by specific laws and regulations directing the proper methods for transmission of classified concepts.
(4)  Other Special Requirements:
(a)  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. ONLY CONCEPT PAPERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED. 
(b)  Successful offerors must comply with the Privacy Act, AFI 37-132. 
(c)  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the government to an award under this BAA. 

C.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

(1)  Offerors are requested, if they have one, to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number.     
(2)  Non-government advisors will be used in the evaluation of concept papers and proposals.  MITRE Corporation, a non-profit Massachusetts company which operates a Federally Funded Research and Development Center for the Department of Defense, will assist the Government in the evaluation of concepts and proposals.  Concurrent Technologies Corp. (CTC), bdSystems, Inc., SeiCorp, Inc. and Scitor Corporation will assist the Government in the Battlelab process.  Also, the AFIOB employs a contractor as its security officer.  Non-Disclosure Agreements have been signed by MITRE, CTC, bdSystems Inc., Scitor Corporation, SeiCorp, Inc. and the Battlelab security contractor.     
(3)  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply. 
(4)  Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Air Force point of contact at AFIWBContracts@lackland.af.mil upon deciding to respond to this announcement.   Foreign contractors shall be aware that restrictions may apply which could preclude their participation in this acquisition. 

D.  CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 
(1)  The cost of preparing concept papers in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.     
(2)  Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the concept paper and any evaluations. The submitter must mark the concept paper with a protective legend IAW FAR 52.215-1(e).

<DESC>The Agency of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA), through the General Acquisitions Branch (GAB), Program Support Center (PSC), intends to award a 12  month sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Update Software Summertown Pavilion, Middle Way, Oxford, OX2 7LG United Kingdom.   The anticipated date of award is 5/08//2006.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is committed to advancing a Science to Service Initiative.  The initiative reflects a systematic agency-wide effort to facilitate implementation of effective, evidence-based interventions to prevent and/or treat mental and addictive disorders, and to promote opportunities and feedback from the services communities to influence and frame future mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment research.  As part of this initiative, SAMHSA seeks to develop a range of tools that will facilitate evidence-based decision-making among individuals and organizations responsible for preventing and/or treating mental and substance use disorders.  One important tool - and the purpose of this contract - is the development of effectiveness summaries of evidence-based research in mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment that are practical, clinically relevant and accessible to agency stakeholders.

The contractor shall be responsible for but not limited to the following tasks:
The Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities.  

Initial and Subsequent Conference Calls with PO
Within 1 week of contract award, the contractor shall participate in a conference call meeting with the Project Officer (PO) and other relevant SAMHSA staff to discuss the requirements and deliverables of the contract.  Prior to this conference call, the PO shall provide background materials and other relevant documents on SAMHSA’s Science to Service Initiative, the new NREPP system, and related activities.  Within one week of the conference call, the contractor shall produce a brief (e.g., 3-5 pages) memorandum outlining activities and action steps that will result in the development of a set of effectiveness summaries of evidence-based behavioral health interventions.  The contractor shall also participate in biweekly conference calls with the PO to discuss the status of project activities, and resolve any outstanding	issues.

Identification of Technical Advisory Panel (TAP) and Convening of TAP Meeting
Within three weeks of contract award, the contractor shall identify potential candidates to participate in a technical advisory panel (TAP) that will provide technical suggestions and feedback to the PO on the proposed contract deliverables.  Upon PO review and approval of the candidate list, the contractor shall contact and secure the participation of approved candidates.  Within ten weeks of contract award, the contractor shall convene TAP members for a two-day in-person meeting in the Washington D.C. area (most likely at SAMHSA headquarters),
to review and discuss proposed contract deliverables.  Within two weeks of the TAP meeting, Update Software shall provide the PO with a brief (e.g., 3-5 pages) memorandum outlining activities and action steps emerging from the TAP meeting.

For budget purposes, the contractor should understand that they will not be responsible for travel, lodging, and honorarium expenses for TAP members participating in the meeting,
and that this will be covered under a separate and existing SAMHSA logistics contract.  However, the contractor should also understand that they will be responsible for the travel of
their own staff to participate in this meeting

Develop Taxonomies and Identify Search Strategies for Review by the TAP
Within seven weeks of contract award, shall develop a series of taxonomies (e.g., type of disorder, type of service setting, etc.) that will be used in categorizing contract deliverables.  In addition, the contractor shall also identify a range/continuum of electronic	search strategies to capture relevant systematic reviews and other evidence-based research.  The taxonomies and search strategies shall be presented to and discussed with the PO at least two weeks prior to the TAP meeting.  Subsequent to this discussion, the taxonomies and search strategies shall be distributed to the TAP members at least one week prior to the TAP meeting.

Monitor and Oversee Production of Draft Effectiveness Summaries
Within 36 weeks of contract award, and based upon the materials and decisions emerging from Tasks 2 and 3, the contractor shall monitor and oversee the production of draft effectiveness
summaries of evidence-based behavioral health interventions to prevent and/or treat mental and substance use disorders.  The behavioral health interventions that are the topic of the draft
effectiveness summaries shall be classified for effectiveness based upon the strength of the existing and reviewed evidence.  For budget purposes, the contractor should anticipate production of approximately 400 effectiveness summaries.

Management and Quality Control of Final Effectiveness Summaries
Within 44 weeks of contract award, and after review by expert consensus panels, the contractor shall produce and the final versions of the effectiveness summaries developed under Task 4.

Within 52 weeks of contract award, the contractor provide appropriate electronic responses to any questions that pertain to either the content of the effectiveness summaries, or the process that the contractor utilized to produce the effectiveness summaries.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source Under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

For further information, and technical evaluation criteria, please contact Nora Tyson in Rm. 5C-03, Parklawn building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857 or on 301-443-5229.

Description of efforts made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many sources as practicable: The weapons requested are what the agents were trained to use during their initial training as Diplomatic security Service Special Agent Training. The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the retraining of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons systems to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad. Sig Sauer is the manufacturer of the P229 Pistol. A description of the market research conducted and the results or statement of reasons a market research was not conducted: The DS Firearms Policy and Review Board (FPRB) has approved the use of the Sig Sauer as the ONLY pistol authorized for use by DS Agents. Therefore, no market research was done. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: The weapons system described above are to be utilized by the agents assigned to Domestic and overseas posts. The vendor states that the lead time on these items is 45-60 days from the date of order and no other source could provide them in such a timely manner, these items are needed as soon as possible, so it is imperative that this be treated as circumstances permitting other than full and open competition. DS has verified that the request as described represents the government?s minimum requirements.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories(RML), is in need of a ERGO license renewal.  RML has sequenced several pathogen genomes.  Determining the chemical sequence of the DNA of the pathogenic organisms is a critical first step in the development of diagnostics, vaccines and chemotherapeutics against deadly human pathogens.  A critical aspect of sequencing and processing of the data from multiple bacterial genomes is the use of servers and bioinformatics software to store, analyze and present genome data.  The RML currently has an  ERGO server on site for the processing, storing and presentation of bacterial pathogen genome data.  This RML ERGO server and the software that runs on it needs to be covered by a service and support contract to supply unlimited phone and email support, quarterly data updates, an ERGO gene expression module and a genomic data supplement.  The contractor shall provide to RML a 1(one) year License Renewal, including 4(four) quarterly data updates of existing genomic data, all new public genome data added to the ERGO database throughout the year, and proprietary customer data from any sequencing and annotation projects performed with Integrated Genomics.

Contractor supplied software shall be kept current and up to date with applicable security patches and upgrades.  Internet connectivity and/or remote access for the purpose of performing the work, for transfer of files, or other efforts, will be coordinated with NIAID IT staff to ensure security and compliance with NIAID IT procedures and policies.

The Contractor shall produce/provide the following deliverables: l) Unlimited phone and email support for the RML ERGO server and software for one(1) year.  2) 4(four) quarterly ERGO database upgrades for genomic data in the public domain, genomes already present on the RML ERGO server, and all genomes performed at RML. The first quarterly updates shall be scheduled immediately upon receipt of the licensing fees and Rocky Mountain Laboratories shipping information.  Subsequent updates will be delivered at approximately 60(sixty) business day intervals following the first update. This upgrade for all publicly available genomes shall be completely compatible with the infrastructure and format of the RML ERGO server.  Cross genome comparative analysis must be available, prediction of translation starts, sequence similarities, functional annotation, and orthologous cluster analysis.  Additional methods that rely on gene context rather than on sequence similarity must also used for annotation of those genomes. 3)ERGO gene expression module for integration of micro array data (spotted and Affymetrix chip data) into gene function and context pathways.

<DESC>1.1  SCOPE.  The purpose of this Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is to obtain Contractor recruiting and technical services in support of the United States Coast Guard’s Minority Serving Institution Internship Program (MSIIP) for the Office of Civilian Personnel (CG-121).  Task orders requirements under this IDIQ shall include program facilitation and coordination, recruiting, application evaluation and processing, developing a database, tracking and entering data, disability support services, training, event planning, and travel and housing coordination.  Task Orders under this contract are expected to be performance based.

1.2  BACKGROUND. The United States Coast Guard MSIIP promotes entry into Coast Guard mission careers of women, persons with disabilities, and members of diverse groups, where those groups are under-represented in the industry.  The United States Coast Guard MSIIP provides current college students experience working with the Coast Guard while engaged in Coast Guard mission related work projects, special assignments, or research.
The MSIIP offers internship opportunities during the spring, summer and/or fall for students from Historically Black College and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Asian American and Pacific Islanders and the disability communities.  Historically, the Coast Guard has selected interns in the summer and fall only.  However, the spring session is 15 weeks long running from January to May.  The summer session is 10 weeks long running from June to August and the fall session is 15 weeks long running from August to December. The program also provides hands on understanding of Coast Guard mission careers while working full-time (40 hrs/week), on-site, at the United States Coast Guard Headquarters or a field unit facility.  The objectives of the United States Coast Guard MSIIP are to:
(1)	Attract diverse groups of individuals to Homeland Security related careers.
(2)	Enable college students to supplement their academic course work with study-related work experiences in United States Coast Guard offices/facilities in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and the Coast Guard’s regional and field units throughout the United States and its territories.
(3)	Support the goals and objectives of the following Executive Orders (EOs) (as amended) and Coast Guard’s Human Resource Directorate (CG-1) MSIIP initiatives with regard to educational enrichment and outreach activities:
•	E.O. 13230, “President’s Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans;”
•	E.O. 13270, “Tribal Colleges and Universities;”
•	E.O. 13256, “President’s Advisory Board on Historically Black Colleges and Universities;”
•	E.O. 13216, “Increasing Opportunity and Improving Quality of Life of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders;” and,
•	E.O. 13078, “Increasing Employment of Adults with Disabilities.”
The EOs also provide the necessary framework for United States Coast Guard to provide, through the Coast Guard MSIIP, requests for Minority Serving Institution (MSI) students from Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and other institutions of higher education serving students with disabilities and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
(4)	Develop and sharpen students’ skills to conduct limited research, complete written reports, and make presentations.
Students intern in a variety of fields including, but not limited to: engineering, human resources, communications, business/finance, electronics, computer science, law/law enforcement, and other mission-related occupations in the Coast Guard.  Student skills, knowledge, and abilities will generally be matched with their career interests and academic field of study.
Coast Guard Offices, field units and commands provide interns with study-related work experiences.  The Contractor coordinathe placement of the students.
The program includes discussions of Homeland Security issues with Coast Guard officials, guidance from Coast Guard supervisors, and workshops/seminars provided by the Contractor.  In some cases students have made prior arrangements to receive academic credit for their internship by writing a report and presenting a briefing to supervisors and peers at the end of their internship.   The program includes a nationwide focus, with central oversight by Coast Guard’s Human Resource Directorate via the COTR. The Coast Guard’s MSIIP typically has a maximum of 20 interns throughout the year across the United States including students in the USCG Headquarters and other units in Washington, D.C metro area.  Other internships will occur in Coast Guard field units across the United States and U.S. Territories. 
In the past, the student’s 40 hour work week included Coast Guard project assignments as well as attending seminars, training sessions, etc. Generally, all scheduled seminars, training sessions, etc., occurred during standard business hours. However, these activities have occasionally occurred immediately preceding, or immediately following standard business hours.

<DESC>1.1 SCOPE.  The purpose of this task order is to obtain Contractor recruiting and technical services in support of the United States Coast Guard’s Minority Serving Institution Internship Program (MSIIP) for the Office of Civilian Personnel (CG-121).  Contractor support shall include program facilitation and coordination, recruiting, application evaluation and processing, developing a database, tracking and entering data, disability support services, training, event planning, and travel and housing coordination.

1.2 BACKGROUND.  The United States Coast Guard MSIIP promotes entry into Coast Guard mission careers of women, persons with disabilities, and members of diverse groups, where those groups are under-represented in the industry.  The United States Coast Guard MSIIP provides current college students experience working with the Coast Guard while engaged in Coast Guard mission related work projects, special assignments, or research.
The MSIIP offers internship opportunities during the spring, summer and/or fall for students from Historically Black College and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Asian American and Pacific Islanders and the disability communities.  Historically, the Coast Guard has selected interns in the summer and fall only.  However, the spring session is 15 weeks long running from January to May.  The summer session is 10 weeks long running from June to August and the fall session is 15 weeks long running from August to December. The program also provides hands on understanding of Coast Guard mission careers while working full-time (40 hrs/week), on-site, at the United States Coast Guard Headquarters or a field unit facility.  The objectives of the United States Coast Guard MSIIP are to:
(1)	Attract diverse groups of individuals to Homeland Security related careers. (2) Enable college students to supplement their academic course work with study-related work experiences in United States Coast Guard offices/facilities in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and the Coast Guard’s regional and field units throughout the United States and its territories. (3) Support the goals and objectives of the following Executive Orders (EOs) (as amended) and Coast Guard’s Human Resource Directorate (CG-1) MSIIP initiatives with regard to educational enrichment and outreach activities:
•	E.O. 13230, “President’s Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans:”
•	E.O. 13270, “Tribal Colleges and Universities;”
•	E.O. 13256, “President’s Advisory Board on Historically Black Colleges and Universities;”
•	E.O. 13216, “Increasing Opportunity and Improving Quality of Life of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders;” and,
•	E.O. 13078, “Increasing Employment of Adults with Disabilities.”
The E.O.s also provide the necessary framework for United States Coast Guard to provide, through the Coast Guard MSIIP, requests for Minority Serving Institution (MSI) students from Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and other institutions of higher education serving students with disabilities and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
(4) Develop and sharpen students’ skills to conduct limited research, complete written reports, and make presentations.

Students intern in a variety of fields including, but not limited to: engineering, human resources, communications, business/finance, electronics, computer science, law/law enforcement, and other mission-related occupations in the Coast Guard.  Student skills, knowledge, and abilities will generally be matched with their career interests and academic field of study.
Coast Guard Offices, field units and commands provide interns with study-related work experiences.  The Contractor coordinates with the Coast Guard’s Human Resource Directorate (CG-1) via the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to coordinate  not U.S.-made or designated country end products.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION IS ISSUED TO THE ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS. The original synopsis is also reprinted below.
The following amendment is published to the Combined Solicitation No. R1015991:

Questions and Responses:

1.	The technical evaluation factors listed seem to address deliverables, rather than qualifications. How will a contractor be selected? The evaluation factors for this procurement have been revised as set forth in this amendment.
2.	Should enteral feeding pumps be included in the response? Enteral feeding pumps are not part of this requirement.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD are revised to read as follows: 
(1)	Offeror’s ability to analyze the market share per unit sold by manufacturer and pump type (competitor analysis)
(2)	Offeror’s ability to analyze the manufacturing capacity of each manufacturer
(3)	Offeror’s ability to analyze the distribution networks in place for the dissemination of these pumps into the health care system
(4)	Offeror’s ability to analyze manufacturer throughput time.
(5)	MANDATORY REQUIREMENT – The offeror must be able to deliver the Competitor Analysis 3 weeks after this procurement is awarded.
(6)	Price

Offerors in response to this announcement shall address each criterion narratively in detail in their response to this announcement. The technical criteria, items 1 through 5 when combined, are more important than factor (6) price. Quotes will be evaluated on the basis of the technical factors above and price and award will be based on the best value to the government. The Government intends to award one firm-fixed price purchase order resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible, responsive, technically acceptable offeror whose quotation conforming to this combined synopsis/solicitation, will offer the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The due date for receipt of quotes remains unchanged, 4/25/2006. Proposals/Quotes shall be submitted electronically to Elizabeth.Osinski@fda.hhs.gov and Alice.Pagan@oc.fda.gov 






ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is R1015991 and is issued as a Request for Quotations. The Government plans to award a purchase order for the analysis of the infusion pump market. The Statement of work is as follows:

1. Analysis of Leading Competitors 
The offeror must compile total market values and market shares by unit sales for each segment of the infusion pump market. Segments to be analyzed include: 
	• Insulin Pumps 
	• Implantable Pumps 
	• Electronic Ambulatory Pumps 
	• Disposable Ambulatory Pumps 
	• Volumetric Pumps 
	• PCA Volumetric Pumps 
	• Syringe Pumps 
	
2. The offeror must present a text-based deliverable including unit shares as well as unit share analysis for each segment, as well as for the market as a whole. Analysis will be based on primary and secondary research and will include quantitative depictions of 2005 unit shares in graphical and tabular format accompanied by qualitative analysis. 

3. In-Depth Manufacturing and Distribution Analysis 
Following the delivery of Part A, the offeror must have the ability to delve into the dynamics of the manufacturing and distribution arrangements in the infusion pump market. This analysis will focus on determining all competitors in the US infusion pump market and, in particular, the top 12 manufacturers by overall unit share. 
For each competitor the offeror will determine: 

•	The manufacturing capacity of that manufacturer 
•	Distribution networks in place for the dissemination of these pumps into the health care system 
•	Manufacturer throughput time 
•	Manufacturing and Distribution Analysis needed 8 weeks after this simplified acquisition is awarded


	4.The offeror must amalgamate the initial unit share information into a final text-based report. This report needs to be segmented by competitor. A similar analysis is needed for each competitor. In addition, these analyses must be prefaced by an overview chapter, comparing manufacturers. 


Quarterly Tracking 

The offeror must also offer the option to repeat this research on a quarterly basis. In this case, the FDA will need 2 quarterly deliverable tracking changes in unit shares and distribution agreements. 

The following quarterly results will be delivered. 
	• May 31, 2006 
	o Current Manufacturing Capacity, as of April 1, 2006 
	o Current Distribution Network, as of April 1, 2006 
	o Manufacturer Throughput Time, as of April 1, 2006 
	• August 31, 2006 
	o Current Manufacturing Capacity, as of July 1, 2006 
	o Current Distribution Network, as of July 1, 2006 
	o Manufacturer Throughput Time, as of July 1, 2006 
 
Technical Evaluation Criteria are listed below for the infusion pump market. (Insulin Pumps, Implantable Pumps, Electronic Ambulatory Pumps, Disposable Ambulatory Pumps, Volumetric Pumps, PCA Volumetric Pumps and Syringe Pumps) 

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA

<DESC>THIS AMENDMENT INCORPORATES CHANGES TO THE STATEMENT OF WORK/ SPECIFICATIONS AND EXTENDS THE DUE DATE UNTIL APRIL 27, 2006. ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REAMAIN UNCHANGED.

THE FOLLOWING CHANGES ARE INCORPORATED:

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES IN “SOW_scattered_beam_PG_filter_v2c_AMD-1 CB.doc” 

Overall description of changes: 
The requirement on mosaic has been tightened from 15 degrees as measured with 11.6 meV neutrons to 7 degrees for 14.7 meV neutrons
The minimum transmission requirement has been changed from 80 percent at 11.6 meV to 65 percent at 14.7 meV. Because of the specific nature of neutron transmission through graphite both of these changes imply stricter requirements on the materials quality. 
 
Specific edits: 
Page 1 line 3

The requirement for new or remanufactured machines is eliminated. The vendor is required to provide a fully operational piece of equipment and to maintain it during the rental period.

Minimum number of copies on Band I machines is increased to 8000 per week.  CLIN 0001A Band I is increased to 8000 copies per week.  CLIN 0003A cost per copy over minimum for Band I is increased to any copies over 8000 per week. Deadline for bids is extended to Monday, 24 April 2006 at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time.
