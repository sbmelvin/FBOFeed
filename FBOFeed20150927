b.  Non-server systems will employ Microsoft Windows 8.1 or higher, and provide the capability of transitioning to Windows 10 once it is released. 
c.  The MCS, VoIP, and SSS hardware replacements must be rack-mountable units, to conserve space. 
d.  The ICS hardware replacement will be a mini-tower computer system.
 
e.  The originally delivered custom TMS software applications for each subsystem will be integrated for compatibility with the applicable new operating system, while maintaining its original functionality.	
f.  Replace forty-five (45) Hand-Held Evaluation Tool (HHET) hardware and commercial software, to a configuration that will ensure vendor supportability 
for a minimum of five (5) years beyond procurement. The replacement HHET should retain current functionality, comply with current DoD Information

The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects. The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'. Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(a) Definition. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>BACKGROUND <br />The Northwestern Region, Portland District, USACE plans on issuing an unrestricted (full and open competition) Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) Construction Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) solicitation for installation of Government-furnished equipment (GFE) digital governor projects for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Portland District (NWP) and Walla Walla (NWW) Districts. <br /><br />The Construction MATOC will have a base period of performance (POP) three years and one (1) (two year) option period and a maximum guarantee of $2,000 over the life of the contract. The option period may be exercised at the discretion of the Government before expiration of the base POP. <br /><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION <br />The requirements include the installation of GFE digital governors, manufactured by American Governors, to upgrade/replace and retrofit existing analog and electro-mechanical governors for up to 24 existing governors for hydroelectric units at eight (8) powerhouses within the geographic boundaries of both NWP and NWW Districts. The mechanical work includes disassembly, inspection, and refurbishment of the governor distributing valves for Kaplan or Francis turbine gates and blades. The work consists of installation of retrofit kits, inspection of existing distributing valves, possibly refurbish or replace existing distributing valves, and furnish and install ancillary equipment to make a complete digital governor upgrade installation. <br /><br />The governors at each dam are unique, but in general use a hydraulic system to actuate the wicket gates and blade angle to control the speed and power output of the hydroelectric governors. The work to be completed also includes the Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) manuals, as-built drawings, and warranty items. <br /><br />LOCATION <br />See the attached table reflecting anticipated projects for each District that is slated to be awarded under this MATOC. The work for the NWP and NWW USACE Districts are located in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho States (Dworshak is located in Clearwater County, Idaho). <br /><br />ELECTRICAL <br />Significant required work: removal and installation of switchboard devices, Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) cabinet wiring, Category 6 Cable (CAT 6) Ethernet wiring and switches, installation and calibration of analog transmitters and zero velocity sensors, furnishing and installing: rigid and liquid tight flexible steel conduit, control wire and cable, relays, meters, etc. This effort includes the installation of human machine interface(s), PLC control cabinets, networking equipment, and related Human Machine Interface (HMI) in the control room switchboard, the establishment of a communications network between the new digital governors and the Human Machine Interface (HMI), and related ancillary work. Electrical work may also include furnishing and installing fiber optic cable, terminations, Optical Time-Domain Reflectometer (ODTR) Testing and inner duct; and enclosures. <br /><br />Work includes using typical schematic and wiring diagrams provided by the Government to produce detailed point-to-point Computer-Aided Design (CAD) wiring diagrams showing the wiring installation for each governor installation at a location. <br /><br />MECHANICAL <br />Mechanical work includes: providing detailed CAD part, assembly, and installation drawings of the various mechanical and structural elements, performing distributing valve and head inspections and preparing repair/rebuild plans; performing distributing valve and head repairs, removing existing cables, pulleys, and hydraulic components (tubing, hoses, and valves), designing, fabricating, furnishing and installing hydraulic routing and components including seals, tubing, hoses, fittings, filters, and valves (manual and electro-hydraulic) in systems of up to 1,000 pounds per square inch (PSI) operating pressure; designing, fabricating and installing bracket assemblies for blade and gate position transducers, painting of governor cabinets and components, modification of metal governor cabinets, and design, fabrication and installation of additional cabinets to house items such as HMI. <br /><br />Distributing valve inspections include providing a detailed report with measurements to the nearest 0.0001 inch. Outside Diameter (OD), Inside Diameter (ID), Total Indicated Runout (TIR), Parallelism, perpendicularity, flatness, and concentricity measurements shall be taken of the valve components and assemblies, including the distributing valve plunger (spool), distributing valve bushing, servomotor plunger (pilot piston) and mating surface ID, and plunger rod (stem). <br /><br />Distributing valve repair/rebuild can include refurbishment or replacement of the relay valve spools, bushings, pilot pistons, seals, and/or controllers. A qualified machine shop having experience in manufacturing equipment in similar size and equal or tighter tolerances as Pelton/Woodward governor relay valve original manufacturer dimensions and tolerances shall be used for the repair/rebuild work. Blade and Gate Distributing Valve Head Repairs to the valve head and mating parts could require the Contractor to perform all necessary repairs to the relay valve end cap and mating parts to maintain alignment of the relay valve assembly, which involves the bore of the pilot piston seal of the relay valve head to the bushing bore to face a concentricity and perpendicularity to the mounting fact of 0.0003 inch of less. <br /><br />SEED TASK ORDER <br />All contractors determined to be technically acceptable shall be evaluated against their proposed FFP price proposed for the Seed Task Order. There will be one (1) Seed Task Order for two (2) dams (Detroit and Big Cliff Powerhouse located in Marion County, Oregon) located close to each other and will be for the digital government replacement PLCs, HMI equipment, and digital front-end equipment are GFE (will be provided at each unit for local control). <br /><br />The Magnitude of Construction is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238210 (Electrical and Other Wiring Installation Contractors) and the small business size standard of $15 Million. <br /><br />PROCUREMENT METHOD <br />This is an Unrestricted Acquisition using lowest-priced technically acceptable basis for award. The Government's objective is to award up to three (3) IDIQ MATOC resulting from this solicitation. The shared MATOC capacity is $11 Million. <br /><br />The Point of Contact (POC) for small business questions or assistance is the Portland District Deputy for Small Business, Carol McIntyre at phone number 503-808-4602 or carol.a.mcintyre@usace.army.mil. <br /><br />TIMELINE <br />The formal Request for Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be issued on or about February 18, 2015 and will be an attachment to this announcement.
