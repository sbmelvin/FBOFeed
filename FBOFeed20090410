<DESC><p>17. Reference item number 10; Closing Response date is as stated above or 30 days after release of the solicitation which ever is later. Reference previous sources sought synopsis dated Dec 2007, May 2008 and pre-solicitation notice dated 10 Feb 2009. This office intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8900-09-R-0002 for the 711 Human Performance Wing (HPW) Mission Support Services sometime in May 2009. The 711 HPW is a geographically dispersed Wing headquartered at Wright-Patterson AFB (WPAFB), Ohio, with a significant mission operating the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) at Brooks City-Base (BCB), Texas. The unit is mandated under the Base Realignment and Closure law to complete its mission transfer from BCB to WPAFB by the end of FY11; under a reorganization accomplished in FY08, the USAFSAM absorbed all the responsibilities of the Air Force Institute for Operational Health (AFIOH). The merger of AFIOH into USAFSAM resulted in a diverse portfolio of large and small business contracts, many of short duration and/or due to expire. All the requirements capable of being accomplished by 8(a) small business companies have been consolidated under this 8a set-aside procurement. This 8(a) set-aside will result in multiple (3 or more) indefinite delivery, indefinite-quantity contract awards. This acquisition will provide a full range of Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS), Non-A&amp;AS, and Personal Services to the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine in its acquisition of medical, clinical, biological sciences support for the HPW. Specific requirements will be met by issuing task orders under the basic contracts. The contract types for these task orders are expected to be performed via Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) and Time and Materials. The ordering period for the basic contracts will be five years and the total ceiling amount for all basic contracts will be $93 million. For the contract duration, the minimum guarantee amount shall be $55,000. This minimum guarantee shall be met by obligating $55,000.00 or more via the first task order. Task Order 0001 will be issued concurrently with the basic contract award and is not included in the basic contract proposal costs. The RFPs associated with the first task orders will be issued along with the notice of awards. Those services considered most critical to mission success are as follows: <br />Information Technology personnel <br />Biomedical Laboratory Technicians<br />Molecular Biologists Medical Specialists <br />Ophthalmologists Psychologists<br />Physicians <br />Neurologists<br />Toxicologists Cardiologists
<p>Anticipated award date for the basic ID/IQ contracts is 18December 2009. Until such time, contacts or briefings by participating offerors concerning this acquisition will not be allowed outside the formal source selection process. The Contracting Officer (C) shall control all contact or exchanges with offerors and is the only person authorized to release information before and after contract award. Therefore, all communications regarding this competitive 8a Set-Aside acquisition shall be through the Contracting Officer only.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Draft RFP Section L, page 5, Paragraph 2.1.3 Discrepancies, "if and Offeror believes that the requirements in these instructions contain an error, omission, or are otherwise unsound, the Offeror shall submit questions/concerns to the Contracting Office with supporting rationale immediately, but no later than 10 calendar days after release of the RFP. Note: if any potential offeror has any questions/concerns regarding the current Draft RFP documentation, please submit it as soon as possible but no later 17 April 2009 to the Contracting Officer.

Offeror references can use this time to complete their associated Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ). Failure to submit early PPIs will not necessarily result in Offeror disqualification.</p>

This request should be accomplished immediately upon receipt of the RFP but no later than 15 calendar days after release of the RFP.

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to establish a collaborative project with qualified organization(s) to develop and perform predictive in vitro dissolution/release test methods.  

The purpose of this contract is to establish a collaborative project with qualified organization(s) to develop and perform predictive in vitro dissolution/release test methods that can be applicable for poorly soluble drugs, and guide in vitro and in vivo studies conducted for APIs with similar solubility characteristics under typical (standard) conditions and under “altered” conditions reflecting unique patient characteristics. 

The developed dissolution/release testing paradigms, incorporating drug product and dosage form characteristics for oral dosage forms, should be reliable, transferable to similar products, and clinically meaningful (predictive) throughout the lifecycle of the product. 

Furthermore, while addressing existing concerns, the approaches explored will bring in new knowledge, and it is intended that the findings from this project (with necessary extensions), will lead to in vitro dissolution/release testing paradigms for a large group of drug products. 

The work under this contract involves preparation of a study protocol that will describe the rationale in selection of the study drugs (will be referred to as model drugs), methods (such as methods used for data collection and possible additional exploratory approaches, data storage and data analyses) and reporting and communication of results.  The subsections of the study protocol and the required information are described as follows.

<DESC>RECOVERY – THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE PROCURED ON A NON-COMPETITIVE BASIS UNDER AN EXISTING INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY CONTRACT FOR PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE NIST CENTER FOR NEUTRON RESEARCH (NCNR).  

This Pre-Solicitation Notice is hereby issued in accordance with the guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  This project is subject to the availability of funds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds.

Develop and Deliver a Detailed Design for the Plumbing System for the Thermal Shield Cooling System, Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD.

Description of Services
The NIST Reactor (NBSR) is equipped with a thermal shield.  This radiation shield consists of steel and lead that has to be water cooled in order to be kept at a temperature where it does not change shape under its own weight.  Over the many years of usage the thermal shield plumbing has developed tiny leaks, which are impossible to repair. 

Work required under this task order will develop and deliver a detailed design for the upgrade of the plumbing system.  

The upgrade requires that cooling water be administered by moving it through the shield using a vacuum rather than a positive pump pressure, as in the present mechanical configuration.

Work under this task order is follow-on work to a task order awarded competitively in July of 2008 and completed in October 2008.  Work under that task order developed a concept design to upgrade the thermal shield cooling system.

<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) entitled “Mechanisms of Behavior Change Initiation (MOBCI) for Drinking Behavior.”  NIAAA is soliciting proposals for new, high risk approaches to traditionally intractable alcohol-related problems through the development of mechanism-based strategies that induce maladaptive drinkers to initiate and sustain a change from maladaptive drinking behaviors towards more healthful drinking behaviors.  NIAAA is looking for opportunities that will result in entirely new or quantum improvements in both the theory and methodologies used to understand how to induce sustainable, positive change in maladaptive drinkers.  Although the long-term goal of this initiative is to develop strategies for sustained, positive drinking behavior change, this BAA focuses on the initiation of change as an initial step towards this goal.  However, if suitably justified, this BAA does not discourage proposals that incorporate theory and approaches that look at both initiation and maintenance of positive drinking behavior change.

This BAA is soliciting proposals for two types of projects, denoted by Category A: MOBCI Research Projects and Category B: MOBCI Coordinating Center. 

 Category A: MOBCI Research Projects.  The present BAA is soliciting proposals for innovative, foundational, systems-oriented research aimed at diagnostically relevant, quantitative, mechanism-based, dynamical models of drinking behavior. The purpose of this BAA is to inform the design of strategies to cause initiation of sustainable, positive drinking behavior change.  Of particular interest is breakthrough research that uncovers and explicates the mechanisms and associated “controllable variables” underlying such change, at the following three levels of observation and analysis: 
•           Neurophysiologic factors: individual neurophysiology and relevant biology,
•           Intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive, psychological, affective and behavioral) factors, and 
•           Immediate interpersonal factors: individual immediate social ecology (e.g., family, friends).

Multi-level, multi-scale mechanisms are an emphasis area for this BAA.

Category B: MOBCI Coordinating Center.  In order to accomplish MOBCI’s goals, NIAAA expects that there will be a need to support the incorporation and use of advanced analytic and modeling methods among Category A projects.  The transdisciplinary integration of existing and new databases is of particular note in this context.  NIAAA seeks to actively foster collaboration and sharing of approaches and data sources in order to enhance both the immediate success of all participants and the long-term contributions of MOBCI.  Hence, Category B calls for proposals that would provide significant collaboration, archival, integration, and analysis services for the Category A projects. 

NIAAA anticipates awarding multiple contracts based on technical merit, availability of funds, and programmatic balance.  NOTE:  In contracts awarded as a result of this BAA, the Statement of Work will be proposed by the offeror and negotiated and accepted by the Government.

<a href="mailto:growney.matthew@epa.gov">MATTHEW J. GROWNEY</a>
<DESC>The EPA has a requirement for a contractor to provide the Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) with support for its research efforts in the detection and decontamination of chemical, biological, or radiological (CBR) contamination that may be intentionally introduced into drinking water distribution systems, ambient (indoor and outdoor) air, buildings and other surfaces.  The EPA is seeking a contractor to establish and implement a mechanism for testing, evaluating, and reporting on the performance of homeland security related technologies for addressing CBR warfare agents.
Specific homeland security related technologies include the following: (1) Decontamination/surface cleaning (indoor and outdoor surfaces) of large buildings, structures, and other surfaces; (2) Analytical techniques for continuous measurement of fumigant chemicals; (3) Decontamination of drinking water distribution systems and wastewater treatment plants; (4) Water quality monitoring and detection; (5) Ambient air quality monitoring and detection; (6) Air cleaning methodologies for use in buildings and other structures; (7) CBR sampling methods - including water, air, soil, and from surfaces; (8) Point-of-use and point-of-entry drinking water treatment technologies; (9) Treatment of wastewater generated during decontamination; (10) Computer software programs for use in designing water system or building monitoring networks; (11) Personal protective equipment.
The contractor shall expect that pilot scale testing will be required for testing of sample cases.  Full-scale, large-item testing may be required for a more realistic evaluation of technologies using certain CBR agents, surrogates, or both.  It may also be necessary to conduct testing using real chemical and biological warfare agents; therefore, the contractor shall have the capabilities, expertise, and a Biosafety Level 3 facility for handling pathogenic organisms.  The contractor must also have an active chemical surety laboratory and a bailment agreement with the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM).
Other aspects of this effort will include: (1) the development and management of stakeholder groups and subordinate technical panels; (2) establishing and maintaining a continuous project information dissemination and diffusion capability (outreach); and (3) developing standards that can be used by others to test and evaluate technologies.
The Government anticipates award of a cost plus fixed fee term (LOE) contract with a twelve-month base term and four (4) twelve month options to extend the term.  The base level of effort for each term will consist of 7,500 direct labor hours. The Government anticipates including quantity option amounts of 300% for the Base and the option periods, which brings the maximum total potential on the contract to 150,000 direct labor hours over five (5) years.  The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis; it will not be a small business set-aside. Copies of the solicitation will be available to all offerors on the Internet at the following website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. 
Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the website and to monitor the status of the RFP. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA. The anticipated solicitation release date is mid May and the close date shall be approximately 30 days thereafter. Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The NAICS code is 541712, (research and development in the physical, engineering, and life sciences [except biotechnology] with a size standard of 500 persons.  The point of contact for this procurement is Matthew J. Growney at 513-487-2029.  See Note 26.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), Explosives Division (EXD), has been tasked to conduct operational field demonstrations of remotely operated and standoff explosives countermeasure technologies to address the threat from suicide bombers, as well as leave-behind and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices.  DHS S&T’s Standoff Technology Integration and Demonstration Program (STIDP) is designed to accelerate the development of standoff and remotely operated explosives countermeasures architectures for detecting these threats. A countermeasure architecture comprises detection technologies and how they are deployed and operated; how they integrate with the venue’s operations; and technologies that enable the countermeasure to be operated as an integrated system (e.g., command, control, and communications; data management and recording). The ultimate goal of the program is to prevent explosives attacks in free-flowing crowds—such as those arriving for large public events and mass transit facilities —via an iterative approach of identifying technologies, integrating and testing them in crowd environments, and providing feedback for technology developers.

This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to identify interested parties or teams with experience in designing and implementing pedestrian control management techniques and methods, especially pertaining to the architectural design of the ingress environment at a large public event.  

The primary intent of this RFI is to explore innovative technologies or models of how to characterize existing pedestrian flows and successfully control crowd flows with a minimal investment in infrastructure at the farthest fringes of the sensor detection zones. The Government is also interested in crowd monitoring/control closer to the venue entrances for implementing technologies such as geo-tracking and video anomaly detection (e.g. entry to exclusion zones, leave-behind baggage, crowd formations and dispersion, etc.).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>RECOVERY.  The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for public construction and is soliciting written expressions of interest from qualified general contractors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the referenced project.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220.  The size standard is $33.5 million per year.  This is an unrestricted procurement open to all large and small business concerns.  

All firms shall submit a one page letter of interest on company letter head.  This letter shall include a statement of interest, number of personnel that will attend the Pre-proposal conference and a signed Document Security Certification (uploaded on FedBizOpps) with a copy of a valid business license.  Letters and certification are due to the office of the Contract Specialist no later than April 20, 2009.  Send documentation to the attention of Marsha Tyson, Contract Specialist, General Services Administration (GSA), (7PMA), Room 12B01, 819 Taylor St., Fort Worth, Texas 76102 or marsha.tyson@gsa.gov.  GSA retains the right to publish and distribute the list of offerors to other interested parties (i.e., subcontractors, etc.).  The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for the project is $40,000,000 to $50,000,000.   Funds allocated via www.recovery.gov reflect funds for the entire project and not just construction.  Contractors should price according to the construction specifications.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is scheduled to be issued on or about April 27, 2009 via FedTeds (https://www.fedteds.gov/).  Firms must send the letter of intent with the security certification to gain access to the documents.  A Site Visit and Pre-Proposal Conference is tentatively scheduled to be held May 6 - 7, 2009 in San Antonio, Texas to answer questions that offerors may have concerning the project, specifications, drawings and technical evaluation criteria.  Attendance at the Pre-proposal conference and site visit is not mandatory.  GSA intends to contract for complete construction services with the construction contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.  The project for this building will include replacing the HVAC system to improve energy efficiency, modernize the building electrical and fire protection systems, including the construction of a new exterior fire stair, construct new space finishes for several tenants prior to move-in, and alter interior spaces for existing tenants and renovate public spaces with focus on historic preservation, handicap access, and upgrades to the elevators and building security systems.  Additional project work will consist of extensive restroom plumbing, refurbishing of the limestone exterior, and re-roofing.


The project is designed to comply with a Certification Level according to the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED), Silver Level Rating System.  The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials, equipment and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract.  The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value/Trade-off process.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price.  The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire construction project including the administrative cost of processing change orders throughout the course of this project.  The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.202), based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government.  Any scope changes by the Government that result from the pre-proposal conference or any other discussions may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for price proposal submission at no recompense to the offeror(s).  The technical factors are tentatively as follows: (#1) Past Performance and Experience on Similar Historical Projects; (#2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel; and (#3) Detailed Management Plan and Technical Approach.  Proposals will be due on or about June 2, 2009.  All questions/clarifications regarding the project documents (drawings, specifications, procedures, etc.) shall be put in writing and submitted to the Contract Specialist no later than close of business May 18, 2009.  Production costs and proposal preparation costs are at the expense of the offeror.  

This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (FAR 52.219-19). This procurement is open to small and large business concerns.  Before award of the contract, the business concern (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507. Small, women-owned, service disabled veteran owned and small disadvantaged firms are strongly encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.  All interested large business firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with small and disadvantaged firms as indicated FAR 19.702.  The Subcontracting Goals established for this project are as follows:  Total Small Business 36%; Total Small Disadvantaged Business 8%; Woman Owned 5%; HUBZone Business 3%; and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 3%. 

All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the Solicitation Number GS-07P-09-HH-C-0063.  This project is being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009.  THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY THAT FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The University of Memphis, 115 Wilder Tower, Memphis TN  38152-0001 for the use of facilities, and adjoining support services at the University of Memphis, Center for Earthquake Research and Information, which includes:  Office Space and Utilities, use of secretarial, drafting and computer staff, graduate research assistant, network access and usage for computer equipment, miscellaneous copying charges, mail etc., dedicated fax line and monthly charges, and GIS services - Tech info specialist.
The U.S. Geological Survey has an ongoing requirement for implementing the Memorandum of Understanding executed in 1991 between the University of Memphis and the U.S. Geological Survey for earthquake research and hazard mitigation. USGS scientists and scientists at the University of Memphis work in conjunction at the University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI).  The CERI has a longstanding research program concerning the earthquake hazards in that seismically active part of the United States.  The space needs to be located on-site in order to perform collaborative research and collaborative outreach activities, conduct co-operative seismological studies, interpret seismic data, records and documentation archived at the University, and to be able to attend meetings and conferences held on campus, often with no prior notice.This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy the agency's requirement.  The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition:
The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) requires that the US Geological Survey (USGS), Department of the Interior, to emphasize earthquake hazards research and related activities in four geographic regions, one of which is the central US/New Madrid region.  The USGS NEHRP in the New Madrid region benefits from the scientific and technical investigations carried out by the University of Memphis by experts with special skills and experience in earthquake research and mitigation activities.  The presence of University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information (UM/CERI) with its longstanding active research programs in the New Madrid region, makes it necessary for the USGS to work cooperatively in order to strengthen the regional research effort to reduce earthquake hazards in this seismically active part of the United States.It is imperative that the USGS scientists are located on-site at the University in order to perform collaborative research, conduct cooperative seismological studies, interpret seismic data records and documentation archived at the University, and attend meetings and conferences held on campus often with no prior notice.Another location off-campus would inhibit scientific interaction with the UM scientists, reduce the effectiveness of important cooperative research activities with the University, and make more inaccessible the scientific and technical database required for USGS seismic research.
Firms that believe they can provide the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements.

Army Space and Missile Defense Command / Army Forces Strategic Command requires continuation of research and the development aimed at the advancement of technologies, increased mission flexibility, and improvements in performance of the Throttleable Divert and Attitude Control System under the Interceptor Controllable Solids Program. This effort is dependent on pentile technology that is proprietary to the Aerojet-General Corporation, to which the Government intends to award this effort. Demonstration testing of this technology is planned for FY 2011. The Government has determined that award of this effort to any other source would result in duplication of costs to the Government and unacceptable delays in developing the required technology. The period of performance is through April 2011. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to the U. S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command / Army Forces Strategic Command, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801, ATTN: SMDC-RDC-AK/Koger.

<DESC>Synopsis:
This is a request for information (RFI) from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) seeking one or more commercial vendors capable of performing fluorine-free bulk material removal and surface polishing of niobium superconducting radio frequency (SRF) accelerating cavities.  The SRF cavities may be used as part of an International Linear Collider R&D program and for a proposed Project X facility to be sited at Fermilab. The primary objective is to develop one or more vendors capable of polishing internal SRF cavity surfaces to the specifications required by ILC R&D and Project X without utilizing fluorine based electropolishing.  
Fermilab requires one or more commercial vendors to perform surface removal and polishing on niobium superconducting RF cavities or on curved half-cells.  Potential offerors may submit interest statements on either or both the bulk material removal and the final polishing.  The requested process begins with receipt of fully fabricated cavities by the vendor and ends with the delivery of polished, dry cavities to Fermilab.  The following specifications are minimum requirements for the process when conducted on fully fabricated cavities:
•	Each cavity shall receive a degreasing wash by hot ultrasonic bath
•	Each cavity shall have bulk material removal and final polishing on the interior surfaces to the following specifications:
o	130 +/- 10 µm axially homogenous bulk material removal from entire inner cavity surface.
o	10 µm axially homogenous final polish of entire inner cavity surface
o	0.1 µm Ra internal surface finish.
•	Each cavity shall be rinsed with ultra pure water.
•	Each cavity shall be dried in class 1,000 cleanroom conditions.
A multi-phase effort may result from this procurement.  The following phases are envisioned:
•	Prior to procurement award, use existing polishing capability to polish several small flat niobium samples and submit to Fermilab for evaluation.  Existing polishing techniques should translate to curved surfaces.
•	Likely FNAL evaluation procedures to evaluate flat samples may include:  
o	Material removal determined by flat sample mass change.
o	Surface topography by 2-D average surface roughness (Ra) and max peak to valley height (Rz) and 3-D average surface roughness (Sa).
o	Surface chemical composition by relative resistivity ratio (RRR), EDS, XPS, or SIMS.

<DESC>Synopsis:
This is a request for information (RFI) from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) seeking one or more commercial vendors capable of performing electropolishing on niobium superconducting radio frequency (SRF) accelerating cavities.  The SRF cavities may be used as part of an International Linear Collider R&D program and for a proposed Project X facility to be sited at Fermilab. The primary objective is to develop one or more vendors who are fully capable of performing all preliminary surface processing steps, including electropolishing, on SRF cavity internal surfaces to the specifications required by ILC R&D and Project X.  Once the processing steps are verified to be within specification, a processing throughput of 2-3 or more SRF resonators per week is desired.
FNAL requires a commercial vendor to perform electropolishing and cleaning of niobium 1.3 meter long, 1.3 GHz nine-cell elliptical resonators.  The requested process begins with receipt of fully fabricated cavities by the vendor and ends with the delivery of electropolished, clean, and dry cavities to Fermilab.  The following specifications are minimum requirements for the process:
•	Each cavity shall receive a degreasing wash by hot ultrasonic bath
•	Each cavity shall have bulk material removal and polishing by the elctropolishing process on the interior surfaces the following specifications:
o	150 +/- 10 µm axially homogenous material removal by polishing from entire inner resonator surface.
o	0.1 µm Ra internal surface finish.
•	Each cavity shall be rinsed with ultra pure water.
•	Each cavity shall be dried in class 1,000 cleanroom conditions.
•	Each cavity shall receive an ultrapure ethanol rinse.
Potential vendors must be capable of developing a surface processing facility that successfully completes each of the above processing steps at the expected cavity throughput rate of 2-3 or more per week.  All infrastructure need not be currently in place.
The approximate timeframe for this procurement is as follows:
•	Expression of interest – by April 21, 2009
•	Proposal submission following RFP – by June 1, 2009.
•	Detailed design study submission from selected vendors due for evaluation by September 1, 2009.
•	Anticipated award date – January 1, 2010.
•	Facility design, development, and commissioning -- 1 year or less, starting January 01, 2010.
•	2-3 or more cavity processing rate per week beginning January 01, 2011 or earlier.
Offerors wishing to express interest should submit to the primary procurement contact a short statement about the following:
•	Vendor Capabilities
o	Electropolishing experience on variety of pure metals 
o	Niobium electropolishing
o	Surface cleaning experience
o	Chemical handling, including HF, H2SO4 and other strong corrosives
o	SRF component development and/or processing
o	Niobium handling history

<DESC>The NASA Johnson Space Center is planning to recompete the contract requirementsfor the current Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) Space Vehicle Mockup Facility (SVMF)Operations Contract (NSOC, NAS9-02102). The NBL and SVMF are key Agency assets thatsupport human space flight training and operations. Both facilities support the SpaceShuttle, International Space Station (ISS) and other future space programs. Both areoperated by JSCs Mission Operations Directorate (MOD). The current NAICS Code and SizeStandard are 541712 and 1,000 employees.  The current NSOC contract is mainly completionform (cost-plus-award-fee), with an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)feature that represents ~10 - 15% of the contract value.  The NBL provides a unique environment to simulate micro-gravity using underwater neutralbuoyancy techniques. It provides capabilities for astronaut training, real-time missiontrouble-shooting, extravehicular activity (EVA) procedure development and verification,flight hardware development and verification, water survival training, and support ofexternal customers.  Because of the NBLs importance to NASAs mission, and the highlyhazardous operations performed there, the NBL has high-visibility to Agency Managementand the general public. The NBL also includes a Logistics & Mockup Facility (LMF) thatprovides fabrication, repair, and upgrade of mockups for both the NBL and SVMF. The SVMF uses full-scale vehicle mockups, flight-like trainers, engineering test articlesand environmental simulators to provide a unique environment that closely emulates thephysical characteristics of crewed spacecraft. It provides capabilities for astronauttraining, real-time mission trouble-shooting, mission development, flight proceduresdevelopment and verification, flight vehicle sustaining engineering, developmentalengineering analysis, and support to external customers. The SVMF also has visibility toNASA management, the media and the general public. Both the NBL and SVMF support external customers; i.e., those from organizations outsideof MOD. These include other JSC Directorates (e.g., Engineering, Space Life Sciences, andPublic Affairs), other NASA field centers (e.g., KSC, MSFC), other government agencies(e.g., U.S. Coast Guard) or commercial companies. The support provided includes use ofthe NBL for submerged operations or water survival training, use of the SVMF for KSCground crew proficiency training, and the use of both facilities for media andeducational events. The mockups used in the NBL and SVMF are full-scale (1:1) models of spacecraft orspacecraft components. Depending on their purpose, mockups can vary from low fidelity,which models the basic volume and shape of the spacecraft/component, to high fidelitywhich very closely matches the look and feel of the spacecraft/component. Mockups canbe built to last briefly (e.g., for short-term engineering evaluations) or for manyyears. NBL mockups are usually made from stainless steel, composites and plastics. SVMFmockups often use steel and aluminum in addition to composites and plastics. The intent of this RFI is to solicit comments from industry and to solicit capabilitystatements from qualified companies. The current NSOC Statement of Work and otherpertinent documents are located in the technical library on the procurement websitehttp://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/nsoc/index.htm	 . These documents are for informationand planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness andfeasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.Industry is invited to provide inputs in the following specific areas:1.   Identify barriers to competition that could be mitigated to foster a morecompetitive environment for this procurement. 2.	Contract Type and Performance: Please provide your view regarding what type ofcontract provides the best approach for this type of work.	How should the risks versus rewards be shared by the Government and contractor?How does the proposed contract type incentivize the contractor to perform high qualitywork at a reasonable price? Discuss your views specific to this contract regardingincentive fees, award fee, award term and/or other appropriate incentives for contractorperformance in terms of: 1) fixed price requirements; 2) cost type requirements. 3.	Suggest any portions of this procurement for which fixed price contracting couldbe utilized. Discuss your rationale for each and your thoughts on the feasibility ofeach. In addition, how can NASA design/structure the fixed price portions of the contract to:1) ensure outstanding facility safety and operations safety are maintained; 2) protectthe ability of the contractor to respond rapidly and effectively to facility oroperational anomalies; 3) maintain the flexibility needed to handle unplanned workwithout invoking excessive cost or contracting delays (the duration of such unplannedwork may vary from a few hours to several days); and 4) ensure that small business goalsare met or exceeded. Discuss all alternatives you would like NASA to consider.	4.	Discuss any factors that should be considered when determining contract lengthand any resulting contract duration recommendations.   5.   What metrics could NASA use to monitor the contractors performance on: 1) the fixedprice portions; 2) the portions that are not fixed price? 6.	Discuss ways in which NASA could design/structure this procurement to maximizecost control during the design and fabrication of mockups, while retaining theflexibility to make affordable requirements changes as required. Discuss allalternatives you would like NASA to consider.7.	Discuss ways in which NASA could design/structure this procurement to maximizesynergy by combining similar work at both facilities; e.g., processes, labor resources,mockup design and fabrication skills. Discuss all alternatives you would like NASA toconsider.8.	NASA is considering ways to increase the use of the NBL and SVMF by externalcustomers, on a mission non-interference basis, as a potential means of reducinglong-term costs. 	Discuss any changes that NASA might need in processes, procedures and operatingstandards to successfully attract more external customers. What industry standards shouldNASA adopt? What special terms or conditions would NASA need to accept? Discuss ideas andincentives to encourage the contractors efforts to find additional external customersfor the NBL. 9.	Recommend process improvements and efficiencies, both in the acquisition phaseand the performance phase, along with identification of non-value-added steps. NASA/JSC is also soliciting information about potential offerors including largebusinesses, Small Businesses (SBs), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) 8(a), HUBZones,Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs), Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs),Service-DisabledVeteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs), and Historically Black Collegesand Universities/Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) that are potential sources for thisrequirement.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is expanding the radar capabilities at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF). This involves the addition of High Spectral Resolution Lidars (HSRL) operating at our North Slope of Alaska, Barrow, Research Site and with our second ARM Mobile Facility designed for operation in marine environments. The HSRL is a class of elastic LIDAR with the capability of distinguishing between photons scattered from molecules and those scattered by aerosol or cloud particles. This measurement selectivity is achieved with the use of very narrow bandwidth filters in order to isolate the aerosol return from the Doppler broadened molecular return. This enables independent retrieval of aerosol backscatter and extinction coefficients, while providing significantly better measurement sensitivity as compared to the Raman lidar technique.
<p>Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, Management &amp; Operating Contractor of the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is requesting information from prospective offers to provide HSRL in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Wavelength = 532 nm using frequency stabilized laser <br />&bull; Laser pulse width ~40 ns <br />&bull; Repetition rate ~ 4 kHz <br />&bull; Reciever field of view: ~45 microradian to minimize multiple scattering <br />&bull; Reciever aperture: 40 cm <br />&bull; Reciever spectral bandpass: 6 GHz (pressure tuned etalon) <br />&bull; Aerosol blocking filter bandwidth: 1.8 GHz <br />&bull; Data acquisition system: photon counting <br />&bull; Altitude range: 0 to 30 km <br />&bull; Time resolution: ~2.5 s <br />&bull; Vertical resolution: 7.5 m <br />&bull; Enclosure, configuration, and environmental design suitable for arctic, tropic, and marine environments <br />&bull; Eye safe laser energy levels at the exit of system optics <br />&bull; Low Maintenance, 24 hour, 7 day/week operations <br />&bull; Installation completion by 9/30/2010 - project timelines are critical and will be monitored. Early delivery is preferred.</p>
<p>Interested firms shall also provide information in the following areas as available:<br />1) A description of current experience, knowledge and capabilities directly applicable to the performance of the scope identified.<br />2) Brochures providing descriptions of equipment, maintenance and standard warranty, along with a current published commercial pricelist.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort that will best address PNNL's needs. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.

<DESC>The NASA Research Centers (Ames, Langley, Dryden, and Glenn) are discussing thepossibility of consolidating requirements for Safety, Environmental, and MissionAssurance Services (SEMAS).  These NASA Centers have undergone transformations fromprincipally research Centers to research and product Centers, there are many similaritiesin terms of the nature of the work these Centers are expected to accomplish.  Inaddition, these Centers have faced several years of constant and increasing budgetpressures. Therefore, we have had to focus on the efficient use of the resources we have. We believe that if developed properly, a consolidation could achieve improvements in anumber of areas:1) Further enhance existing, and foster future, inter-Center collaborations & projectsupport2) Opportunity to exchange best practices3) Cost avoidance and cost savings by pooling requirements4) Leveraging opportunities  currently every Center performs all SEMAS functions.  Is itnecessary for each Center to perform all functions, or could efficiencies be gained fromdividing functions amongst the Centers? As an example, if Center A is an expert in aparticular area of SEMAS could Center A manage that component for one of more of theother Centers? 5) Increase commonality in service definitions and delivery methods6) Enable common metrics7) Creation of surge capacity across Centers to respond to unknown/unknownsWhile Ames is currently in acquisition planning stage of its SEMAS requirement, it is nottoo late to consider the consolidated approach if feedback warrants it.   Specifically, we seek Industry comments to help us identify benefits, efficiencies, andprocess improvements, and leveraging advantages that may come to bear if Research Centerrequirements were to be consolidated.  Similarly, if there are risks or negative impactsassociated with adopting a consolidated contract for SEMAS, it is equally useful tosurface these now so they can be considered when making a decision on the finalacquisition approach.  Accordingly, we seek comments on the two scenarios set forthbelow:Scenario 1:  Consolidated contract, Single Award (Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity(IDIQ) with Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Task Orders)1.  Is a "Consolidated" single award contract a good idea?  If so why, if not, why not?2.  Assuming a single award is made, please describe your view of the mechanics of theapproach.  In other words, how could this work?3.  What are the benefits?  Please explain your response.4.  What is the downside/cost/impacts of the approach.	Please explain your response.Scenario 2:  Consolidated Contract, Multiple Award (Indefinite Delivery IndefiniteQuantity (IDIQ) with Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Task Orders)1.  Is a "Consolidated" Multiple Award contract a good idea?  If so why, if not, why not?2.  Assuming a Multiple Award is made, please describe your view of the task orders  bycenter, function, other?3.  What are the benefits?  Please explain your response.4.  What is the downside/cost/impacts of the approach.	Please explain your response.Please note that ARC has issued a separate RFI asking for industry feedback on thevalue/utility of a Multiple Award IDIQ FFP Task Order contract separately.  We intend touse industry feedback from both RFIs when making the decision on the final acquisitionapproach for the SEMAS requirement.

<DESC>Special Notice SN09-28: Low-Cost Lightweight Portable Photovoltaics (PoP);
Proposers’ Day Workshop, DATE: April 29, 2009; REGISTRATION DEADLINE:
April 24, 2009; TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Cindy Daniell, DARPA/DSO, Email:
TeamPop@darpa.mil; URL: www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm

In anticipation of a potential program on the topic of Low-Cost Lightweight Portable Photovoltaics (PoP), DARPA is hosting a Proposers’ Day Workshop that will provide critical information on the program vision, the program milestones, and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary team to respond to a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). The goal of the PoP program is to develop revolutionary technologies that greatly reduce the mass and cost of portable photovoltaic devices while at the same time supporting high power conversion efficiency.  Specifically, DARPA seeks new integrated photovoltaic technologies that have at least 20% power conversion efficiency (under AM1.5 illumination at one sun) in a form factor amenable to low-cost production on flexible substrates.  The proposals must support truly durable, portable devices with high flexibility and low total device density.  To meet this challenge, technologies that incorporate thin-film semiconductors, microcrystalline semiconductors, or materials with similar properties will be considered.  Proposers must address all aspects of portable photovoltaic devices: light acquisition, energy capture, carrier extraction, robust and durable portability, and flexibility.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  In addition, research requiring Multiple Exciton Generation (MEG) as a critical path element to achieve the stated Program Metrics is specifically excluded from consideration.

An interdisciplinary team will be required to perform the effort and meet the program’s
milestones. The PoP Proposers’ Day will facilitate the formation of teams with the
necessary expertise to respond to the BAA.

The PoP Proposers’ Day Workshop will be held at The Executive Conference Center,
3601 Wilson Blvd Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22201, 8:00am-4:00pm, April 29, 2009. 
The goals of the teaming and information session are to: (a) introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the PoP program vision and goals; (b) explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this particular effort; and (c) encourage and promote teaming arrangements among potential organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the PoP program goals. The teaming and information session will include overview presentations by Government personnel and poster sessions to facilitate interaction and team building among the session participants. Additionally, a teaming website will be provided to facilitate these interactions and can be found at http://www.sainc.com/PoPTeaming.


Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas described in the forthcoming BAA will be critical to the success of the PoP program. DARPA will not be funding component technologies that address only a subset of the technologies listed in the PoP solicitation.

PoP Proposers’ Day Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters
describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate communications, interactions, and teaming discussions during the poster session. Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location, and lodging are given on the registration website at 
http://www.eventmakeronline.com/schafer/View/index.asp?MeetingID=8
(Password = Solar).

There is no fee for the PoP Proposers’ Day Workshop. Registration is limited (maximum 100 people; 1 person per organization) by the venue capacity and early registration is strongly recommended. The Poster Session will be limited to 1 poster per organization with a cut-off of 60 posters total. The registration cutoff date is 4:00PM ET, April 24, 2009.

For any questions related to this effort please e-mail TeamPop@darpa.mil.  Please refer to the PoP Proposers’ Day Workshop (DARPA-SN-09-28) in all correspondence. This announcement is not a request for proposals; any so sent will be returned.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI): Multi-qubit Quantum Coherent Operations
<SOLNBR>IARPA-RFI-09-01
<RESPDATE>042409
<ARCHDATE>04252009
<CONTACT>Michael Mandelberg, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-09-01@ugov.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS
The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process.  This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future IARPA program, so that feedback from potential participants can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA.  Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below.  Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA Program BAA and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution.  The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.


BACKGROUND & SCOPE
This year marks the fifteenth anniversary of Peter Shor’s seminal work demonstrating that a quantum computer can efficiently solve problems of great intrinsic and practical interest for which there is no known efficient solution on a classical computer.  During the following two years, he and others showed how quantum error correction provides a means to create a reliable quantum information processor out of faulty components.  Within a few years of Shor’s initial paper, several quantum systems of fundamentally different character were proposed as the basic units of quantum information memory and processing, i.e. as qubits.  The intervening years have witnessed steady progress in the basic understanding and operation of these qubits.

IARPA is requesting information about challenges facing coherent operations of multi-qubit quantum information processing systems.  Responses should articulate the specific technical difficulties that face, or will soon face, attempts to construct and operate small quantum information processors, and suggest aggressive but realizable paths toward overcoming them.  A particular qubit technology should be addressed, although a hybrid system is acceptable if its advantages demonstrably outweigh its disadvantages.  Qubit systems of interest are those that have clearly demonstrated complete single qubit control, and for which a two qubit coupling, with a clear path toward a scalable universal two qubit gate, has already been demonstrated, or for which this two qubit capability has been well described, has a sound theoretical basis, and for which experimental validation is imminent.  There must also be no fundamental roadblocks standing in the way of constructing quantum processors with many of the selected qubit.

Systems of interest must be able to demonstrate arbitrary and controllable entanglement, and are amenable to the circuit model of quantum computing (to include measurement based protocols such as the cluster state approach).  Some of the physical systems of particular interest are:  ions in surface traps, superconducting Josephson junction circuits, trapped neutral atoms, spins in semiconductor quantum dots, and photons in integrated optical components.  Of less interest are solutions that involve distributed quantum systems and so-called Type II quantum processing systems, or early research not yet ready for scaling to implement multi-qubit operations.

Respondents are encouraged to be as succinct as possible while providing specific information that addresses the following questions:

•  What is the physical qubit(s)?
•  What are the compelling reasons to use this qubit(s) in relation to coherent operations of multi-qubit quantum information processing systems?
•  What is known about this qubit(s) in terms of experimental and theoretical results?  Please provide suitable references.
•  What are the appropriate metrics to measure performance of a multi-qubit quantum processor?
•  What are the challenges facing coherent operations of multi-qubit quantum processing systems starting from the known status of this qubit(s)?
•  What solutions are being suggested to overcome these challenges?
•   What is the timescale needed to demonstrate these solutions?
•  What are the resources needed?
•  Are supporting technologies readily available?

The responses to this RFI will be used to help in the planning of a one and a half day workshop on multi-qubit quantum processing, the result of which may justify a multi-year competitive program.  The selection of topics and setting of the agenda of this workshop will be informed by the responses.  It is anticipated that this workshop will be held in early May, 2009.  A separate workshop announcement will be posted with further details.


PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS
IARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program.  IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and estimated cost of the proposed approach.  This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed. 

IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the US.  Because IARPA is interested in an integrated approach, responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged.  Responses have the following formatting requirements: 

1.  A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPA-RFI-09-01; 
2.  A substantive, focused, one-half page executive summary; 
3.  A description (limited to 5 pages in minimum 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins) of the technical challenges and suggested approach(es);
4.  A list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached);
5.  Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key ideas.


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS
Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:00pm, Local Time, College Park, MD on 24 April 2009.  All submissions must be electronically submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-09-01@ugov.gov as a PDF document.  Inquiries to this RFI must be submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-09-01@ugov.gov.  Do not send questions with proprietary content.  No telephonic inquiries will be accepted.  


DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES 
This is an RFI issued solely for information and new program planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Respondents are advised that IARPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. 

Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  It is the respondents' responsibility to ensure that the submitted material has been approved for public release by the organization that funded whatever research is referred to in their response.

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on responses received.  Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in the submittal.  Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by IARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.

Reference the following links for additional information:<br />Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch in 5 CFR Part 2635: <br />2002 CFR Title 5, Volume 3<br />Conflict of Interest laws in Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States Code: <br />Title 18 United States Code<br />Financial Disclosure requirements in 5 CFR Part 2634: http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/5cfr2634_05.html<br />The Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution (See Sec. 9, Clause 8): http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html <br />3 FAM 4120 (Employee Responsibilities Abroad): <br />http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/85177.pdf<br />e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical<br />1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.<br />2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. The Government will reimburse the cost of medevac insurance premiums. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).<br />3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.<br />(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.<br />(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.<br />f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.<br />g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.<br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.<br />3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimburseable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.<br />4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so, and based on medical opinion, contractor is fit to return to duty.<br /><br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. Such authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.<br />5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not also a U.S. holiday.<br />6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.<br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.<br />A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.<br />Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.<br />8) Passport<br />All passports must be valid for the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.<br />h.

Insurance<br />1) Worker's Compensation Benefits<br />The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.<br />2) Health and Life Insurance.<br />a) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 75% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, excluding costs for private medical evacuation (medevac) insurance, if any, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.<br />b) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 33 1/3% against the actual costs of annual basic life insurance coverage on the same basis as the U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program. Basic life insurance coverage is defined as coverage up to an amount equal to the contractor's annual basic salary rounded up to the next even $1,000 plus $2,000.<br />c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide coverage or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under paragraphs i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.<br />d) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.<br />e) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health and/or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under i. Insurance 1) and/or 2), respectively, of this provision.<br />3) Medevac Coverage<br />a) U.S. Citizens: U.S. citizens who meet the medical clearance requirements are furnished medical evacuation service at no cost.<br />b) Non U.S. citizens do not qualify for government furnished medical evacuation service at no cost and thus will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance. CDC shall reimburse 100% of the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance maintained by the contractor. CDC does not require that contractor obtain coverage from any one specific company. The contractor is responsible for and has the discretion to choose a provider. For information purposes only: The Department of State maintains a list of U.S. based providers on the following website: <br />http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/brochures/brochures_1215.html<br />CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance. CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract. After receipt of an offer letter, the contractor shall furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance and its cost, for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders, in order for CDC to reimburse the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance.<br />j.

The initial evaluation will take place 6 months after contract award and each subsequent evaluation will be performed annually 12 months from the date of the initial evaluation, and each year thereafter on a recurring 12 month schedule. A final evaluation will be performed at contract completion. The Performance Based Matrix included in this contract as Attachment 1 will serve as the basis for evaluation. A Personal Services Contractor Evaluation Form will be used and will be provided after contract award. Awarding of any contract extension shall be contingent upon receipt of an evaluation reflecting at least a satisfactory (acceptable, passing) level of performance under the contract during the previous 12 months of service. The reviews shall be scheduled and coordinated with the CDC Field Supervisor. The Field Supervisor shall provide the PSC employee with the appropriate performance standards for this position.<br />k.

(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 
6.302-1 (1) (ii) Unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities.

(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

NOAA and CHS have control over the maritime charts and has established this software as the only software that is capable of testing the chart data.

(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. 

*Requirement shall be posted on FED-BIZ-OPS with this JOTFOC.

(7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 

*It is anticipated that the purchase prices offered by the Contractor will be fair and reasonable, as compared to applicable Market Research. Market Research has shown similar items prices to be equal or more that the purchase price of the units being purchased.

(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 
Market research indicated that there is one US distributor of this software.  The manufacturer was contacted and indicated the software could be procured from Jeppesen.  The requirement has been solicited on DHS First Source with no response as of the posting of this notice.

(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: 
(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. 
(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. 
(iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government. 
The cost of a commercial application is 9000.00 (with maintenance), whereas cost for a government developed equivalent application would be estimated at $641,520.00 for coders.  The USCG will use this software application to QA ENC chart data used by navigation applications and provide feedback to hydrographic offices.  Without this flow of feedback from the fleet of CG cutters, there is a greater potential for ship groundings and maritime accidents related to erroneous chart data.

(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. 
Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. Englewood, CO;   Wildflower International, Ltd. Sante Fe, NM
(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. 
*None required.
(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. 
(b) Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.

Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity
which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

2.   HD Motor Oil:   15w-40   API rating:  ?????            Do you want the latest API rating:  CJ-4 ?      If you have any diesel engines built since 2007, API:  CJ-4 is       required for emissions.  Using a lesser rating will damage       the emission control system if the vehicle is so equipped.   

Answer: The SM will be fine for the 5w-30 and the CJ-4 for 15w-40.
Question: Buy Specifications: Line Item Description
Line item description is "Dexron II" . GM abandoned this specification years ago, replaced with Dexron IIE, then replaced with Dexron III.  General Motors only certifies and license Dexron VI for 2006 and newer vehicles.  It also covers all the old  specifications for Dexron.  Is Dexron VI acceptible or do you want a generic Dexron III?
GM Dexcool concentrate or 50/50?
Will the border patrol provide a loading dock and forklift to unload the drums if palletized?
Answer:  Dexron III and the Dexcool will need to be pure not 50-50.  We will help unload the drums.

Motor Oil:   5w-30  API rating:  SM       That is the latest API rating and should be very adequate
 
2.   HD Motor Oil:   15w-40   API rating:  ?????            Do you want the latest API rating:  CJ-4 ?      If you have any diesel engines built since 2007, API:  CJ-4 is       required for emissions.  Using a lesser rating will damage       the emission control system if the vehicle is so equipped.   

Answer: The SM will be fine for the 5w-30 and the CJ-4 for 15w-40.
Question: Buy Specifications: Line Item Description
Line item description is "Dexron II" . GM abandoned this specification years ago, replaced with Dexron IIE, then replaced with Dexron III.  General Motors only certifies and license Dexron VI for 2006 and newer vehicles.  It also covers all the old  specifications for Dexron.  Is Dexron VI acceptible or do you want a generic Dexron III?
GM Dexcool concentrate or 50/50?
Will the border patrol provide a loading dock and forklift to unload the drums if palletized?
Answer:  Dexron III and the Dexcool will need to be pure not 50-50.  We will help unload the drums.
Question:For the 15W40 HD Motor Oil. The product we offering meets API CJ-4 Standards. It this acceptable?
Answer: Yes acceptable<BR><BR>200 drums will need to be shipped on an 18-wheeled tractor-trailer. Fork-lift operator provides a pallet clamp & chain that can pull the cargo to the edge of the trailer, then slip under the pallet. Drums are palletized with 4 per pallet.  It will take a government owned fork-lift and operator to remove them.  This is the lowest price method to freight 200 drums.  This is the most common method we use when shipping to Army and Air Force bases, but don't know if the Border Patrol has the dock, equipment, and personnel to unload 200 drums in this method.<BR><BR>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FA8202-09-R-1000<br />A-10 European and Pacific In-theater Depots<br />Draft RFP and Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>The A-10 System Program Office (SPO) hereby posts the attached draft RFP for industry consideration and would also like to announce a pre-proposal conference to discuss the United States Air Force requirement for in-theater contract depot repair support for A-10 aircraft based overseas at Spangdahlem AB, Germany (USAFE) and Osan AB, Republic of South Korea (PACAF). The A-10 SPO is interested in meeting with industry representatives to answer questions and receive feedback regarding this requirement to assist with acquisition planning and program strategy.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br />There are two separate contracts associated with this Pre-Proposal Conference. For each region of operation, Europe and the Republic of South Korea, the U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Requirements type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Future aircraft modification programs may also be a requirement for these contracts. Best Estimated Quantities are included in the attached RFP. Please note that although Precision Engagement modifications will be included as a requirement for PACAF, this will be an optional CLIN. As of this time, the USAF has not made a final decision on whether to accomplish PE at the in-theater contract depot.</p>
<p>In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (400 Nautical Miles) of the respective A-10 operating location (Spangdahlem or Osan AB).</p>
<p><strong>Draft RFP</strong></p>
<p><br />The attached draft RFP is being included for industry comment/consideration and IS NOT a formal Request for Proposal. The government seeks industry feedback on all aspects of this draft solicitation including the PWS. In addition, the government is seeking input on the following items of interest:<br />1. The number of flow days the contractors feel that each FFP task will require as set forth in Section B. <br />2. The feasibility of providing past performance that meets the relevancy criteria in Section M, para 2.1.2.<br />3. The clarity of technical evaluation subfactors in Section M, para 2.4 - 2.6.<br />4. The clarity of Section L, Instructions to Offeror</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please provide written comments on the draft RFP by 1600 MST 13 Mar 2009.</span></strong></p>
<p>Not all portions of the draft-RFP are being posted at this time. Updates/additions will be posted when and if they become available. Please check FBO often for updates.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>1. The purpose of this conference is to provide open dialogue between government and industry in response to the draft RFP. In order for this to be an effective exchange, the government requests a list of agenda topics and specific questions that industry would like the Government to address. The Government does not intend to present additional information beyond what has been made available in the draft RFP and previous FBO postings. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please submit your agenda topic recommendations and specific questions to the industry day POC not later than 13 March 2009.</span></strong> Early submissions are encouraged.</p>
<p><br />2. At this time the government does not intend to limit the number of representatives attending from each contractor's firm. However, depending on responses from industry, the government may be forced to impose limits due to room capacity.</p>
<p><br />3. In order to attend Industry Day, each contractor must provide the following for each attendee:</p>
<p><br />a. Name, address and CAGE code of firm<br />b. Indicate status of company - Small Business or Large Business<br />c. Full Name of individual, citizenship status and contact information<br />This information must be received by the Pre-Proposal Conference POC via email not later than 13 March 2009.<br />In addition, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all foreign national attendees must submit a Foreign Visit Request through their respective embassy and provide a clearance number.</span></strong> Please contact the Pre-Proposal Conference POC with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p><br />4. If time permits, one-on-one sessions may be offered on 17 March after the open sessions. These sessions will be coordinated at the conclusion of the open session.</p>
<p><br />5. An optional tour of the Ogden Air Logistics Center A-10 Depot Repair Line is being considered. Please indicate your interest in attending a tour and the names of attendees by <strong>13 Mar 2009</strong>. Note: this tour will be identical to the tour given at the Nov 2008 industry day. No new information will be provided and this is primarily geared towards contractors who were unable to attend the November 2008 industry day tour.</p>
<p><br />6. A Base Access Letter will be coordinated in advance once your RSVP and Foreign Visit Request (if applicable) have been received. If you require any assistance obtaining base access or directions to Hill AFB please advise the Industry Day POC.</p>
<p><br />7. Additional details regarding this Industry Day will be posted once they become available. Please check back for updates. For advanced planning purposes the conference will be held in Building 1234, Main Conference room at Hill AFB, UT in the West Area. The conference will begin at <strong>0800 MST on 17 March</strong>. Please plan on arriving at the conference location by 0745 to sign-in.

<p>Please submit RSVPs and agenda topics as soon as possible. They are due NLT 13 March 2009. See paragraph 3 below for full details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FA8202-09-R-1001<br />A-10 European and Pacific In-theater Depots<br />Draft RFP and Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>The A-10 System Program Office (SPO) hereby posts the attached draft RFP for industry consideration and would also like to announce a pre-proposal conference to discuss the United States Air Force requirement for in-theater contract depot repair support for A-10 aircraft based overseas at Spangdahlem AB, Germany (USAFE) and Osan AB, Republic of South Korea (PACAF). The A-10 SPO is interested in meeting with industry representatives to answer questions and receive feedback regarding this requirement to assist with acquisition planning and program strategy.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p><br />There are two separate contracts associated with this Pre-Proposal Conference. For each region of operation, Europe and the Republic of South Korea, the U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Requirements type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Future aircraft modification programs may also be a requirement for these contracts. Best Estimated Quantities are included in the attached RFP. Please note that although Precision Engagement modifications will be included as a requirement for PACAF, this will be an optional CLIN. As of this time, the USAF has not made a final decision on whether to accomplish PE at the in-theater contract depot.</p>
<p>In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (400 Nautical Miles) of the respective A-10 operating location (Spangdahlem or Osan AB).</p>
<p><br /><strong>Draft RFP</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><br />The attached draft RFP is being included for industry comment/consideration and IS NOT a formal Request for Proposal. The government seeks industry feedback on all aspects of this draft solicitation including the PWS. In addition, the government is seeking input on the following items of interest:<br />1. The number of flow days the contractors feel that each FFP task will require as set forth in Section B. <br />2. The feasibility of providing past performance that meets the relevancy criteria in Section M, para 2.1.2.<br />3. The clarity of technical evaluation subfactors in Section M, para 2.4 - 2.6.<br />4. The clarity of Section L, Instructions to Offeror</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please provide written comments on the draft RFP by 1600 MST 13 Mar 2009.</span></strong></p>
<p>Not all portions of the draft-RFP are being posted at this time. Updates/additions will be posted when and if they become available. Please check FBO often for updates.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>1. The purpose of this conference is to provide open dialogue between government and industry in response to the draft RFP. In order for this to be an effective exchange, the government requests a list of agenda topics and specific questions that industry would like the Government to address. The Government does not intend to present additional information beyond what has been made available in the draft RFP and previous FBO postings. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please submit your agenda topic recommendations and specific questions to the industry day POC not later than 13 March 2009.</span></strong> Early submissions are encouraged.</p>
<p><br />2. At this time the government does not intend to limit the number of representatives attending from each contractor's firm. However, depending on responses from industry, the government may be forced to impose limits due to room capacity.</p>
<p><br />3. In order to attend Industry Day, each contractor must provide the following for each attendee:<br />a. Name, address and CAGE code of firm<br />b. Indicate status of company - Small Business or Large Business<br />c. Full Name of individual, citizenship status and contact information<br />This information must be received by the Pre-Proposal Conference POC via email not later than <strong>13 March 2009</strong>.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In addition, all foreign national attendees must submit a Foreign Visit Request through their respective embassy and provide a clearance number.</span></strong> Please contact the Pre-Proposal Conference POC with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p><br />4. If time permits, one-on-one sessions may be offered on 17 March after the open sessions. These sessions will be coordinated at the conclusion of the open session.</p>
<p><br />5. An optional tour of the Ogden Air Logistics Center A-10 Depot Repair Line is being considered. Please indicate your interest in attending a tour and the names of attendees by <strong>13 Mar 2009</strong>. Note: this tour will be identical to the tour given at the Nov 2008 industry day. No new information will be provided and this is primarily geared towards contractors who were unable to attend the November 2008 industry day tour.</p>
<p><br />6. A Base Access Letter will be coordinated in advance once your RSVP and Foreign Visit Request (if applicable) have been received. If you require any assistance obtaining base access or directions to Hill AFB please advise the Industry Day POC.</p>
<p><br />7. Additional details regarding this Industry Day will be posted once they become available. Please check back for updates.

<DESC>Synopsis:
This is a request for information (RFI) from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) seeking one or more commercial vendors capable of performing fluorine-free bulk material removal and surface polishing of niobium superconducting radio frequency (SRF) accelerating cavities.  The SRF cavities may be used as part of an International Linear Collider R&D program and for a proposed Project X facility to be sited at Fermilab. The primary objective is to develop one or more vendors capable of polishing internal SRF cavity surfaces to the specifications required by ILC R&D and Project X without utilizing fluorine based electropolishing.  
Fermilab requires one or more commercial vendors to perform surface removal and polishing on niobium superconducting RF cavities or on curved half-cells.  Potential offerors may submit interest statements on either or both the bulk material removal and the final polishing.  The requested process begins with receipt of fully fabricated cavities by the vendor and ends with the delivery of polished, dry cavities to Fermilab.  The following specifications are minimum requirements for the process when conducted on fully fabricated cavities:
•	Each cavity shall receive a degreasing wash by hot ultrasonic bath
•	Each cavity shall have bulk material removal and final polishing on the interior surfaces to the following specifications:
o	130 +/- 10 µm axially homogenous bulk material removal from entire inner cavity surface.
o	10 µm axially homogenous final polish of entire inner cavity surface
o	0.1 µm Ra internal surface finish.
•	Each cavity shall be rinsed with ultra pure water.
•	Each cavity shall be dried in class 1,000 cleanroom conditions.
A multi-phase effort may result from this procurement.  The following phases are envisioned:
•	Prior to procurement award, use existing polishing capability to polish several small flat niobium samples and submit to Fermilab for evaluation.  Existing polishing techniques should translate to curved surfaces.
•	Likely FNAL evaluation procedures to evaluate flat samples may include:  
o	Material removal determined by flat sample mass change.
o	Surface topography by 2-D average surface roughness (Ra) and max peak to valley height (Rz) and 3-D average surface roughness (Sa).
o	Surface chemical composition by relative resistivity ratio (RRR), EDS, XPS, or SIMS.
o	Hardness measurements via Rockwell/Brinell/Vickers and micro-hardness.
•	If deemed necessary and appropriate, selected vendors may be requested improve or provide an alternative polishing technique to meet ILC R&D and Project X specifications.
•	Upon procurement award, vendor(s) must develop polishing capability for the inner surfaces of a fabricated 1-cell 1.3 GHz elliptical RF cavity and polish several 1-cell cavities.
o	Likely FNAL procedures used to evaluate 1-cell polishing technique:
&#61607;	Ultrasonic thickness measurements along cavity length.
&#61607;	Optical inspection to detect surface defects and non-homogenous polishing.
&#61607;	RF frequency measurements at room temperature.
&#61607;	Cryogenic RF measurements of cavity accelerating gradient.
•	The final phase of the procurement is to develop polishing capability for the internal surfaces of a fabricated 9-cell 1.3 GHz elliptical cavity and polish several 9-cell 1.3 GHz RF cavities.
o	Likely FNAL procedures used to evaluate 9-cell polishing technique:
&#61607;	Ultrasonic thickness measurements along cavity length.
&#61607;	Optical inspection to detect surface defects and non-homogenous polishing.
&#61607;	RF frequency measurements at room temperature.  RF field flatness measurements may be included.
&#61607;	Cryogenic RF measurements of cavity accelerating gradient.
The approximate timeframe for this procurement is as follows:
•	Expression of interest – by April 21, 2009
•	Proposal submission following RFP – by June 1, 2009.
•	Anticipated award date – September 1, 2009.
•	Flat sample study completion December 31, 2009.
•	1-cell cavity polishing design, development, and evaluation -- 1 year or less, starting January 01, 2010.
•	9-cell cavity polishing design, development, and evaluation – 1 year or less starting January 01, 2011 or earlier.


Offerors wishing to express interest should submit to the primary procurement contact a short statement about the following:

Vendor Capabilities and/or experience
o	Surface polishing, especially niobium or similar metals 
o	Surface cleaning
o	SRF component development and/or processing
o	Niobium handling history
o	Other relevant expertise

•	Prior to procurement award, use existing polishing capability to polish several small flat niobium samples and submit to Fermilab for evaluation.  Existing polishing techniques should translate to curved surfaces.
•	Likely FNAL evaluation procedures to evaluate flat samples may include:  
o	Material removal determined by flat sample mass change.
o	Surface topography by 2-D average surface roughness (Ra) and max peak to valley height (Rz) and 3-D average surface roughness (Sa).
o	Surface chemical composition by relative resistivity ratio (RRR), EDS, XPS, or SIMS.
o	Hardness measurements via Rockwell/Brinell/Vickers and micro-hardness.
•	If deemed necessary and appropriate, selected vendors may be requested improve or provide an alternative polishing technique to meet ILC R&D and Project X specifications.
•	Upon procurement award, vendor(s) must develop polishing capability for the inner surfaces of a fabricated 1-cell 1.3 GHz elliptical RF cavity and polish several 1-cell cavities.
	Likely FNAL procedures used to evaluate 1-cell polishing technique:
	Ultrasonic thickness measurements along cavity length.
	Optical inspection to detect surface defects and non-homogenous polishing.
	RF frequency measurements at room temperature.
	Cryogenic RF measurements of cavity accelerating gradient.
	The final phase of the procurement is to develop polishing capability for the internal surfaces of a fabricated 9-cell 1.3 GHz elliptical cavity and polish several 9-cell 1.3 GHz RF cavities.
	Likely FNAL procedures used to evaluate 9-cell polishing technique:
	Ultrasonic thickness measurements along cavity length.
	Optical inspection to detect surface defects and non-homogenous polishing.
	RF frequency measurements at room temperature.  RF field flatness measurements may be included.
	Cryogenic RF measurements of cavity accelerating gradient.
The approximate timeframe for this procurement is as follows:
•	Expression of interest – by April 21, 2009
•	Proposal submission following RFP – by June 1, 2009.
•	Anticipated award date – September 1, 2009.
•	Flat sample study completion December 31, 2009.
•	1-cell cavity polishing design, development, and evaluation -- 1 year or less, starting January 01, 2010.
•	9-cell cavity polishing design, development, and evaluation – 1 year or less starting January 01, 2011 or earlier.


Offerors wishing to express interest should submit to the primary procurement contact a short statement about the following:

Vendor Capabilities and/or experience

DISCUSSION OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECT INFORMATION JGPO and NAVFAC look forward to the continued dialogue with Industry at the upcoming Guam Industry Forum.  We will present and discuss broad level project information for the first years of construction in the Guam program.  This is scheduled to be discussed during the NAVFAC Acquisition Strategy presentation.  
We will present approximate estimated ranges for types of projects that will comprise initial construction efforts (e.g. airfield facilities, waterfront facilities, major utilities distribution, road upgrades etc.).  Detail project priorities, costs, scope, and justification will be made available on www.guamindustryforum.com when it becomes publicly available.
We understand the importance of hearing as much project information as possible and appreciate your cooperation.  Thank you for making arrangements to travel to Guam and being part of this exciting program.

<p>The National Assessment Governing Board requires the services of a contractor to prepare a design and implement a study to examine the feasibility of using reading achievement levels developed in 1992 for reporting results of the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in reading for grades 4 and 8.</p>
<p>The Governing Board has awarded a Fixed Price sole source contract to the Educational Testing Service (ETS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13.106-1(b)(1)as only one responsible source can provide the required services.</p>
<p>The data to be used for this study are secure. As the incumbent contractor with the National Center for Education Statistics, ETS is authorized to conduct data analysis for the secure data collected for the reading assessment. The analyses required to compute the scaled data and to compute and locate the cut scores on the score scale are complex. The 2008 field trial data for reading at grades 4 and 8 includes an unusual data collection design for NAEP, called a braided design, which was designed and implemented by ETS to link score scales and maintain trend. ETS developed the methodology for scaling the data, and is therefore uniquely well-qualified and equipped to perform these analyses for the Governing Board study. Please see solicitation no. &nbsp;EDNAGB-09-000040 for further details.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 
Washington, D. C. 20593-0001
