<SUBJECT>14 -- Aerial Target System to Simulate a Subsonic Cruise/Supersonic Sprint Sea-Skimming Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Threat
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-Aerial-Target-RFI
<ARCHDATE>04052006
<CONTACT>Jennifer  Augustine, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-5896, Fax (301) 757-5955, Email Jennifer.Augustine@navy.mil - Michael McLoughlin, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-757-5898, Fax 301-757-5955, Email michael.mcloughlin@navy.mil
<DESC>In February 2005, the Navy Aerial Target and Decoy Systems Program Office (PMA-208) of the Program Executive Office for Strike Weapons and Unmanned Aviation [PEO (W)], conducted a Request for Information (RFI). The United States Navy has an emergent requirement for a cost-effective aerial target system to simulate a Subsonic Cruise/Supersonic Sprint Sea-Skimming Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Threat. This Target System will be used to support current Fleet training of weapon systems as well as the test and evaluation of ship self-defense systems currently in development. Examples of these programs in development include, but are not limited to, the SM-6, AEGIS, and DD (X) programs. It is anticipated that the target program will enter System Development and Demonstration (SD&D) in early FY-07 timeframe. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is desired in late FY-10. As a result, the program office is considering various acquisition strategies in order to meet the cost, schedule and performance requirements. These strategies may include, but are not limited to: new development; modification of current target or missile systems; and conversion of surplus missiles in US inventory. ///////

Subsequent to the original RFI the program requirements have been refined and the Navy has nearly completed writing the Capabilities Development Document in anticipation of submission for review in March 2006.  Information that may be critical for Industry to refine its concepts for the Threat-D target system has been uploaded to the PMA-208 web site (Titled: Threat-D Industry update.ppt) at http://www.navair.navy.mil/pma208/  Click on “Current Events” and then “Threat-D Targets.”  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES HAVE ALSO BEEN POSTED TO THE ABOVE SITE (TITLED: THREAT-D QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, DATED 2 MAR 2006). ///////

PMA-208 intends to conduct another Industry day in the next few months, and anticipates posting the Industry Day announcement by the end of March 2006 on FEDBIZOPS.  Industry day subjects will include status of the program and anticipated schedule. ///////

All inquiries should be delivered via email to Jennifer Augustine, jennifer.augustine@navy.mil and Joe Valenzuela, joseph.Valenzuela@navy.mil. ///////

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION SOLICITED OR PROVIDED.  Questions or comments may be addressed to Ms. Jennifer Augustine at (301) 757-5896, email jennifer.augustine@navy.mil or Mr. Joe Valenzuela at (301) 757-6115, joseph.valenzuela@navy.mil email.
