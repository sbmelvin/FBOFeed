<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Joint Commission Resources (JCR), a subsidiary of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO).  VA is one of the largest health care systems in the nation.  Currently, the VA has a need for trained and knowledgeable faculty to conduct didactic education sessions for 65 hospitals on JCAHO’s new accreditation process and tools that will be used, standards and associated changes.  The project must also include on-site consultation regarding new tracer methodology by trained and knowledgeable faculty with the latest information and expertise to provide this service. Only JCR can provide these services at this time due to a recent change in policy concerning surveyors no longer serving as consultants.  In addition, JCR consultants have received the latest information on standards, technology and process for the new accreditation process scheduled for implementation in January 2004. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties with the capability to provide the required services should submit a capability statement that demonstrates the bona fide ability to meet the specific requirements to Carrie Parish at carrie.parish@mail.va.gov, phone number (202) 273-6057.

<DESC>Description
The Department of Health and Human Services, National Vaccine Program Office, contemplates single or multiple awards of a contract for a domestically produced, reliable and secure source of cell based monovalent influenza vaccine for use in an influenza pandemic.

Because this could be an issue of health security for any country and that local supplies of influenza vaccine might be reserved for local populations, as an issue of health security the U.S. government is limiting manufacture of the pandemic influenza virus vaccine to domestic sources only.  This would allow the USG to have surge capacity for U.S. citizens in the setting of a global influenza pandemic
 
The following apply:

1.	Documented history of successful development and licensure of a vaccine for human use in the U.S. or Europe is mandatory.
2.	The research and development process and manufacturing facilities needed to satisfy regulatory requirements of the FDA.
3.	The pandemic virus will be a novel strain, such as the avian influenza viruses (H5N1) that infected people in Hong Kong in 1997 and in China in 2003, or the H7N7 strain that caused infections in Belgium and the Netherlands in 2003.

Only written requests, directly from the requestor, will be accepted.  Email requests will be accepted.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Requests should reference the solicitation number, state the name of the firm, name of the requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address.  Requests should be mailed to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ATTN:  Peter Penny, 2920 Brandywine Road, Room 3705, Atlanta, GA  30341.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Iris Walter, Eagle Systems & Services, Inc. via fax at 256-544-4789 or email at iris.walter@msfc.nasa.gov not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 26, 2004.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in full and open competition to implement the program described below. The BAOJ has been a joint effort between the Bolivian and U.S. governments since 1992. That year USAID/Bolivia (USAID/B) authorized an eight year BAOJ project to support democratic development in Bolivia through support for the Rule of Law that included institutional reforms and subsequently the implementation of the Code of Criminal Procedures. The latter effort has brought a full criminal system reform in the country aimed at replacing an inquisitorial system for a modern accusatorial, oral one. The Code of Criminal Procedures reforms introduced in Bolivia result in speedier and more transparent trials, and improved democratic participation because it requires citizens to participate fully as citizen judges in the decisions affecting their lives and rights. The BAOJ project is now at a point where further work is needed to strengthen and sustain accomplishments. Emphasis will be on the passage of further enabling legislation, the strengthening of key justice system institutions, and the training of justice system actors to facilitate consolidation of the criminal system reforms.  At the same time, in the coming period, the program must address new problems with respect to social conflicts (nationwide, but particularly in the western highlands and the coca growing regions) and regarding technical support for urgently needed commercial and administrative law reform. The new, five-year BAOJ project's purpose is to a) assist in drafting and passing complementary legal reforms and regulations related to the CCP; b) create an integrated and sustainable capacity of justice system institutions and operators to successfully adapt to the needs of the new CCP and achieve the consolidation of the reforms introduced by the CCP; and (c) promote and implement commercial and administrative law reform to enhance the transparency, consistency and predictability of judicial decision-making and governmental action in the commercial arena. The contractor will continue to expand the legal reforms in progress as well as to strengthen the justice system institutions involved. The contractor will work with indigenous groups and women to address issues related to protection of the more vulnerable groups of society. The contractor will replicate previously piloted activities to facilitate access of the most disadvantaged groups to justice. This will include technical assistance to Integrated Justice Centers.  An Integrated Justice Center (IJC) is a site or group of sites that concentrates a variety of formal and informal justice services to increase access to justice in neglected areas where there are high levels of social conflict.  Such assistance will include work with the GOB to improve local government financing and to provide institutional, financial and advisory support in an attempt to achieve sustainability of the IJCs. The contractor will work closely with other projects in the democracy sector such as the legislative strengthening project, and the Civil Society for Justice Reforms Netwrok to share information regarding activities to date and to identify issues/problems that may require assistance. The contractor will also work closely with other USAID/B Strategic Objective Teams (SOTs), such as the Alternative Development team to pursue the objectives of the BAOJ. One Performance-based Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract will be awarded for implementation of these activities. Implementation will occur over a five year period. Further information about exact location and time will be forthcoming. We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a February 26, 2004. Contact person is Jose Zenteno: Phone 591-2-2786445, Fax 591-2-278568

<DESC>The U.S. Treasury Department provides technical assistance and policy advice to senior government and central bank officials and market participants in nearly 30 countries. We are recruiting candidates for positions as resident (long-term) and intermittent (short term) advisors in government debt issuance and management in countries throughout the world, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Southeast and Central Asia, Latin America, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. This recruitment is for global assignments and significant international travel is required.

For resident (long-term) assignments, we seek experts in domestic government securities issuance and management. Experience in international bond markets is highly desirable. Applicants for resident assignments ideally should have a combination of public and private sector experience in government debt management, investment banking or financial advisory work. For intermittent (short term) assignments, we are seeking advisors with particular expertise in: liability management policy and procedures; legal framework for government securities; market regulation; custody, clearing and settlement; fixed income trading; treasury operations; and mortgage and other asset-backed finance. For all positions, management experience is desired. Prior overseas work experience in challenging environments is a distinct advantage. Foreign language skills are highly desirable. While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of host government officials and provide sound but realistic advice to a sovereign government in an emerging market environment will determine ultimate success.  Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.

SALARY AND BENEFITS: Salaries are negotiated in accordance with program regulations, based on demonstrated salary history and the skills required. The salary range is from $85,000 to $134,000, subject to January 1, 2004, cost of living adjustments (COLA).  Overseas benefits are provided as allowed by federal regulations.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce has a requirement  to provide support to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)/Non-Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) Cooperative Program.  BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION  - The United States assists the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, the Baltic countries, Central Europe Countries, and other countries to assume the full responsibility for preventing the proliferation of equipment and technologies that could be used in the development or delivery of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Department of Commerce, in conjunction with other U.S. Government agencies, works with these countries in establishing fair and effective national export control systems. The BIS/Non Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) group has been working in cooperative outreach programs with export control organizations in these countries since 1994. The level and scope of NEC’s outreach efforts have increased due to the growing concerns of the U.S. Government regarding the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems. For example, in FY 2003, NEC conducted more than double the number of technical exchange activities from the previous year (approximately 75 - 95). This has required NEC to restructure its contract mechanisms and redefine the roles and relationships between federal staff and contract support staff. Historically, the NEC group requires contractor support in the areas of: TRAINING DEVELOPMENT – The contractor shall work under the direction of the NEC group to identify training modules for development in order to meet the requirements of particular cooperating countries. These modules augmented the existing NEC training material originally established as part of the NEC Course Curriculum. These training materials satisfy learning objectives that are established by NEC in a model country plan. The appropriate mix of instructional methods and delivery approaches (e.g. lecture, role-play, simulations group discussions) was evaluated and integrated into the training material to meet the learning objectives. The Contractor shall maintain a technical library of Government-owned course material, program books, and other materials which is Government property. The library shall allow access to previously developed training material, agendas, and presentations (electronic and hard copy form) for use in planning future programs.  TRAINING DELIVERY AND DEPLOYMENT – The Contractor shall deliver training courses to export control officials and experts in cooperating countries in the various export control areas (e.g. legal, regulatory, licensing, control lists, industry/Government relations, export enforcement). These courses are to be delivered in the US in a government owned facility to foreign delegations from participating countries. The contractor is also to deliver training workshops, seminars and conferences in foreign locations. For both the foreign and domestic training delivery activity, the Contractor shall be responsible for organizing the material, arranging for translation, and coordinating speakers from within the Department of Commerce, other U.S. Government agencies and U.S. industry. Program books shall be built and reproduced for the technical exchanges/seminars and copies of course materials shall be provided to the foreign trainees. In order to ensure the most widespread use of the training material and software training tools within the client country, the contractor shall, at times, provide specific hardware such as computers, zip drives or other computer peripherals.  NEC is interested in exploring creative strategies for the delivery of training materials.  MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL EXCHANGES - Many times a year, the NEC group works with cooperating Governments and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) to sponsor export control conferences on a variety of topics. These conferences can be specific to the host country or can be regional in nature. In order to effectively manage these conferences, the Contractor shall established business relationships with the conference hosts who have in turn handled the local logistics including venue, speakers, program material, simultaneous interpretation, and other miscellaneous support activities. As a co-sponsor of these conferences, the NEC group will often ensure a US presence at the conferences. The Contractor shall work with the NEC group to identify and prepare U.S. Industry participants who will be part of the US delegation to the conference. MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM DEPLOYMENTS -As a result of efforts since 1994, the NEC group has made significant progress with cooperating Governments in building export control institutions. In particular, as the cooperating country’s export control systems are developed, the need to have good industry and Government cooperation has become apparent. In the field of industry-Government relations, the contractor developed software tool, the Internal Control Program (ICP), shall be modified and adapted to the regulatory environment of specific cooperating countries. The ICP tool establishes a framework for the foreign industry to comply with its own Government’s export control regulations and meet international standards regarding control of strategic commodities. The Contractor shall work with the export control agency or its designated NGO to establish a plan to modify and deploy these country specific versions of the ICP tool. Efforts shall be made to encourage all countries to adopt all 10 elements of the generic ICP model, but the ultimate product shall be a function of the cooperating country’s specific export control law and regulations. A rapid series of ICP deployments have taken place in Russia, Ukraine, and a select set of Central European countries. Based on the number and geographical diversity of the foreign enterprises, the Contractor shall be required to handle some deployments independently of the NEC group. LOGISTICS SUPPORT  - In the course of conducting the international training program, both in the US and abroad, the contractor shall  plan and manage logistics for both US and foreign nationals for ticketing, billeting, conference facility management, and ground transportation.  OTHER ACTIVITIES - Based on the number of countries and the expanding scope of activities under the NEC outreach programs, the NEC group may require the Contractor to perform other unique tasks as they arise. These requirements may be generated by outside agencies such as State and Defense Departments who are trying to coordinate their activities with the NEC group. NEC envisions a greater contractor role in the continuous planning for fiscal year budget submissions based on medium to long-range strategic goals and in planning, scheduling and implementing short-term (one year) operation plans. NAICS Code: 541611. Size Standard: $6.0. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  HOWEVER, IT WILL CONTAIN THE PROVISIONS OF A CASCADING SET-ASIDE PREFERENCE WHICH PUT LARGE BUSINESSES ON NOTICE THAT, IF THE AGENCY RECEIVES A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESS OFFERS, LARGE BUSINESS PROPOSALS RECEIVED SIMPLY WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.

<DESC>This synopsis is issued for comments on the draft Request for Proposal, PWS and attachments only.  This requirement is to replace outdated mailing systems at 444 locations throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam and various remote locations.  Installation shall also include Coast Guard cutters home ported on the east, west, and gulf coasts of the United States.  The U.S. Coast Guard processes millions of pieces of mail annually at more than 444 locations throughout the world, including aboard Coast Guard Cutters.  The Coast Guard Cutters often perform operations at sea for periods ranging from a few weeks to 6 months or more. As a result, the equipment type and maintenance program must ensure that cutters can sustain meter operations for these periods. While each of these locations has a designated Official Mail Manager, this is not a full-time position and processing mail is a collateral duty shared by many different personnel.  Consequently, the Coast Guard relies on automation to minimize errors and the time spent handling and processing mail.  A copy of the RFP and PWS with attachments can be obtained from FedBizOpps following this listing. Interested parties are strongly encouraged to download their own copy of the draft RFP.  Industry comments will be fully considered in preparation for the final RFP.  The USCG will not provide individual responses, and requests that no general telephone or email inquiries be made to the Contracting Officer or any USCG employee. Comments on the draft RFP, PWS and attachments shall be submitted no later than February 23, 2004, 11:00 a.m. (EST).  All responses must be submitted electronically to Ms. Faye Jones, fjones@comdt.uscg.mil. This request for comment is not a commercial solicitation and the Government will not pay for any information submitted or for any costs associated with providing this information.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard Research and Development Center (RDC) is the Coast Guard's lead facility performing research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) in support of the Coast Guard's major missions of Maritime Law Enforcement, Maritime Safety, Marine Environmental Protection and Homeland Security. A critical element in many RDC programs is the conduct of operations analysis through the use of modeling and simulation. As a result, the RDC’s Operations Analysis Information Support (OASIS) program was formed to actively engage the Coast Guard operational community as a means to develop practical modeling and simulation solutions that give decision makers an understanding of how current and future technologies may be exploited to improve operational performance. Operations analysis will be an integral part of our projects designed to provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of emerging technologies whose development could have a profound impact on force structure and operational efficiency and effectiveness.  RDC's recent focus has been on developing constructive simulations that investigate the value of new technologies such as sensor, C4ISR and platform capabilities to support Coast Guard operations. OASIS needs an analysis capability that can respond quickly, and at a reasonable cost.  Future research areas requiring OASIS support include war gamming, man-in-the-loop simulation, situation awareness tools, tactical decision aids, process reengineering, intelligent agent development, intelligence correlation and fusion, and knowledge management.

The anticipated scope of work covers applications of operations analysis, modeling and simulation and decision support tool development in support of the RDC’s OASIS program. Skills required include, applied mathematics, operations research, computer science, management science, artificial intelligence, electrical engineering, applied statistics, modeling, simulation, cost analysis, risk assessment, and risk management. Anticipated tasking includes development of models and simulation, conducting cost and effectiveness trade studies, performing analysis of data, analysis of specific systems or technologies, mission/engagement level analysis; campaign, resource allocation, and force planning analysis; analysis of human factors, and operations analysis support tool development. 

The Coast Guard intends to award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee provisions.  The period of performance is five (5) years.  The following factors are to be evaluated:  personnel; technical and management approach; past performance; and cost realism.  This acquisition is unrestricted based on Full and Open Competition. NAICS Code is 541511.  Award will be based on Best Value to the Government.  For information concerning this solicitation, please contact the contracting official cited below.  This contracting office does not issue solicitations in paper form.  Solicitations may be accessed on an electronic posting system at the following web site: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>HVAC INSTALLATION SERVICES are required for the A.J. Celebrezze Federal Building located at 1240 East Ninth Street in Cleveland, Ohio.  The scope of services under this proposed contract involves fan coil replacement for floors 2 through 30 of the building. Since the building will remain fully occupied by various Federal tenants, it will be the responsibility of the contractor to phase and coordinate all work around these tenants and their normal operations.  The estimated cost of this project falls within the range of $10.0 million to $20.0 million, with an anticipated project duration of approximately thirteen (13) months.  Funds are not currently available for this acquisition.  A firm, fixed-price contract is contemplated.  Contractor selection will be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for Source Selection procedures and the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Proposal process.  A two-stage evaluation process will be used.  In stage-one, offers will be evaluated against go/ no-go qualification factors that consider minimum technical requirements.  The requirements are past experience, past performance, and key team members.  Proposals from responsive, responsible firms found technically acceptable will move on to stage-two of the evaluation process where prices will be reviewed.  The intention is to make award to the LPTA, responsible offeror.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations if it is determined to be in its best interest to do so.  This procurement for Building Alterations falls under NAICS code 236220.  It is open to both large and small businesses.  The small business size standard for this work category is $28.5 million.  Although this procurement is open to large businesses, small, small woman-owned, small minority-owned, small HUBZone, small Veteran-Owned, and service disabled Veteran-Owned firms are strongly encouraged to participate. Large business will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, small woman-owned, HUBZone small, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and Veteran-Owned Small business and service disabled Veteran-Owned business concerns through participation as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  As part of the technical package, each firm submitting an offer as a large business will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan in compliance with the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals set by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.  Large firms shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for the above mentioned concerns.

<DESC>This Request For Information (RFI) solicits commercial industry input to support an update of the existing guidance contained in the Ã¢Â€ÂœContractor Support in the Theater of Operations Deskbook Supplement,Ã¢Â€Â dated 28 March 2001.  This RFI does not constitute a Request For Proposal and the Government does not intend to make a contract award in conjunction with this RFI.  The current Deskbook Supplement is located at: http://akss.dau.mil/servlet/ActionController?screen=Policies&Process=3. Any industry comments received to this effort will be considered for potential inclusion in the updated Deskbook Supplement.  The U.S. has a long history of using contractors on the battlefield and our use is increasing as we continue to reduce DoD uniform ed & civilian force structure.  The legal basis for using contractors lies in Title 10 Section 129a, which authorizes the Secretary of Defense to use civilian contracting if it is beneficial to the government and consistent with military requirements.  The  Ã¢Â€ÂœContractor Support in the Theater of Operations Deskbook SupplementÃ¢Â€Â was first promulgated on 28 March 2001.  The purpose of this document is to provide references and offer suggestions on generic contract terms and conditions that may be appli cable for inclusion in contracts written to support contingency operations.  Update of this guidance is deemed beneficial to capture industry input on this subject, which may include lessons identified from recent operations.  The format for submissions is  left to the submitterÃ¢Â€Â™s discretion.  However, specific phrases, language, terms or conditions are desired to minimize the potential for misinterpretation.  General comments to this update effort may also influence overarching DoD policy.  However, it  is not the intention of this RFI to respond to industry inquiries on existing policy.  Email is the preferred means of receipt.   Submissions in response to this RFI are expected to be unclassified.  Address for the Submission of Responses:  Responses sen t via conventional mail should be sent to the following address:  The Joint Staff; Attention:  LT G. D.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intend to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc., Thornwood, New York, to 10594,  to purchase an upgrade to an existing government owned Zeiss LSM 510 Confocal Microscope.   The LSM 510 Confocal microscope UV system will require the Zeiss 405 upgrade package which will enhance performance and add new capabilities, which were not available upon the initial purchase of the equipment.    The existing government confocal UV microscope was manufactured by Carl Zeiss, Inc., and therefore only a Carl Zeiss upgrade is compatible.  A change in the product would effect ongoing laboratory research and threaten the investment already made, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.      This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of FAR Part 6.   There are no small business set-aside restrictions for this requirement.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339111 and the Size Standard is 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only soliciation; quotes being requested & written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.  Submit offers on RML-RFQ #4017.  Solicitation documents & incorporated provisions & clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-19 dated 1/1/2004.  This acquisition will be processed  under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) & is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325998 & the small business size is 500. SCHEDULE: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP), has been charged with performing basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. The sequencing of bacterial genomes and the interpretation of that genome data is paramount to those diagnostic and vaccine based discoveries. The LHBP now has the need to take completed bacterial genome sequences, sequenced within and external to the LHBP, and perform Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) phylogeny analysis of them. The Contractor shall generate and provide to LHBP two(2) sets of phylogenetic trees based on synonymous SNPs. The first set of trees shall be a comparison of seven genomes. The second set of trees will be all the genomes in the first set plus one more. This is a 30 day, one time work effort, where the final product will be the production of maps and spreadsheets presenting hyperlinked and interactive data for SNPs for each genome, phylogenetic calculations, and SNP-based phylogenetic trees. The contractor shall keep all RML derived data secure and will not release or maintain any of the data beyond this contract effort. If Internet connectivity is needed in order to perform the work, or transfer deliverables, contractor computers shall be secure and in compliance with RML IT security procedures and policies.  LHBP will provide genome data generated by previous or current LHBP research efforts that are needed for construction of the files.  
Step 1: Identify conserved backbone and variable regions of the Genomes.
The contractor shall identify those regions in every genome that vary and correspond to phages, phage regions across the given genomes, and the conserved backbone genome sequence for all of the targeted genomes. Other regions of variation, identified by the contractor, could include remnants of integrated prophages, transposons, or any other hypervariable components. A combination of manual analysis and pre-existing computational tools shall be employed to ensure the information required for the SNP analysis of these  genomes is produced accurately and of the highest quality possible. Identification of phage and conserved backbone regions shall take not more than four(4) days. Identification of other hypervariable regions shall take not more than an additional three(3) days. Identification of phage commonality across genomes will take not more than two(2) days. Total not more than nine(9). Deliverables: The contractor shall deliver to RML maps for each genome describing the conserved backbone, phage regions, and other hypervariable regions in each genome. The contractor shall also create a spreadsheet identifying which phage regions are present or absent in the genomes being analyzed.  Step 2: Calculate and identify synonymous SNPs. After identification of the conserved backbone and phage regions of the genomes, the contractor shall determine the SNPs in the set of strains and identify those SNPs that are synonymous based on the set of ORFs present in all eight given genomes using existing contractor technology. The contractor shall also analyze the zones conserved in not all eight genomes but only in related genomes and identify the synonymous substitutions in them. Identification of SNPs shall take not more than five(5) days; analysis of partially conserved zones shall take an additional not more than three(3)days. Total not more than eight (8)days Deliverables: The contractor shall deliver to RML an Excel spreadsheet containing all primary information about each SNP and its position relative to both the contig it is located on, and the gene it is relevant to, along with links into an ERGO database that will display sequence alignments. The contractor shall also generate a plot similar to the one published in Garnier, et al., (2003) PNAS 100: 7877, which shows the number of SNPs per ORF.  Step 3: The contractor shall build a distance matrix and construct a robust phylogenetic tree. The contractor shall examine the synonymous SNPs in the context of orthologous groups of genes, which shall make it possible to calculate a distance matrix and to construct a robust phylogenetic tree. Two phylogenetic trees shall be constructed for the given set of genomes. The first tree shall be based upon only the conserved backbone of the genomes without phage regions removed from the data. The second tree shall be based on both the conserved backbone and the phage insertions.  This latter tree shall analyze the full genome sequences of the  genomes.  To ensure robustness of the generated trees, a number of matrices and trees shall be constructed for both data sets, based on different selections of genes. The generated trees will be examined for isomorphism. If the significant differences are encountered, the contractor shall attempt to identify the causes for them. To ensure statistical robustness of the generated trees the contractor shall perform bootstrap testing, via the  PHYLIP package or a comparable package .Construction of initial set of trees, verification of isomorphism – not more than five(5) days. Analysis of differences – not more than five(5) days. Construction of the final trees: not more than one(1) day. Verification of the robustness of trees – not more than two(2) days. Total not more than fourteen(1)4 days. Deliverables: The contractor shall deliver to RML all generated distance matrices and trees in Newick format.  Step 4: The contractor shall create publication quality tree images. A publication quality tree image shall be generated using a publicly available software package such as FORESTER. The composition of this image shall be determined between contractor and RML to meet the needs of the RML publication.  Duration, 5 days.  Deliverables: The contractor shall deliver to RML, publication quality images of the phylogenetic trees generated based on the conserved backbones of the genomes and the conserved backbone plus phage insertions. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Delivery as annotated above. The following FAR provisions & clauses apply to this acquisition: As of October 1, 2003,  All Vendor/Contractor (s) must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration System,  in order to do business with the Federal Government.  Lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for award. http://www.ccr.gov.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Radios must be compatible with current KSC installed UHF radios, two Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) VHF radio transmitters and receivers will be a Motorola CM 200, one Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) UHF radio transmitter and receiver will be a Motorola CM 200. Workstations in tower cab must be capable of using LACB installed backup radios if a tower radio fails. The task also requires installation of 32 channel DVD digital voice recorder system in the Tower, Installation of 1 workstation in the LACB, training for KSC technicians on new voice system, appropriate documentation in format designated by NASA/KSC following completion of project, systems to be connected to the workstations include 3 Point to Point telephones, 6 FAA shout lines and 5 local radio nets, installation of  provided tunable antenna and run new heliax cable from the antenna to the rear area of the tunable A/G radio located in the tower, for connection of existing A/G radios at the LACB to the touch screen interface, and providing antennas and other necessary hardware for all eight radio systems.  Offeror shall deliver an operable voice communication control system for the NASA Shuttle Landing Facility Air Traffic Control Tower and LACB with installed systems set to KSC designated frequencies.    Facility shall be available from 7am to 3:30pm local time. All contactor employees must obtain KSC badge.  Delivery and installation should be within 90 days of order placement. 
2.  The Government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price order to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  FAR 52.212-2 titled “Evaluation-Commercial Items” shall apply.  Technical merit is more important than price.  However, when technical differences become less significant, price will become increasingly more important.   Total proposed price will be evaluated.  Prices that are excessively high or low

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Firms submitting a proposal must register in the GSA ITSS system prior to closing date for receipt of proposals.   Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Fl is equipping its new Air Traffic Control Tower. This requirement was originally solicited under another solicitation number and cancelled.  Two proposals were received under the cancelled solicitation.  (Previous price quotations received under the cancelled RFP ranged from $260,000 to $279,000).  The tower requires a fully integrated Voice Communications System for Air Traffic Control. This system will provide control of air-to-ground and ground-to-ground communications to include access to radios and public and private telephone networks. This work should meet technical standards set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control tower radios and communication systems.  The system should have superior voice quality and non-blocking access to all audio channels. A touch screen control panel is preferred. Four workstations are required. Three workstations will be located in the tower cab in console locations designated by KSC. One workstation will be installed in the Landing Aids Control Building (LACB). LACB is located approximately 2 miles from the tower. Eight air to ground radio systems are required for the tower. Three radios will be GFE.  Successful offeror will procure additional radios as described below and install all eight systems at the tower location. The work to be performed includes installation of 3 workstations in the Air Traffic Control Tower cab, installation of 5 VHF radio systems in the Tower. Radios must be compatible with current KSC installed VHF radios, installation of 3 UHF radio systems in the Tower. Radios must be compatible with current KSC installed UHF radios, two Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) VHF radio transmitters and receivers will be a Motorola CM 200, one Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) UHF radio transmitter and receiver will be a Motorola CM 200. Workstations in tower cab must be capable of using LACB installed backup radios if a tower radio fails. The task also requires installation of 32 channel DVD digital voice recorder system in the Tower, Installation of 1 workstation in the LACB, training for KSC technicians on new voice system, appropriate documentation in format designated by NASA/KSC following completion of project, systems to be connected to the workstations include 3 Point to Point telephones, 6 FAA shout lines and 5 local radio nets, installation of  provided tunable antenna and run new heliax cable from the antenna to the rear area of the tunable A/G radio located in the tower, for connection of existing A/G radios at the LACB to the touch screen interface, and providing antennas and other necessary hardware for all eight radio systems.  Offeror shall deliver an operable voice communication control system for the NASA Shuttle Landing Facility Air Traffic Control Tower and LACB with installed systems set to KSC designated frequencies.    Facility shall be available from 7am to 3:30pm local time. All contactor employees must obtain KSC badge.  Delivery and installation should be within 90 days of order placement. 
2.  The Government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price order to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  FAR 52.212-2 titled “Evaluation-Commercial Items” shall apply.  Technical merit is more important than price.  However, when technical differences become less significant, price will become increasingly more important.   Total proposed price will be evaluated.  Prices that are excessively high or low may be considered unrealistic and unreasonable, may receive no further consideration.  The Government will evaluate technical proposals based on the factors of past experience and technical approach with past experience being slightly more important than technical approach.  Past experience will be evaluated according to the extent to which the offeror’s documented past experience is similar to the nature, complexity, and scope of work described in the Statement of Work. The Government will evaluate each offeror’s technical approach for completeness, the extent to which it demonstrates that it will meet requirements in an effective manner, and qualifications of those assigned (if applicable) to carry out the technical approach being offered.    The offeror shall describe its approach for meeting the requirements of the SOW and how it plans to conduct the work.  To support the past experience evaluation, please list the dollar value of similar project, timeframe completed, brief description of your firm’s role in project, etc.  Technical proposals should be limited to no more than 10 pages.  The clause at FAR 52.212-4,Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition 11. The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, applies to this solicitation. Specifically, the following clauses cited are applicable to this solicitation: FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; FAR 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era; FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Handicapped Workers; FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era; FAR 52.222-42.

<DESC>ONR BAA Number 04-009
Questions and Answers

 
1) Has the Gov't secured the $1M yet?  If not, what is the likelihood of this coming through?    

We would not release a BAA unless we had the expectation that funding would be available to resource the effort.

2)  Can the proposed approach be less than 36 mos, i.e., 18 mos, and if so, will additional points be awarded to the offeror who proposes a shorter schedule?  Rationale is that our firm is well-ahead of competition.   

The BAA did not establish length of schedule as a specific evaluation criterion.  Offerors are expected to submit proposals that project a reasonably accurate schedule for the completion of the proposed work. 

3)  Clarification on the funding picture: $1M total or each year?    

$1M total. 

4)  What are the USMC vehicles associated with the load bearing requirements (MLC70T) and (MLC100W)? 

M1A1 with track-width mine plow attached for MLC 70. M1A1 on HETT or tractor trailer for MLC 110W.

5)  Does the bridge need to float? 

No, if there another way to cross large wet gap despite depth/bottom composition.

The way it is currently thought of is the bridge floats (aka Ribbon) or the bridge is simply supported using floating piers (e.g. Logistics Support Bridge).  The simply supported concept fits with the modular family type bridging where the same sections could be used.

6)  Please clarify the 3' of water requirement.  Is this 3' under water?  

3' water means that if floating, be able to float in 3 feet of water.

7)  Page 3 of the BAA - lists the bridge length as “indefinite” and also 40 meter. 

40 meters in one span, indefinitely with floats or other intermediate supports.

8)  Define "far shore support".  Personnel and/or equipment?  

If we're attacking north, we reach the south side of the river and have no personnel or equipment on the north side until the bridge is across it. We need a bridge that can be built in one direction. Personnel - basically trained Marine engineers; no bridge scientists. Equipment is basic engineer construction/material handling equipment.

 9) Deliverables - Item 1.   What is their expectation of the “demonstration article” listed?  

 Model of final design along with sample full-sized components if new material to demonstrate manufacturability, weight, etc.

10)  Does the requirement to give preference to disabled veteran owned companies apply here?  

No preference stated in the BAA. 
 
11)  What is the definition of LOC bridging?

Line Of Communication (LOC) Bridging - Bridging, which is semi permanent, fixed or floating, that is emplaced as soon as possible to replace Tactical Bridge assets until permanent bridges can be constructed or an alternate route opened.  This type of bridging is emplaced after the site is secured and is used to open main routes for military as well as civilian traffic.  They are designed to be emplaced for long periods of time over substantial gaps and are able to handle large numbers of vehicles.  Typical LOC bridges in service for the military are the Bailey Bridge (BB) and the Mabey&Johnson Logistics Support Bridge (LSB).

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide an update to the DHS SPIRIT Project.  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY.   1) First, we are revising the number of planned awards per tier per functional area.  The USCG anticipates award of approximately 5 awards per tier per functional area.  As a reminder, if adequate contract competition is not received in a particular tier of a functional area, we reserve the right not to award any contracts in that tier of the functional area.  2) We plan to release a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) (Sections B through H) for industry comment on or about February 20, 2004.  3) We plan to release the final RFP in late May 2004 with awards planned for 1st Quarter FY05.  4) It is our intent to leave the final RFP open for 30 days.   As such, it is to the benefit of all potential offerors to ensure that all comments are submitted to us by the cut-off date identified in the draft RFP so that they may be adjudicated and considered for incorporation into the final RFP.  NOTE:  Due to overwhelming interest in this requirement, no phone inquiries, e-mails or requests to meet “one-on-one” will be answered.

Further, the current methodology cannot guarantee repeatable zero after changing from day to night optics.  Improved performance in fog, dust, extreme darkness, foliage is also desired for the CNVD.  There are presently no IDIQ contracts for CNVD. The SO PMOD Program has a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(2) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS): While CNVD is the primary night vision system sought for future small arms, certain small arms remain more suitably served by dedicated night vision sights.  For these applications, an MNVS or similar alternative is required with ruggedization for use on the following platforms:  M14, M16, M249, M60, Mk11, Mk43, Mk46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, M2 .50 Caliber MG, and .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.  A variant is required with increased magnification power capability to include 4X-6X, improved resistance to fogging in rain, high humidity, and extreme temperatures, improved performance in fog, foliage, dust, and extreme low light, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, weight reduction, reduced snag hazard, decrease supportability  costs, improved reliability, improved platform mounting flexibility, improved protection for lenses, reticle upgrades, and instantaneous backup sighting capability.  The current contract for the MNVS will expire in FY 2003. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(3) ACOG Reflex:  improved performance in high humidity and rain, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, night vision upgrades, improved target acquisition for quicker engagement, miniaturization, reduced snag hazard, and improved performance of aiming dot in all lighting conditions.  The present contract for the ACOG Reflex has expired.  A recent contract has been established for the ECOS-N (Maritime Aim Point), however it also could benefit by improvement or replacement to achieve enhanced performance in rain and high  humidity, reduced snag hazard, incorporation of emergency backup sight, and size and weight reduction.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(4) ACOG 4X: improved performance in high humidity and rain, ergonomic improvement for use with backup iron sights, night vision upgrades, improved interoperability with night vision goggles, reticle illumination adjustment, improved eye relief, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and simplification of reticle pattern.  The present contract for the ACOG 4X has expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this 4X capability with a variable, switchable, or stacked sight that allows improved sighting both at close and long range.   A(5)  Backup Iron Sight: implementation of day and night sighting capabilities with an emphasis on light emission control, improved capability to maintain the set position in a combat environment, integration of short and long range capability with improved durability over existing inserts, and reduced snag hazards.  A(6) Rail Interface System:  incorporation of design features which improve overall system performance (possibly floating barrel design concept), improved cleaning and maintenance, improved the durability, and production cost reduction. Group B, Active Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Visible Bright Light (VBL), (2) AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Laser Pointer/Illuminator (ITPIAL), (3) AN/PEQ-5 Carbine Visible Laser (CVL) B(1)  VBL: Ruggedization, weight and size reduction, reduced snag hazard, improved reliability when used in automatic fire, and a variety that  provides for combination of Infra-red and white light capability into one module. Existing contracts for the VLI will expire in FY 2002. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(2) ITPIAL: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, pattern and pulse capabilities, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the ITPIAL have expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(3) CVL:  Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance with green and black targets, improved compatibility with laser eye protection, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the CVL have expired.  The SOPMOD P rogram desires to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this capability into a unified system. (b) Performance and Research Objectives Common to All Sub-systems:  The SOPMOD program is not seeking alternate sources for the currently fielded SOPMOD equipment named above, rather is seeking alternative sub-systems with the following improved operational performance characteristics as research objectives:  Increased user acceptance to include (1) Improved Operation Suitability to include improved performance in semi-automatic and full automatic fire, increased range, snag free in movement through vegetation and battlefield obstacles.  The overall objective is increased hit scores by SOF operators during day, night, rain, mist, smoke, vegetation, fog, dust, and extreme low light conditions. (2)  Mini aturization, to include reductions in both size and weight, with an objective of increased weapon portability and better weapon balance during the act of firing. (3)  Increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, and ease of cleaning. (4)  Recoil shock endurance sufficient to allow use on all SOF small arms.  Fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds threshold, 30,000 rounds objective. (5) Functional reliability exceeding that of the present subsystems at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf/temperature shock) environmental conditions. (6) Incorporation of improved safety features. (7) Low optical retro-reflection augmentation. (8) Improved lens performance in rain, fog, snow, dust, and other atmospheric conditions. (9) Improved lens protection, e.g. transparent sacrificial lens covers. (10) Improved eye relief whi ch provides optimum performance for SOF combat scenarios and host weapons. (11) Decreased life-cycle support costs. (12)  Improved power consumption, where applicable. (13) Incorporation of night vision capability where it currently does not exist. (14) Improved boresight retention. (15) Consolidation of current capabilities into multi-use systems.  This includes the integration of technologies currently fielded by multiple systems into single multi-use systems and utilization of modular technology, where such combinations are suitable for SOF combat. (16) Improved safety. 5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method. Items will be selected on a "Best Value" Contracting basis. IDIQ contracts will be awarded to offerors in accordance with the following plan: (A)  RCO Solicitation is to be published in July 200 2.  The RCO Solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Be advised that a DRAFT VERSION of the Performance Specification for the proposed procurement is available at the following web link:  http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/02R0014/02R0014.htm .  It is requested that this DRAFT Solicitation be reviewed by interested parties and provide any comments or questions to the Technical Point of Contract (Barry Gatewood) as idenn (Para.  3.3.2.3.1) QUESTION NO. 35:  What is the target run time that is desired?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 35:  There is no specific requirement for run time; however, a best value determination, with run time being a factor, will be made prior to contract award.  No run time data is available for current prod ucts. QUESTION NO. 36:  The request is for improved performance/reflectivity on green and black targets. What is the current effective range and what is the desired practical range the user desires to have?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 36:  See Performance Specification (Para.  3.3.2.3.3.1) QUESTION NO. 37:  What is the weight and size of the system that is currently being used?  What are the size weight targets?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 37:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.3.3.7) The current system measures 2.84 in x 2.54 in x 1.52 in and weighs 3 oz with batteries.  No specific targets have been set.  The system should be packaged as small as possible to not sacrifice performance. QUESTION NO. 38:  What patterns is being used?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 38:  Not applicable.  This is an ITPIAL specification.  Patterns are not required for the visible laser, but w ill be considered, if offered. QUESTION NO. 39:  How many more are needed?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 39:  Not applicable.  This is an ITPIAL specification. QUESTION NO. 40:  What pulse cycles are being used what other cycles would be needed? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 40:  Not applicable.  This is an ITPIAL specification.  Pulse capability is not required for the visible laser, but will be considered, if offered. QUESTION NO. 41:  What ruggedization improvements in particular are you asking for?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 41:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.4) QUESTION NO. 42:  What are the make and models of the systems that are currently being used? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 42:  Insight Technologies, Inc., Carbine Visible Laser, AN/PEQ-5, NSN: 5860-01-439-5409 QUESTION NO. 43:  What are the shortcomings that you want improved? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 43: See P erformance Specification, it describes the objective system.  QUESTION NO. 44:  While the Passive MDNS section makes allowances for providing improvements to the Rail Interface System, the Active MDNS for which we plan to submit makes no allowances for an improved RIS.  It would appear to be in the Government's best interests to not limit manufacturers to similarly submit improvements to the RIS under the Active MDNS subsystem as well.  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 44:  Manufacturers are free to submit proposals on any of the nine subsystems or any combination thereof.  The division of subsystems into active and passive groups was for organizational purposes only and was not intended to imply that proposals be submitted for the entire group. QUESTION NO. 45:  Section 3.3 SOPMOD Technology Requirements describes "Supplemental specifications" as existing capabilities, however late r under 3.3.2 Group B Active Miniature Day / Night Subsystems the "Supplemental Specifications are termed as minimum performance characteristics, i.e. threshold requirements.  This appears to be a conflict.  It is our interpretation the Supplemental specifications are not threshold requirements for this solicitation.   If these Supplemental specifications contained within the draft solicitation are considered threshold characteristics, they are limiting and overly restrictive.  For examples there are numerous supplemental specifications specifying the exact type of switch based on the existing hardware, the exact location of a switch based on the existing hardware, etc.  These overly restrictive specifications include but are not limited to sections 3.3.2.1.2.2 Switching Devices, Section 3.3.2.1.2.9  makes no allowances for the desire and ability to combine hardware as specifi ed in the ORD (See Wilcox comment 3), 3.3.2.2.2.3.2 Illumination Laser Beam Divergence, 3.3.2.2.2.6 Mode Switch, 3.3.2.2.2.8 Adjusters, 3.3.2.2.2.11 (makes no allowances for combining hardware as in ORD), 3.3.2.3.2.2 Switching Devices, etc.   ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 45:  The specification that will be published with the solicitation has been updated to include designation of KPP’s.  The supplemental specifications not designated as KPP’s are tradable. QUESTION NO. 46:  SOPMOD M4 ORD specifically states the visible laser pointer, visible bright light, infrared pointer and infrared illuminator can be integrated into a single active modular aiming device or a visible and an IR module.  While we have reviewed the draft solicitation, it does not appear to make allowances for the Enhancement of combining all the devices into one system. ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 46:  See Performance  Specification (Para. 3.2.15) 3.

<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes the second amendment to Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) N00164-02-R-0014 originally published on 27 MAR 2002 and amended on 28 JUN 2002.  This second amendment is being issued in response to questions received from industry concerning the DRAFT Performance Specification for pending solicitation number N00164-02-R-0014.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on 16 OCT 2002. The formal solicitation has not yet been issued. 2.  INDUSTRY QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT ANSWERS:   References cited in this amendment are from revision Preliminary 10 of the draft Performance Specification dated 21 June 2002.  The applicable questions and answers are as follows: QUESTION NO. 1:    3.2.12 Are DL-123 batteries acceptable for Group B Active Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 1:  The performance s pecification neither requires nor precludes the use of any specific battery; however, any battery chosen must be common and commercially available. QUESTION NO. 2:  3.2.15 Is an “all in one package” more desirable than the modular approach currently utilized? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 2:   Any proposed “all-in-one” solution must meet all of the KPP’s for each of the subsystems it is combining.  APP’s are, by definition, tradable.  Combined systems will be evaluated based on risks and benefits that the solution will provide the operator.  An all-in-one solution may or may not be more desirable.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 3:     3.3.2.1.2.8  At what point does the VBL become too bright?   ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 3:  The Operational Requirements Document (ORD) specifies  a minimum range of visible illumination, but does not include any specifications for luminosity.  Life Cycle Sustainment costs will be considered during the source selection process; therefore, the systems should be designed to be as efficient as possible and still meet the performance specifications. QUESTION NO. 4:    3.3.2.2.2.1 Is the “double tap” feature of the AN/PEQ-2 Pressure Pad acceptable for a constant  on function?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 4:  The ORD has not changed since the AN/PEQ-2 was fielded.  Improvements on the current design will be considered.  A “double tap” feature may or may not be more desirable.  This will be determined by operational and developmental testing.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 5:    3.3.2.2  Is a high-power illuminating (100 mw output) laser desired for sniper applications?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 5:  Sniper applications for infrared pointing, illuminating, and aiming capability are not within the scope of the upcoming solicitation.  There is no requirement for a 100mw laser; however, specific applications for pointing out to 5km in limited quantities are anticipated as separated contract line items.  The performance specification will be updated to reflect this requirement. QUESTION NO. 6:    3.3.2.2.2.6 Is there a requirement for an IR Illuminator only mode?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 6:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.2.2.6) QUESTION NO. 7:    3.3.2.2.2.8 Are low profile adjusters acceptable/preferred as currently incorporated into the  AN/PEQ-2 Model 5000?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 7:  Adjusters will be evaluated on several criteria including, but not limited to, ease of operat ion, snag hazards, glove accessibility, etc.  Low-profile adjusters may or may not be more desirable.  This will be determined by operational and developmental testing.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 8:    3.3.2.3.24  8a. The laser wavelength of 630 +/- 15nm (Red) is specified.  Is Green 535nm acceptable?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 8a:  The wavelength spec

<DESC>This is Amendment 0002 for a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items that was originally issued on 20 February 2003 and is hereby amended as follows: A.  The time by which offers must be received is changed from 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time to 2:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. (The closing date, 21APR03, is unchanged.) B.  In Addendum 2 to the solicitation, Page 1 of 5 is corrected to change Item 0000 to Item 0009. C.  In Addendum 4 to the solicitation, the first sentence of Paragraph A.3. is deleted and replaced by the following two sentences:  Separate proposals are required for each MD/NS subsystem being proposed.  Variants within each subsystem may be proposed within that subsystem proposal.  Each proposal shall include five (5) copies of Volume 1 and two (2) copies of Volume 2, 3 and 4. D.  In Addendum 4 to the solicitation, the second sentence of Parag raph D is deleted and replaced by the following: If the offeror is a small business, this volume shall describe the extent to which your company has identified and committed to provide for participation by small, small and disadvantaged businesses (SDB), woman owned businesses (WOB), historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institutions for the performance of this effort.  The Offeror shall provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the tasks assigned the selected small and/or SDB and WOB subcontractors are meaningful in the sense that they will be performing functions important to the overall success of the program and also broaden the subcontractor's technical capability.   The offeror shall describe their management approach for enhancing small, SDB and WOB subcontractor's technical capability.   Of special interest is the amount and type of  work to be performed by the subcontractors.  The offeror shall explain the reasons for and advantages of selecting particular subcontractors. E.  The solicitation states that “Initial inspection of the required supplies shall be performed by the cognizant DCMA and/or NSWC personnel at the contractor’s/sub-contractor’s facility.  Final inspection and acceptance shall be at NSWC Crane.”  This statement applies to all deliveries on the future contracts including prototypes and production hardware. F.  Additional details concerning the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations (as set forth in Addendum 3) are as follows: Oral Presentation/Demonstration:  Formal scheduling of the Oral Presentation/Demonstration will be conducted shortly after the solicitation closes.  The Government will notify each offeror of the date and time of the Oral Presentation/Demonstration at least two  weeks prior to the scheduled date.  The number of offeror representatives for each Oral Presentation/Demonstration shall not exceed six.  In order to facilitate the source selection process, the Government intends to schedule the Oral Presentation/Demonstration by MDNS subsystem rather than by offeror.  Offerors shall have up to 2 hours to present Powerpoint presentations, conduct any product demonstrations, and allow for a question and answer period.  It is anticipated that it will be possible for offerors to conduct limited operational demonstrations of passive devices, visible bright lights, and Class 3A lasers.  The Government is currently investigating the possibility of more detailed demonstrations at a range yet to be determined.   G.  The changes below have resulted in a revised Statement of Work (SOW) and Performance Specification, which are attached and available  for downloading.  The SOW and Performance Specification were originally published as Addendum 1, Section 2 and Addendum 1, Section 3 of the solicitation.  The information shown below is only a summary of the changes made to the attached SOW and Performance Specification.

<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes an amendment to Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) N00164-02-R-0014 published on 27 March 2002.  This amendment is intended to alert industry of changes in requirements, schedule, and acquisition strategy previously identified in N00164-02-R-0014   This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program.  A solicitation will be published on or about July of 2002 that seeks to award contracts to vendor(s) who can provide Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) development.  The envisioned development will lead to small arms sighting subsystems that are suitable for special operations combat.  The solicitation will seek Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contractual vehicles to provide both developmental and production items.  In response to market research and user inputs, these may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) with some degree of modification, miniaturization, hardening, or other Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) to be made suitable for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and aiming accessories to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its aiming accessories, current SOPMOD accessories are not effective enough to support optim ized SOF use.  Although the currently fielded aiming devices meet previous performance and design specifications, these devices have exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:  MDNS Development sources are sought for the development of new items or the adaptation of NDI/COTS items that provide miniaturized day and night aiming capabilities to SOF operators.  These MDNS sub-systems have four-fold mission.  MDNS sub-systems, when mounted on small arms, will allow the SOF operator to acquire, identify, and accurately fire on enemy targets in combat.  A secondary mission of these MDNS systems is to provide target observation, illumination, and marking. The developments and improvements required are summariz ed below based on current aiming devices in the SOF inventory.  The below is neither criticism nor endorsement of items in the SOF inventory; rather these current SOF sub-systems are listed as baselines and common reference sub-systems for future measurements of increased performance and effectiveness.   (a) Sub-systems sought:  Detailed requirements will be published in the RCO solicitation.  The following summary improvements to existing fielded systems are desired: Improved/miniaturized versions, or alternative items are sought to replace or supplement the following SOPMOD subsystems, in order of priority:  Group A, Passive Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD), (2) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS), (3) ACOG Reflex Sight (4) ACOG 4X Sight (5) Backup Iron Sight (6) Rail Interface System A(1) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD):   The CNVD integrates standard daylight optics with night vision systems.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed.  The CNVD obviates a nighttime capability shortfall with all standard optical sights, such as the SPR Sight and the AGOG 4x.  The CNVD alleviates risk to operators who must currently remove daylight optics and replace them with night optics at dawn and dusk.  This current scenario, requiring a day sight and a night sight, rather tharagraphs.  4) Paragraph 3.2.21 Exterior Finish:  The requirement for exterior finish was changed from flat dark gray to taupe.  Note: Product samples for the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations are exempt from this requirement.  5) Paragraph 3.3.1.1.1.2.2  Reticle:  Threshold and objective ranges were added to the ballistic compensating reticle.  6) Paragraph 3.3.1.1.1.2.4   Eye Relief:  The ECOS eye relief has been corrected to read 1.4 inches to 3.0 inches.  7) Paragraph 3.3.1.3.1.1.3  Weight:  The CNVD Objective Weight requirement was raised to 22 ounces.  8) Paragraph 3.3.1.3.1.2.1  Scope Compatibility:  The CNVD Scope compatibility table was changed to all APPs.  9) Paragraph 3.3.2.1.1.1.4 Battery Removal:  The requirement for batteries to be able to be replaced by the operator with one hand, without using tools, and without removing the MDNS subsystem from the host weapon was deleted for the VBL III.  10) Paragraph 3.4.1.3 Electromagnetic Performance Parameters:  This paragraph was improperly labeled 3.4.2.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0003 for a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items that was originally issued on 20 February 2003 and is hereby amended as follows:  A.  The date by which offers must be received is changed from 21 APR 03 to 05 MAY 03.  (The closing time, 2:30 pm Eastern Standard Time, is unchanged.)   B.  The clause at FAR 52.225-8 is added.   C.  The Contracting and Management Subfactors for Phase 1, Step 2 and Phase 3, Step 2 of the proposal evaluation process (as set forth in ADDENDUM 3 of the solicitation) are changed to include “Subcontracting”.  The order of the subfactors is therefore changed to:   A.  Past Performance; B.  Schedule; C.  Subcontracting; and D.  Price.   D.  The purpose of the approaching Oral Presentations/Demonstrations is for offerors to provide a presentation concerning the technical aspects of their proposal and to demonst rate their product sample.  The Oral Presentations/Demonstrations shall only address elements related to the offeror’s Technical Proposal (as set forth in Paragraph B. of ADDENDUM 4 to the solicitation).  Past performance, proposed delivery schedules, subcontracting and proposed prices shall not be discussed during Oral Presentations/Demonstrations.   E.  At the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the Government will provide the following 3 items for use by the offerors:  1) A Microsoft compatible computer with CD-ROM; 2) Electronic overhead projection equipment for computer generated presentations; 3) an overhead projector for use with transparencies.   F.  At the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, offerors shall make available to the Government 20 hard copies of their MS PowerPoint presentation.  Offerors are reminded that product samples are not to be submitted with the  proposal on the closing date of this solicitation.  Product samples are to be brought to the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations.  No other contract deliverables (such as operator’s manuals) are required at the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations.   G.  The STRAC Manual referenced in the Performance Specification and other related information may be obtained at the following websites:   http://www.atsc.army.mil/atmd/strac/stracweb.asp  http://www.adtdl.army.mil/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/pam/350-38/chap5.doc  H.  Envelope Drawings for the M4/M203 can be downloaded in PDF format:  \Family_of_M16_rifles.pdf \family_of_m203.pdf \M4_M16_M203 Envelope_drawings.pdf  I.  Delivery Schedules for the following items (as set forth in Addendum 2 of the solicitation) have been changed as shown below:  ITEM No.’s 0005, 0006 and 0007 (MNVS II) are now 120 DAO (Required Delivery Sche dule) / 90 DAO (Objective Delivery Schedule)  ITEM No.’s 0009, 0010 and 0011 (CNVD) are now 120 DAO (Required Delivery Schedule) / 90 DAO (Objective Delivery Schedule)  ITEM No.’s 0025, 0026, and 0027 (CVL II) are now 90 DAO (Required Delivery Schedule) / 60 DAO (Objective Delivery Schedule)  ITEM No.’s 0029, 0030, and 0031 (ITPIAL II) are now 90 DAO (Required Delivery Schedule) /  60 DAO (Objective Delivery Schedule.  J.  The changes below have resulted in a revised Performance Specification, which is attached and available for downloading. The Performance Specification originally published as Addendum 1, Section 3 of the solicitation.  The information show below is only a summary of the changes made to the attached PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION.  PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION CHANGES:  1) Paragraph 3.1.2.5 Power Supplies:  A clause was added to allow for exemptio n to the requirement for batteries to be able to be replaced by the operator with one hand, without using tools, and without removing the MDNS subsystem from the host weapon.  2) Paragraph 3.2.7 Counter-Detection:  The requirement for light emission detection was changed from  5 meters to 10 meters.  3) Paragraph 3.2.14:  This paragraph had inadvertently been skipped over in the previous revision of the performance specification.  This amendment corrects that oversight and renumbers subsequent ptified in Paragraph 7 below by July 19, 2002. (B)  Solicitation is planned to close in August 2002.   Upon the closure date and time of the solicitation, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include, as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  Functional samples to be u sed during the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations will be delivered prior to commencement of the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations.   (C)  Upon closure of the solicitation, a Source Selection Board (SSB) will be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Team (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  An SSB Chairman will be assigned by the SSA to chair the SSB.  All members of the Source Selection Board shall be required to file a Certificate of Non-Disclosure prior to being given access to any of the source selection sensitive material.  A Test Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) will be appointed by the Source Selection Authority (SSA).  The TERP Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.  The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of adjectival voting s cores and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.   Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains technical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.  The CMET will provide the third most important results.  However, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons, or for unreasonable prices.  Ve ndors who propose more rapid delivery schedules, and can prove that they can meet those schedules, will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  (D)  Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, followed by awards will be conducted shortly after the solicitation closes.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors and clarify the offerors’ technical proposals through questioning.  The SSB will require demonstrations, to include functional demonstration and evaluation, during this stage of competition.  Representatives from the user community will be asked to participate.  Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct an adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source  Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award(s).  In order to avoid unreasonable government test costs and lengthy schedules and to maintain efficiency of competition within schedules that are meaningful to current conflicts, the SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety, but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found. (E)  Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.  Product samples are required to comply with key performance parameters (KPP) delineated in the solicitation.  Offerors who submit product samples that do not comply with the KPPs will not be further evaluated.  The samples must meet or exceed the stated thresholds.  These test results and comments will be submitted to the Technical Evaluation Review Panel (TERP). Developmental Testing (DT) will be conducted at NSWC Crane on the product samples to determine compliance with the KPPs, and environmental requirements, and safe to conduct further testing.  Operational Testing (OT) will be conducted by an Independent Validation/Verification Agent.  During OT the operators will determine if the samples meet or exceed the stated thresholds, meet combat suitability and combat effectiveness.  No offerors will be allowed to participate in the OT.  Representatives of the Contracting Officer from NSWC Crane will evaluate offeror(s) past performance and price proposals.  The price evaluation will be presented to the Contracting Officer.  The past performance evaluation will be presented to the TERP. The Contracting Officer/SSA shall use the recommendations and conclusions from the TERP, to include DT and OT analysis, contract management eval uation, past performance, and price evaluations, to derive negotiation strategies and an award determination which will be documented in business clearance memoranda in accordance with the Naval Acquisition Procedure Supplement and NSWC Crane quality assurance guidelines.  The goal is to utilize the same contract vehicles awarded prior to DT/OT for production hardware after this final down-select. 6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this announcement. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government.  The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.  The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or SOPMOD subsystem drawings.  7.

<DESC>Amendment 1 to Sources Sought Synopsis – The government issued a sources sought announcement to identify potential sources and to generate interest in the government’s requirement for  on-site field operation, maintenance services and on-the-job training of various Fleet Air Control and Surveillance Facilities (FACSFAC) sites. As a matter of clarification, the government has not determined, at this time, the specific acquisition strategy by which this requirement will be processed. Correct the original sources sought announcement by deleting the following statement :  “This procurement will be processed under full and open competition; however, the solicitation will include a requirement that 10% of the total value of the resultant requirement be subcontracted to small business firms.”

<DESC>CORRECTION TO CLOSING DATE-THE PHASE I PROPOSAL DUE DATE HAS BEEN CHANGED TO 03 MAR 2004 vs 15 MAR 2004. 
THIS SOLICITATION IS ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS, INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  The project involves all labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision for the design and construction of a Passenger Terminal.  These facilities shall contain shops, ground electronics, air cargo storage, arresting gear, passenger terminal, and administrative spaces.  The approximate size of the Passenger Terminal is 1,226 square meters.  Type of construction is masonry, single story building with standing seam metal roof on pier foundation.  The total estimated value of this acquisition is between $3,000,000 and $3,800,000.  The design and construction requires completion in approximately 365 days.  Proposals will be evaluated using two—phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to a maximum of five offerors, design-build firms or teams, based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications, and Management Approach.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.  The price proposal will be a lump sum price for the project, and may include the evaluation of scope-design options within the Governments published budget for award. The Phase II Technical Factors include Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications of Key Personnel and Technical Solution.  The Government reserves the right to-reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVUALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms. Proposers should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR SPECIFICATIONS OR DOCUMENTATION. The Government intends to issue the Phase I Request for Proposals, RFP, electronically by posting it on the NAVFAC website, http://esol.navfac.navy.mil on or about 11 February 2004.   Offerors must register on the Internet at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Phase I proposals will be due on or about 15 March 2004.  In Phase II, RFP will be posted on the NAVFAC web site for viewing and downloading, although the download time may be excessive. Copies of a compact disk, CD ROM, of the Phase II plans and specifications may be purchased from the Defense Automated Printing Service, DAPS, in Charleston, SC. The Point of Contact at DAPS is Paula Brooks at 843-743-2500, ext. 24. The FAX Number for DAPS is 843-743-2505.  The official plan holders list will be maintained on and may be printed from the web site.  Amendments will be posted on the web site for downloading.  This will be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.  Offerors MUST also be registered in the Contractors Central Registration, CCR in order to participate in this procurement. The website for CCR is http://www.ccr.gov.  For inquiries about the date of receipt of proposals or the number of amendments, contact Shirley Shumer at 843-820-5923.

<DESC>Modification 01: Delete the following from the original notice: The proposed contract listed here is 100 percent small business set-aside. The Government will only accept offers from small business concerns. Add the following: The proposed solicitation is set-aside for certified HUBZone small business firms listed on the Small Business Adminstration (SBA) List of Qualified HUBZone Small Business Concerns on its Internet website at http://www.sba.gov/hubzone. The Government will only accept offers from SBA certified HUBZone small business concerns. Status as a qualified HUBZone small business concern is determined by the SBA in accordance with 13 CFR Part 126. If the SBA determines that a concern is a qualified HUBZone small business concern, it will issue a certification to that effect and will add the concern to the List of Qualified HUBZone Small Business Concerns on its Internet website at http://www.sba.gov/hubzone. All other information publicized in the original notice is correct. 

Original:  Grounds and Tree Maintenance Services for Central/West Oahu, Hawaii.  The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, quality control, safety prevention, tools, materials, equipment, and transportation necessary to provide grounds and tree maintenance services and other incidental work.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is replacing the Standard Industry Code Classification (SIC).  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 56173 (previously SIC Code 0782) and the annual size standard is $5 Million.  The contract is a combination firm fixed-price/indefinite quantity contract.  Parts of the contract requirements will be full performance-based service contracting, where the Contractor shall have full responsibility to perform the services using their own and industry best practices and processes to ensure that specified outcomes are achieved.  The contract term will be a base period of one year plus four option years.  The total term of the contract, including all options, will not exceed 60 months.  If the Government does not award a follow-on contract in time, the Government may require the Contractor to continue performance for an additional period up to six months under the Option to Extend Services clause.  In either case, the Government will not synopsize the options when exercised. This contract will replace a contract for similar services awarded in 2000 for $1,056,000.00 (firm fixed-price) and $143,105.00 (indefinite quantity) per year.  We will include information about the current contract and the incumbent contractor (e.g., value of last option exercised, firm name, address, etc.) with the solicitation package.  We do not require requests under the Freedom of Information Act for this information.  Offerors can view and/or download the solicitation at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil when it becomes available.  The proposed contract listed here is 100 percent small business set-aside.  The Government will only accept offers from small business concerns.  The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures, which require offerors to submit a Technical and Price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  Proposal receipt date is approximate.

<DESC>PLEASE QUOTE THE ITEMS LISTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATEMENT OF WORK OR EQUIVALENT ITMES.  


Please provide a quote for the following Statement of Work.  The Line Items of the Purchase Request and the Attachment 1 referenced in the Statement of Work are also provided below.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


1.0	Background:

This Statement of Work (SoW) provides for the DEFENSE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AGENCY (DISA) to contract for a one-time purchase of the products identified, in the respective quantities indicated, in the Line Items of the Purchase Request.

As part of this solicitation, the Government seeks to obtain consideration, in the form of credits and/or discounted pricing, for the excess items listed in Attachment 1.  

Vendors should be aware that proposals that do not offer a reduced price incentive, in exchange for the excess items, may be less effectively competitive, since the Government will evaluate each proposal based on the final cost after the application of credits and/or discounts, in order to achieve a Best Value selection. 

2.0	Government Responsibilities:

A Government Point-of-Contact (POC) will be assigned to answer questions, relating to this solicitation, as may be required.
	
a.	Prior to the closing date of the solicitation, the Government will make the excess items available, for bidder’s inspection, in order that the vendor can determine the amount of any price incentive they would like to incorporate into their proposal.

b.	The Government will provide the required documentation for release or transfer of the items to the vendor whose proposal is selected.

3.0	Task Requirements:

Unless otherwise indicated, excess items are currently located at the Defense Enterprise Computing Center Detachment San Antonio (DECC Det-SA), 450 Duncan Drive, KellyUSA, San Antonio, TX  78226-1834.  

a.	Prior to the closing date of the solicitation, the vendor may schedule an appointment to inspect, in person, any of the excess items by contacting the designated Points-of-Contact (POCs) listed in section 5.0.

The Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation on or about February 25, 2004 that is most advantageous to the Government.  This is a total small business set aside, the NAICS code is 334519 (Vibration meters, analyzers and calibrators Mfg) and the size standard is 500 employees.   FPDS Code is 6680 - Liquid/gas  motion measuring equipment. VENDORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT QUOTES ELECTRONICALLY.  They may also be faxed to the attention of Marie Day at 208-383-2237 or mailed to Bureau of Reclamation, 230 Collins Road, Boise, ID  83702. Technical questions regarding this solicitation can be directed to Ernie Bachman at 208-383-2270.  To take advantage of business opportunities with BOR and DOI vendors must register their firm on the Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) @ http://www.ccr.gov. PROXIMITY PROBES-FORWARD The following design data and technical specifications are required for a contract to supply eddy-current proximity transducers (probes), probe drivers (oscillator-demodulators), associated cable, and probe driver housings for Hydroelectric Units 1 - 3 at Boise Diversion Powerplant, Snake River Area Office.     These three hydro units, which are currently being rehabilitated,  have fluid film guide and thrust bearings and operate at a speed of  240 rpm (4 Hz).   At the present time we plan on installing the proximity probes for commissioning the re-furbished units and for future monitoring.   We do not plan on purchasing a full monitoring system at this time, but will use a temporary portable system, connected to these probes, to collect shaft run-out data during the start-up and testing of the units.   The probes will be permanently installed and in the future we may purchase a full system, compatible with these probes.   After commissioning, they will continue to provide critical data for rough zone operation, as well as indicating bearing wear and clearances, and general operating condition of the rotating machinery. The mechanical monitoring will include measuring radial shaft vibration (run-out) and orbits at  three guide bearings, two of which are water-lubricated and are submerged under water.  The unit shafts are constructed of forged steel.   The proximity probes will be used as follows per hydrogenerator unit:  3 pairs used as X-Y dual vibration transducers located at the lower turbine guide bearing, the upper turbine guide bearing, and the lower generator guide bearing of each unit. We will install two probes at each bearing location, for a total of six per unit.  The two probes mounted on the bottom bearing will require 12 meters of un-interrupted cable, directly connected to the probes for submerged operation.   This is not a normal industry standard. For the two probes at the middle guide bearing, the industry-standard, 9 meter cable length, will be sufficient, but the cable will also need to be un-interrupted  for submerged operation.  This, also, is not a normal industry standard.  The two probes at the upper guide bearing will be in a dry location, and may use the industry-standard 9-meter cable system.   SECTION A - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS  SUBSECTION A.1 - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS A.1.1		 This specification describes transducers  for the measurement of shaft displacement, run-out, and orbits on vertical hydroelectric generating units.  This transducer equipment is to be furnished by the Contractor.  The equipment is to be installed by government forces at Boise Diversion Powerplant,  Snake River Area Office. A.1.2		Submittal Requirements Three complete sets of manuals describing the installation, operation, and maintenance of the transducers shall be .furnished by the contractor after award.

I. SAFETY/OSHA VIOLATIONS

1.  OSHA PROBLEM:  
Engine stand lighting obstructing walkway path (stands 19 2ea, 20 2ea).  Lighting poses a stepping/tripping hazard.

Reference:
CFR 1910.22 AND AFOSH 91-501 7.2.1.2. Dangerous Surface Condition. Cracks or holes, protruding nails, broken surface materials, slippery finishes, surfaces of different elevations, and improper design for the use intended.

2.  OSHA PROBLEM: 
Each engines thrust reverser (TR) should have thinner split slides (each engine).  Opening causes a fall hazard 

Reference:
1910.66 Appendix C Mandatory Fall Protection  
AFOSH 91-501 para 13.1

3.  OSHA PROBLEM: 
By deleting stands 2 and 22 you create additional fall protection issues on upper levels stand 3 and 23 

Reference:
1910.66 Appendix C Mandatory Fall Protection And 
AFOSH 91-501 para 13.1

4.  OSHA PROBLEM:  
Wing access ladders (stands 8/28, 4/24) C-channel protrudes from supports and retraction lanyard pose a hazard.

Reference:
AFOSH 91-501 7.2.1.2. Dangerous Surface Condition. Cracks or holes, protruding nails, broken surface materials, slippery finishes, surfaces of different elevations, and improper design for the use intended.


5.  OSHA PROBLEM: 
Stands 8/28, wing access ladders do not have sufficient clearance from railing (AFOSH standard) restricts egress from stands to hangar floor.

Reference:
CFR 1910.36(g)(2) An exit access must be at least 28 inches (71.1 cm) wide at all points. Where there is only one exit access leading to an exit or exit discharge, the width of the exit and exit discharge must be at least equal to the width of the exit access.

6.  OSHA PROBLEM: 
Configuring engine cowl doors for ISO inspection results in trailing edge wing stand to have unacceptable gaps that pose tripping and fall hazard to workers.

Reference:
OSHA 1910.23(b)(5) AND AFOSH 91-501 7.2.1.2. Dangerous Surface Condition. Cracks or holes, protruding nails, broken surface materials, slippery finishes, surfaces of different elevations, and improper design for the use intended.

7.  OSHA PROBLEM: 
Stands 11/31 slides present a fall protection hazard (gaps) that are tripping and falling hazard to workers.

Reference:
OSHA 1910.23(b)(5) AND AFOSH 91-501 7.2.1.2. Dangerous Surface Condition. Cracks or holes, protruding nails, broken surface materials, slippery finishes, surfaces of different elevations, and improper design for the use intended.

 8.  OSHA PROBLEM: 
Stands 10/30 do not have sufficient walkway with slats extended.  Restricts egress along the leading edge of the wing.

Reference:
CFR 1910.36(g)(2) An exit access must be at least 28 inches (71.1 cm) wide at all points. Where there is only one exit access leading to an exit or exit discharge, the width of the exit and exit discharge must be at least equal to the width of the exit access.
CFR 1910.36(g)(3) The width of an exit route must be sufficient to accommodate the maximum permitted occupant load of each floor served by the exit route.
CFR 1910.36(g)(4) Objects that project into the exit route must not reduce the width of the exit route to less than the minimum width requirements for exit routes. 

9.  OSHA PROBLEM:  
Tripping hazard from the stairs to the working platform of the engine maintenance stands.  

Reference:
AFOSH 91-501 7.2.1.2. Dangerous Surface Condition. Cracks or holes, protruding nails, broken surface materials, slippery finishes, surfaces of different elevations, and improper design for the use intended.


II.  NON- SAFETY ITEMS REQUIRED TO IMPROVE FUNCTIONALITY OF STAND

     1.  Build a 30” x 60” x 120” panel bin and mount on the forward of stands 6, 8, 26 and 28 to replace the rails.

     2.  Replace all bumpers that can cover entire slide (individual).  Pictured below is applicable type of bumper pad.

     3.  Relocate electrical boxes to the outside of railing (will not protrude into stand work area).

     4.  Remove knee brace on stands 18 and 33 and mount pad to allow sufficient space forlanding gear door.

     5.  Replacement of existing air adapters with Air Force standard air adapters. 
          Note: Call out of AF standard air adapters will be identified upon site review.

This information is required in writing, and failure to provide information on any of the criteria above (#1 through #6) may result in your firm being excluded from further consideration. 

Please limit your responses to no more than 25 pages.  Information must be received by March 15, 2004.  Information packages consisting of 10 pages or less can be faxed to the attention of Sherry Eash, Sr. Subcontract Specialist, at 301/ 846-6541.  Packages of more than 10 pages should be sent to the attention of Ms. Eash at SAIC Frederick, Inc., P.O. Box B, Frederick, MD 21702-1201. 

Upon closing of the submission period, information packages will be reviewed against the qualifications listed above, and down-selected to the most qualified companies to provide the required services.  The companies not selected will be notified in writing that they did not survive the down-selection process.  The remaining companies will receive a Request for Proposal (RFP) package for a single Time and Materials (T&M), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) subcontract for demolition and construction.  SAIC-Frederick reserves the right to make no award.  

The proposed procurement will be issued as a T&M, ID/IQ solicitation.  The scope of work includes, but is not limited to, demolition, modification, and/or construction build-back.  Individual task orders will be issued on a T&M basis.  Price rates for various labor classifications will be pre-established.  Tasks will be awarded with the intent that work will begin in earnest within two (2) working days of receiving SAIC-Frederick approval of staffing levels and composition, and a ramp-up plan for the assigned task.  Work will be under the general supervision of an SAIC-Frederick employee (Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative, COTR); however specific labor supervision will remain the responsibility of the Subcontractor.  Due to the nature and the need for expeditious response for the majority of the demolition and build back construction services, the selected Subcontractor will be required to maintain a staffed office within one hundred (100) mile proximity of Ft. Detrick, and will be expected to obtain all necessary permits for work accomplished at any off-campus locations.  SAIC Frederick will not directly reimburse the Seller for costs associated with staffing and maintaining this office.  The acquisition includes a base period of approximately sixteen (16) months, with two 1-year option periods, if exercised, for a total duration of forty (40) months.  The estimated maximum dollar value for the first year and each of the option years is $500,000.  The guaranteed minimum dollar amount for the first year and each of the option years is $0.  The maximum individual order limitation will be $50,000.00, and the minimum individual dollar limitation will be $1,000.00.  

This sources sought notice is step 1 of a 2-step procurement, and should not be construed in any manner to be an obligation on SAIC Frederick’s part to issue a subcontract, or result in any claim for reimbursement of costs for any effort you expend in responding to this request.

<RESPDATE>060102
<CONTACT>Donald Ellison, Contracting Officer, 812-854-5774, FAX 812-854-5095
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes a Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) and a synopsis of an upcoming solicitation.  This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program.  A solicitation will be published on or about April or May of 2002 that seeks to award contracts to vendor(s) who can provide Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) development.  The envisioned development will lead to small arms sighting subsystems that are suitable for special operations combat.  The solicitation will seek Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contractual vehicles to provide both developmental an d production items.  These may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), however previous market research indicates that all items of interest will require some degree of modification, miniaturization, hardening, or other Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) to be made suitable for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and aiming accessories to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its aiming accessories, current SOPMOD accessories are not effective enough to support optimized SOF use.  Although the currently fielded aiming devices meet previous performance and design specifications, these devices ha ve exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:  MDNS Development sources are sought for the development of new items or the adaptation of NDI/COTS items that provide miniaturized day and night aiming capabilities to SOF operators. MDNS sub-systems, when mounted on small arms, will allow the SOF operator to acquire, identify, and accurately fire on enemy targets in combat.  A secondary mission of these MDNS systems is to provide target observation, illumination, and marking. The developments and improvements required are summarized below based on current aiming devices in the SOF inventory.  The below is neither criticism nor endorsement of items in the SOF inventory; rather these current SOF sub-systems ar e listed as baselines and common reference sub-systems for future measurements of increased performance and effectiveness.   (a) Sub-systems sought:  Detailed requirements will be published in the RCO solicitation.  The following summary improvements to existing fielded systems are desired…Improved/miniaturized versions, or alternative items are sought to replace or supplement the following SOPMOD subsystems, in order of priority:  Group A, Passive Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) 3.5X-10X and 2.5X-8X SPR Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) Sights, (2) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD), (3) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS), (4) ACOG Reflex Sight (5) ACOG 4X Sight  A(1) 3.5X-10X and 2.5X-8X Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) Sights: improved day/night aiming capability, miniaturization, better resistance to fogging in rain and high humidity conditions, improved instantane ous sighting capabilities, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, improved stadiametric aiming capability (improved mil-dot/stadia line characteristics at all power settings), size and weight reductions, improved reticle illumination (illumination of entire reticle), reticle magnification to match scope power adjustments (first focal plane reticle), range and bullet drop compensation adjustments visible on the reticle both day and night, spirit level or cant indicator at base of reticle, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and lower power settings suitable for Close Quarters Battle (CQB) operations.  Presently, there are no IDIQ contracts for 3.5X-10X SPR Riflescope Sights.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(2) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD):  The CNVD integr ates standard daylight optics with night vision systems.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed.  The CNVD obviates a nighttime capability shortfall with all standard optical sights, such as the SPR Sight and the AGOG 4x.  The CNVD alleviates risk to operators who must currently remove daylight optics and replace them with night optics at dawn and dusk.  This current scenario, requiring a day sight and a night sight, rather than a day sight combined with a CNVD, exposes operators to enemy detection due to movement involved with changing the sights and leaves operators with unsighted weapons during changeover.  Further, the current methodology cannot guarantee repeatable zero after changing from day to night optics.  Improved performance in fog, dust, extreme darkness, foliage is also desired for the CNVD.  There are presently no IDIQ contracts for CNVD. The SOPMOD Program has  a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(3) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS): While CNVD is the primary night vision system sought for future small arms, certain small arms remain more suitably served by dedicated night vision sights.  For these applications, an MNVS or similar alternative is required with ruggedization for use on the following platforms:  M14, M16, M249, M60, Mk11, Mk43, Mk46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, M2 .50 Caliber MG, and .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.  A variant is required with increased magnification power capability to include 4X-6X, improved resistance to fogging in rain, high humidity, and extreme temperatures, improved performance in fog, foliage, dust, and extreme low light, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, weight reduction, reduced snag hazard, decrease supportability costs, improved  reliability, improved platform mounting flexibility, improved protection for lenses, reticle upgrades, and instantaneous backup sighting capability.  The current contract for the MNVS will expire in FY 2003. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(4) ACOG Reflex:  improved performance in high humidity and rain, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, night vision upgrades, improved target acquisition for quicker engagement, miniaturization, reduced snag hazard, and improved performance of aiming dot in all lighting conditions.  The present contract for the ACOG Reflex has expired.  A recent contract has been established for the ECOS-N (Maritime Aim Point), however it also could benefit by improvement or replacement to achieve enhanced performance in rain and high humidity, reduce d snag hazard, incorporation of emergency backup sight, and size and weight reduction.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(5) ACOG 4X: improved performance in high humidity and rain, ergonomic improvement for use with backup iron sights, night vision upgrades, improved interoperability with night vision goggles, reticle illumination adjustment, improved eye relief, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and simplification of reticle pattern.  The present contract for the ACOG 4X has expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this 4X capability with a variable, switchable, or stacked sight that allows improved sighting both at close and long range.  Group B, Activ e Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Visible Bright Light (VBL), (2) Integrated Pointer/Illuminator Module (IPIM), (3) AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Laser Pointer/Illuminator (ITPIAL), (4) AN/PEQ-5 Carbine Visible Laser (CVL) B(1)  VBL: Ruggedization, weight and size reduction, reduced snag hazard, improved reliability when used in automatic fire, and a variety that provides for combination of Infra-red and white light capability into one module. Existing contracts for the VLI will expire in FY 2002. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(2) IPIM: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance/reflectivity of visible lasers against green and black targets, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the IPIM have expired.  T he SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.   B(3) ITPIAL: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, pattern and pulse capabilities, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the ITPIAL have expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(4) CVL:  Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance with green and black targets, improved compatibility with laser eye protection, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the CVL have expired. The SOPMOD Program desires to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines th is capability into a unified system, such as IPIM above. (b) Performance and Research Objectives Common to All Sub-systems:  The SOPMOD program is not seeking alternate sources for the currently fielded SOPMOD equipment named above, rather is seeking alternative sub-systems with the following improved operational performance characteristics as research objectives: (1) increased User Acceptance to include: improved operational suitability, improved performance in semi-automatic and full automatic fire, increased range, snag free in movement through vegetation and battlefield obstacles.  Increased hit scores by SOF operators during day, night, rain, mist, smoke, vegetation, fog, dust, and extreme low light conditions (2) miniaturization, including reductions in both size and weight, with an objective of increased weapon portability and better weapon balance during the act of fir ing (3) increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, ease of cleaning, (4) fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds threshold, 30,000 rounds objective, (5) functional reliability exceeding that of the present subsystems at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf/temperature shock) environmental conditions (6) recoil shock endurance sufficient to allow use on all SOF small arms (7) improved safety, (8) low optical augmentation retro-reflection, (9) improved lens performance in rain, fog, snow, dust, and other atmospheric conditions, e.g. transparent sacrificial lens covers, (10) decreased life-cycle support costs.  5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method.  Items will be selected on a “Best Value” Contracting basis.  IDIQ contracts will be awarded t o offerors in accordance with the following plan:   (A) RCO Solicitation is to be published on or about April or May 2002.  The RCO solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Please do not respond to this advisory announcement until such time as the RCO solicitation is published.    (B) Solicitation is planned to close on or about May or June 2002.  Upon the closure date and time, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include, as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  A Source Selection Panel will evaluate the technical proposals, screening them to establish the competitive range.  A Source Selection Board (SSB) will be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Tea m (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  A Test and Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.   The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of adjectival voting scores and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.  Also, an SSB Chairman will be assigned by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) to chair the SSB.  Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains tech nical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.   The CMET will provide the third most important results.  However, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons, or for unreasonable prices.  Vendors who propose more rapid delivery schedules, and can prove that they can meet those schedules, will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  This project seeks to field equipment in a time frame that is relevant to current conflicts.  Delivery of first articles is August 2002 (Objective), and March 2003 (Threshold).  Offerors of proposals found to be in the competitive range will be invited to renovate their proposals based on S SB findings, and to proceed to the next stage of competition, which will be Oral Presentation/Demonstration.   (C) Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, followed by awards will be conducted on or about June or July 2002, at a location to be announced.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors in the competitive range and clarify the offerors’ technical proposals through questioning.  The SSB may opt to require demonstrations, to include live-fire demonstration and evaluation, during this stage of competition.  Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct a second adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award.  In order to avoid unreasonable governmen t test costs and lengthy schedules and to maintain efficiency of competition within schedules that are meaningful to current conflicts, the SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety, but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found.   (D) Follow-on Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.   6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this announcement. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government.  The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.  The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or SOPMOD subsystem  drawings.   7.

BACKGROUND:  

The Inspector General Department of Defense (IG DoD) is currently implementing a long-range strategy to conduct audits of DoD financial statements. Agency financial statements are required by the Chief Financial Officer’s Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-576), which mandates agencies prepare financial statements and subsequent audits of the financial statements. For a sample of financial statements and related reports, go to http://www.dodig.osd.mil/audit/reports/03report.htm and select reports D-2003-050, D-2003-047, D-2003-042.

The Department’s financial statements must cover all accounts and associated activities of each office, bureau, and activity of each component within the DoD.  The IG DoD must verify the reliability of agency financial statements through the use of audits and other methods.  Currently, the Department’s financial statements are being developed using various financial management systems throughout the DoD.  The reliability of these systems directly impacts the DoD’s ability to produce reliable financial statements.  

The IG DoD is committed to increasing the resources devoted to auditing the financial statements, and the related financial management business activities.  The IG DoD’s strategy is intended to facilitate the Department’s commitment to improve financial management and attain auditable financial statements that support an unqualified opinion.  To accomplish this strategy, NAVAIR intends to issue a subsequent RFI to conduct CFO audits, Statement of Auditing Standards 70/88 Reviews of DoD Service Organizations, Assessment of DoD Financial Management Systems, Audit Readiness Assessments, and Remediation Plans.  Commercial sources may include but are not limited to Independent Public Accounting Firms (IPA’s) and Information Technology (IT) firms.

Sources are sought to conduct reliability assessments of DoD Financial Management Systems including related operations, activities, functions, and processes, used to compile and prepare the DoD’s financial statements.  The assessments will also determine whether internal controls over financial reporting are in place and operating as intended.  

A reliability assessment is a preliminary evaluation to determine if an entity’s financial statements can withstand a full-scale audit and is a means by which to identify significant issues, if any, that may preclude the performance of a full-scale financial statement audit.  The specific services required for each type of assessment will be reflected in individual statements of work for each task order.

A performance work statement will be developed on a cases-by-case basis describing the technical requirements, and functional performance requirements and the nature and type of service(s) needed.

The reliability assessments, in some instances, must conform to Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) [http://www.gao.gov/govaud/yb2003.pdf] and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) standards.  However, individual task orders with a limited objective may be issued that do not require compliance with GAGAS or the AICPA standards.  The IG DoD will monitor the contractor’s work through the use of periodic contractor reporting and ongoing access to contractor’s working papers.  The IG DoD will also determine whether the contractor’s work complies with GAGAS and that the work supports the assessment conclusions.  Task order contracts will be issued with variable performance timeframes reflected in each order.  It is envisioned that IPA or IT firms with IG DoD oversight can conduct the reliability assessments. 

Contract Objective(s).  The overall program objective is to determine whether various DoD financial statements, taken as a whole, are accurately presented in all material respects, and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Specifically, individually awarded task orders will determine the accuracy and reliability of various DoD Financial Management Systems, including related processes, activities, functions, operations, policies, and procedures involved in the compilation and preparation of agency financial statements.   

CAPABILITY STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS:

An interested party should be able to demonstrate, in any capability statements submitted, experience with evaluating information systems in terms of fulfillment of purpose, design efficiency, appropriate controls, data integrity, integration with external systems, and human interface.  NAVAIR-AD intends to award one or more contracts to have access to the full range of expertise required. Experience may include, both government and commercial work that the offeror has performed.  Demonstrated evidence may include, but not be limited to customer names and addresses, description of work performed/delivered, description of types/complexity of systems worked on, description of strategies to accomplish the work, description of communication strategies with the customer, and significant accounting and information technology issues resolved.  If applicable, highlight any work performed with accounting/financial management systems and/or government information systems (include contract numbers).  Interested parties should be able to demonstrate their ability to perform these evaluations with only personnel that are U.S. citizens.  Finally, offerors should include an analytical comparison of their capability in terms of the services requested by this RFI.   

RESPONSES TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SHOULD CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

1) A 3-5 page summary of the contractor’s “relevant” prior work; 2) description of any potential conflicts of interest the offeror may have in performing the work, and insight and solutions to contractor firewalls and Organizational Conflicts of Interest as it relates to current efforts as well as services provided under future RFIs/contracts related to this program, 3) A brief description of the contractor’s quality control processes for deliverables; 4) references (names and contact information) for whom the contractor has performed similar work, 5) a one-page corporate summary including your web site, 6) a listing of any current negotiated GSA  schedule, government contract, or commercial pricing rates, and 7) a statement identifying if the offeror is a small business, 8(a) firm, small disadvantaged business, women-owned business, or HUBZone firm.

This is a Request For Information announcement only. This is not a request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on the submission to this RFI nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement.

Written capability statements must be submitted no later than February 26, 2004 to:

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC) Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) Integrated Product Team (IPT) under the Area Attack Program Office, AAC/YH, is contemplating a sole source award to Textron Systems Corp., 201 Lowell Street, Wilmington MA 01887.  It is anticipated that only one source, Textron Systems Corp., Wilmington MA, developer of the SFW, can satisfy the Government’s minimum needs for this unique weapon system.  It is the government intent to award a Long Term Pricing Agreement (LTPA) to cover a five-year time period starting in FY 06 through FY 10.  This production effort will be done under a follow on to competition with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) for specified quantities, to include data, thru the next five years of production.  The SFW CBU-105B/B (NSN 1325-01-458-4828) is a 1,000-pound class, unpowered, unguided, gravity-drop wide area munition.  The SFW consists of a SUU-66/B tactical munitions dispenser, which houses 10 BLU-108B/B submunitions.  Each submunition contains four projectiles, an orientation and stabilization system, a radar altimeter, and a rocket motor.  Each projectile contains an explosively formed penetrator warhead and a two-color infrared sensor.  The SFW is stored and transported as an all-up round in the CNU-411A/E container.  It is intended that award be made for options of the eleventh Full Rate Production (FRP) annual buy through the fifteenth FRP annual buy for the procurement of full-up CBUs and data.  This effort requires contractor personnel be cleared for access to SECRET NOFORN.  In accordance with DODD 5230.25, potential contractors must be certified and registered for STINFO export control by the Defense Logistic Service Center (DLSC), Battle Creek MI  49016-3412, telephone number 800-352-3572, to receive any resultant Request for Proposal (RFP).

<SUBJECT>65 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  
The items proposed are: Purple Nitrile Examination Gloves - Ambidextrous, powder free, and 100% synthetic nitrile polymer medical grade glove for individuals who are allergic to natural rubber or latex. (6515-00-NIB-0241 - Size Small; 6515-00-NIB-0242 - Size Medium; 6515-00-NIB-0243 - Size Large; 6515-00-NIB-0244 - Size XLarge).  In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>A -- Advanced Computional Electromagnetics (ACE) Workshop
<DESC>Advanced Computational Electromagnetics (ACE) Workshop, SN04-14.  The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring an informational gathering workshop for a possible new DARPA ACE program. This potential program would undertake development and validation of new approaches for electromagnetic scattering prediction relevant to radar cross-section (RCS) design of surface ships.  Specific foundational challenges to be addressed in the anticipated ACE program are: (1) Prediction of scattering from rough and/or dynamic surfaces;  (2) Incremental updating of previously computed solutions when the geometry or material properties of a scatterer are perturbed; (3) Hybridization of techniques to efficiently handle scatterers having defined regions with different characteristics (e.g., scale of geometrical detail, types of materials); and (4) Quantitative propagation of uncertainties in properties of the scatterer and illumination  to uncertainties in the scattering prediction. The workshop will be held March 29, 2004 at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Pentagon City in Arlington, VA. The workshop goals are: (a) introduce the relevant research and practitioner communities in academia, industry, and Government to the ACE program vision and goals, and (b) promote formation of teams having capabilities to develop new mathematical and computational methodologies, design benchmark applications for the evaluation of these new approaches, and foster their insertion into the practice of designing ships and other military vehicles. The workshop will include overview presentations by Government personnel and poster sessions preceded by summary overviews to facilitate interaction and team forming among the participants.  Appropriate teaming will be a critical element in responding to an anticipated DARPA ACE solicitation in summer 2004.  Participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters and three-minute summary overview presentations describing areas of capabilities and interest to facilitate communications, interactions and teaming discussions.  A short abstract of each poster presentation is required.  Explicit instructions for preparation and submission of these materials, as well as workshop details including registration information, are given on the ACE workshop website: http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/Index.asp?meetingid=241.  The workshop registration fee is $165.00 and includes all workshop activities.  Registration is limited by the venue capacity and early registration is strongly recommended.  The registration cutoff date is Wednesday, March 17, 2004 or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.  DARPA anticipates, but cannot guarantee, that a solicitation will follow the workshop. Further administrative information is available from Mara Scheele (mscheele@snap.org). Additional technical information can be obtained from Douglas Cochran (dcochran@darpa.mil).  Please refer to the ACE Workshop in correspondence.
