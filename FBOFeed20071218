Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of Network Appliance support for existing SAN equipment at BIMC.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/II owns and has in use Network Appliance SAN equipment.  As part of CA/CSTýs migration from CLASS to eCLASS, CST purchased and installed 4 Storage Area Networks (SANs) from Network Appliances (NetApp).  The support for the hardware expires on 10/31/2007.  The SAN equipment, however, is still in use and is an essential part to CA/CST/II operations.  By extending the support for the equipment, CA can ensure that Network Appliance will provide premium 7x24 hour onsite support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. Due to CAýs investment and overall satisfaction with the Network Appliance SAN equipment and the service that Network Appliance provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.  CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Network Appliance SAN.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governmentýs best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.<BR><BR>

The workstations must have FireWire capability in order to support our 10-print fingerprint scanners.  The scanners require 1.5 amps at 12 volts which not all FireWire cards can provide. The HP SFF machines require customized wiring integration from the power source of the PC to the FireWire card.  While the required power can be technically provided within the computer or external to the computer, we have determined that external power solutions are not desired due to cable disconnection issues, breakage, space, clutter, an additional point of failure, need for dual voltage and the need for additional power sockets.  Internal solutions are therefore necessary.   For support purposes (workstation imaging, troubleshooting, installation and training) we need to limit the variety of PC models in the field.  We need to stay with proven manufacturers such as Dell and HP that offer some worldwide support and assistance.  Minimum workstation requirements: ý	DVD-ROM ý	Small Form Factor (H: 17ý x W: 6ý x D: 15ý) ý	One analog 15-pin video or DVI video connection with analog adapter ý	One serial port ý	Six USB 2.0 ports after connecting mouse and keyboard ý	One expansion slot ý	One Unibrain FireWire card custom wired to the PC power supply ý	Integrated NIC 10/100/1000 with full ASF 2.0 and PXE support ý	Minimum of 2 GG of Dual Channel DRR2 shared memory ý	Windows XP Professional ý	Dual core processor or better ý	Integrated graphic card with minimum of 128 MB video RAM ý	Energy Star compliant. Prefer 110/220 auto switchable ý	SATA II 80 GB Hard drive minimum ý	2.6 GHz, Dual core processor or better ý	Integrated sound card with minimum 1 stereo in, 2 stereo out ports: one for head phone and one for desktop speakers FireWire card:  We investigated a few of the popular FireWire cards on the market (Adaptec, Siig and Unibrain) and chose the Unibrain Fireboard Blue card (Part No. 1203) with the low profile bracket (Part No 1222).  Two distinct requirements for the FireWire card are that it cannot pull power from the PCI bus (this is an issue with the small form factor machines) and it must have a 6-pin connection that allows for 1.5 amps at 12 volts of direct current. Adaptec is completely dropping their FireWire line of products and Siig confirmed that all their FireWire cards are fused at 1 amp, which cannot support our needs.<BR><BR>Workstation-specific issues   Investigation of workstations revealed that the 12 volt line on the PCI bus (Peripheral Component Interconnect - An extremely common and widely used computer bus) is insufficiently rated to supply power to the scanners.  This means that additional power must be available from a source able to supply sufficient current.  This can be achieved by a properly designed embedded Firewire port, but no systems were made available with embedded Firewire while meeting all other applicable requirements as defined above.  This, in effect, means a direct connection to the system power supply is required.  Normally this is achieved by standard connectors found in the computer, but the units meeting the small form factor requirements do not have appropriate available connectors.   The HP dc7700 SFF workstation has two available power connectors, one SATA (serial advanced technology attachment) connection and one floppy disk drive power connection. The floppy disk drive power connection is the appropriate choice to connect to the FireWire card, but the wires are too short to reach. No standard peripheral power connectors are present in this workstation. Custom integration wiring: The HP solution is an HP dc7700 PC meeting all applicable specifications which has been modified by the addition and installation of a Startech connector and a low-profile UniBrain Fireboard Blue.  	Startech Part No.: LP4SP4SATAFM 	UniBrain Fireboard Blue Part No.: 1203 	UniBrain Low Profile adapter Part No: 1222 Design modifications were made by Startech and a custom part No. LP4SP4SATAFM was produced, which was accepted as a solution to this issue. The SATA power connector on the Startech part needs to be connected to the available Sata power connector on the HP 7700. The floppy drive power connector on the Startech part must be attached to the Unibrain firewire card. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet our biometrics collection requirement.<BR><BR>CA is standardizing on one workstation type (small form factor (NTE H: 17ý x W: 6ý x D: 15ý) to meet our needs at our consular windows (where space and power supply issues are a concern) and on the desktop.

Normally this is achieved by standard connectors found in the computer, but the units meeting the small form factor requirements do not have appropriate available connectors.   The Dell OptiPlex GX 745 SFF workstation uses only three standard power connectors, all of which are in use. These connectors are one 24-pin ATX (advanced technology extended) power connector, one 4-pin ATX12V (ATX 12 volt) connector, and a single SATA power connector. Additionally, one non-standard power connector was used to power the CD-ROM disc drive. This leaves no connectors free to power additional devices and no easy path to insert a line splitter. Custom integration wiring: Dell based their solution on a suggestion of Insulation Displacement type connectors.  This solution adds a highly standard connector to existing cabling, and is a generally applicable solution to a lack of connectors.  In addition to our configuration requirements for the Dell Optiplex GX745 SFF above the following parts are required in each system in addition to applicable tooling for installation: -Insulation Displacement connector and back plate:  AMP (formerly Tyco) 770233-1 and AMP 770156-3 or equivalent pair -UniBrain Fireboard Blue Part No.: 1203 -UniBrain Low Profile adapter Part No: 1222 Please note: If performed by an integrator other than Dell then the IDC solution may have a negative impact on the system warranty, and if power supplies are replaced then modifications will need to be made to them using the Insulation Displacement Connectors listed above with appropriate tooling. To configure, the power cables that connect to the hard disk drive need to be disconnected and the cables need to be separated. Using a plastic insulation displacement connector the wires need to be arranged in accordance with the numbers on the side of the connector. Using a crimp tool, the insulation displacement connector needs to be crimped and the connectorýs dust cover attached. The power cable must then be connected to the insulation displacement connector and then connected to the FireWire card.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet our biometrics collection requirement.<BR><BR>

For the Windows XP settings, see http://csrc.nist.gov/itsec/guidance_WinXP.html and for the Windows Vista settings, see: http://csrc.nist.gov/itsec/guidance_vista.html. (b) The standard installation, operation, maintenance, update, and/or patching of software shall not alter the configuration settings from the approved FDCC configuration. The information technology should also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default ýprogram filesý directory and should be able to silently install and uninstall.

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners to support Consular posts overseas.  The choice to use the D230 as opposed to other barcode readers available is that this unit is a drop-in replacement to the barcode scanners previously used (Gryphon D200 and D220 barcode scanners that have recently reached end-of-life).   The continued use of Datalogic scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  In addition, the barcode scanners require customized software.  Because the D230 model is similar to the models previously used, no changes will be required for the customized software due to driver incompatibilities.  The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanner meets the following requirements: ý	The scanner works with both NIV (Non-Immigrant Visa) and IVO (Immigrant Visa Overseas) applications.  ý	The scanner reads both one-dimensional (linear) and two-dimensional (stacked) barcodes. ý	The scanner must use and draw its power from the USB 2.0 interface. This will remove the need to purchase 110-volt and 220-volt power supplies. ý	The scanner provides full compatibility with every application that exploits the USB interface: USB KBD (keyboard) Wedge, USB COM (communication) emulation and USB IBM POS (point of sale). In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners without delay.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. CA/CST has selected the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners because results obtain by the Bureauýs System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturersý scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoSýs processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairsý Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Fujitsu FI-5220C Document Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Fujitsu FI-5220C document scanner to support Consular posts overseas.  The Fujitsu FI-5220C are a high-speed color capable scanner with top speed of 40 sheets per minute or 80 (when scanning both sides of each sheet) page images per minute. The product complies and is able to operate within Consular Affairs (CA) Modernized Systems architecture.  This scanner meets specific requirements for CA Non-Immigrant Visa (NIV) applications.  It is also suitable for use with other CA applications.   In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Fujitsu FI-5220C document scanner without delay.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. The choice to use the Fujitsu FI-5220C document scanner as opposed to other document scanners available is that CA/CST/CS has acquired and fielded several hundred of these scanners since its inception in 2002.  The Fujitsu FI-5220C offers more features and is more robust than other scanners in this price range.  The continued use of Fujitsu scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  Furthermore, no additional training to those handling the scanner is necessary with the continued use of this scanner.   In addition, the document scanners require customized software.  Because the proprietary Consular applications (NIV, IVO, ACS+, and INK) have been developed to work with this specific document scanner, it is most cost effective to continue to use the Fujitsu FI-5220C scanner rather than introduce another manufacturerýs product.  Another manufacturerýs product will require redesigning the CA applications.   CA/CST has selected the Fujitsu FI-5220C document scanner because results obtain by the Bureauýs System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturersý scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoSý processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The Fujitsu FI-5220C document scanner has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairsý Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.

<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement for a course entitled ?Practical Hydraulic Workshop & Troubleshooting Workshop?.  The objective of the training is to teach Glenn Research Center employees about J2-X TVC applications. The course shall include basic fluid power principles & laws, how to read hydraulic schematics, learning the pumps, valves, actuators, contamination control, proactive maintenance and closed-loop hydrostatics. The vendor shall be responsible for providing all training materials to include all required simulator equipment, workbooks, reference materials and supplies.  The vendor shall conduct two, 5-day sessions for 12 students each.  Training shall be held at NASA?s Glenn Research Center on January 28 ? February 1, 2008 and February 11 ? 15, 2008.	 NASA/NSSC intends to purchase the training course from Fluid Power Training Institute Inc., 2170 S 3140 W Ste B, Salt Lake City, UT 84119-1263.  Pursuant to FAR 13.106, the acquisition of these services has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1) This is an existing course that needs no modification to the vendor?s current course offering and meets the needs of GRC; 2) The course is needed based on urgency for the end of January and early February;  3)  The vendor has extensive experience in delivering "hands-on" workshops for companies throughout the USA and Canada; 4) The vendor?s expertise and many years of hands-on experience provides for cost-effective, timely, specialized training that can not be readily duplicated by any other source within the timelines required. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 3, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Capabilities and qualifications should be submitted to Megan Willis at Megan.M.Willis@nasa.gov.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This is a market survey for Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI). The FAA envisions the use of CDTI will support the use of aviation data sources such as ADS-B for both air- and ground-based flight operations.  CDTI is envisioned to increase NAS capacity, efficiency and safety by providing pilots with traffic information tailored for specific traffic applications. The FAA is seeking to better understand industry, academia and government capabilities in the area of CDTI human factors to inform Research and Development investments in the areas of: - Understanding human factors and operational impacts of CDTI usage. - Integration of CDTI data elements into existing flight deck displays. - Use of CDTI to support trajectory-based operations. - Measurement of the impact of CDTI on pilot performance, aviation operations  and safety. - Identification of certification and training issues related to CDTI usage. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interests and capabilities.  All interested parties are requested to submit the following information: -  Demonstrated technical experience and knowledgeable personnel in the areas of human facotrs and cockit display design. -  Methods for measuring pilot human performance. -  Experience in designing prototype cockpit displays for experimental testing. -  Experience in conducting part-task and full-task human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations. -  Demonstrated knowledge and application of human system interaction (HSI) principles to data integration. -  Understanding of ADS-B application to CDTI air- and ground-based applications. -  Experience in collecting human factors data using non-experimental methods. The FAA encourages interested organizations to partner where needed to address the above topic areas.  All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with respolnse to this Market Survey Announcement.  Therefore, any cost associated with this market survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334515, 500 employee size standard. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a request for proposal (RFP).   Per FAR 19.502-2(b), this requirement will be a total set-aside for small businesses.  Only proposals from small businesses will be accepted.   The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to procure on a competitive basis the refurbishment of an Anechoic Chamber.  SEE STATEMENT OF WORK BELOW.   STATEMENT OF WORK: C-1__SCOPE This specification defines the requirements for services and materials to refurbish an existing shielded anechoic chamber located at the Naval Surface Weapons Center (NSWC), Dahlgren, Virginia.  This facility, known as the Q50 Anechoic Chamber, was completed in 1972 and is currently in operation as a test chamber for the electromagnetic vulnerability testing of various Navy missile and electronic systems. Due to deteriorating absorber material, the present level of RF anechoic performance is unknown.  After replacement of the current RF absorber materials, full characterization of the performance of the chamber is required over an operating frequency spectrum from 80 MHz to 60 GHz.  Currently, most testing in the chamber is conducted over the range of 200 MHz to 18 GHz, but the characterization should include data points throughout the operating range. This anechoic chamber is approximately 60 feet long, 28 feet wide and 28 feet high.  The source end has a mezzanine platform on which RF antennas are mounted.  On one longitudinal wall there are two doors. The equipment door is approximately 20 feet wide and 14 feet high (through which the missiles and other test objects are loaded), and there is a separate smaller door for personnel access.  Approximately 30 feet from the mezzanine there is a 17 foot diameter turntable upon which are mounted two pylons which support test articles. Contractor shall provide all labor and materials to complete the following tasks: 1) Contractor shall remove and dispose of all existing RF absorber material in the anechoic chamber. 2) Contractor shall clean all walls, ceiling, floors, and air vents of dirt, corrosion, and old adhesives. 3) After contractor has removed the old absorber and cleaned all surfaces, the contractor shall allow the Government  three (3) working days to inspect the chamber structure and make minor repairs on the chamber, such as tightening bolts, repairing shielding, removing corrosion, and inspection for structural damage.  If major damage is found, the contractor shall allow the Government reasonable time to make repairs. 4) Contractor shall replace all old RF absorber material with new RF absorber material in the size and placement which will result in a chamber with the performance characteristics noted in section C-3.  Material requirements are outlined in section C-4. 5) Contractor shall provide a test plan to characterize the performance of the refurbished chamber for government approval, perform complete characterization testing, and deliver a test report documenting the results as outlined in section C-5.  C-2__OBJECTIVE The objective of the refurbishment is to perform repair, replacement, and modification as necessary to ensure that the chamber can simulate a ?free space? test environment while suppressing the emission or entry of undesired electromagnetic energy.   A major consideration in this task is the minimization of site disturbance and total ?down time? of the facility caused by the refurbishment.  Extended work hours or weekend access to the chamber may be arranged by the NSWC Q50 COTR, if significant reductions in the overall project duration can be achieved. C-3__RF_PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS The RF Absorber design/layout will produce two overlapping quiet zones which are defined for this chamber.  One is a 6 foot diameter spherical quiet zone, which is centered on the longitudinal axis of the chamber and located at a point 16 feet from the back of the rear/target wall absorber; the other is a 20 foot long by 10 foot diameter cylindrical quiet zone also centered on the longitudinal axis, with the cylinder midpoint 16 feet from the back of the rear/target wall absorber.  Within these quiet zones the maximum level of reflected signals arriving from any direction shall be as specified in Tables I and II when measured by the free space VSWR technique.  Changes in reflectivity as a function of a rotating polarization of the synchronized source and receiving antenna shall be less than 1.0 dB in the cylindrical quiet zone.  Details of test requirements and documentation are contained in section C-5. The interior reflectivity of the chamber after the refurbishment shall be as stated below in Tables I and II of this specification. TABLE I (RELECTIVITY REQUIREMENTS ?6 FT SPERICAL QUITE ZONE): 0.2 GHz to 0.5 GHz (Frequency Range)/ ? 20db (Minimum Attenuation); 0.5 GHz to 1.0 GHz (Frequency Range)/ ? 30db (Minimum Attenuation); 1.0 GHz to 3.0 GHz (Frequency Range)/ -40db (Minimum Attenuation); 3.0 GHz to 10.0 GHz (Frequency Range)/-45db (Minimum Attenuation); 10.0 GHz to 40.0 GHz (Frequency Range)/ -50db (Minimum Attenuation); TABLE II (REFLECTIVITY REQUIREMENTS ? 20 FT LONG BY 10 FT DIAMETER CYLINDRICAL QUIET ZONE): 1.0 GHz to 3.0 GHz (Frequency Range)/ -20db (Minimum Attenuation); 3.0 GHz to 10.0 GHz (Frequency Range)/ -30db (Minimum Attenuation); 10.0 GHz to 40.0 GHz (Frequency Range)/ -45db (Minimum Attenuation) C-4__ABSORBER MATERIAL All absorber material used in the refurbishment shall meet the fire retardancy requirements of NRL Specification 8093 tests 1, 2, and 3 or commercial equivalent.  The material used shall have a good light-reflecting surface consistent with the suppliers manufacturing techniques. All absorber material shall be capable of continuously dissipating at least 1.25 watts per square inch (average power) of incident electromagnetic energy without damage. All absorber material installed above the floor shall be firmly attached to the surfaces by a semi-permanent method in accordance with best commercial practices which will permit removal without damage to the wall or ceiling surfaces of the chamber.  The absorber used on the turntable or floor of the test area shall not be attached to the surface, but shall be capable of being placed so as to completely cover the area.  Additional requirements for walk-on surfaces are noted below in section C-4.2. Each section of absorber material should tightly abut the neighboring sections, leaving no holes or open spaces except where required for light fixtures, switches, etc.  All corners, angles, and curves shall be miter cut to ensure proper fit.  Contractor shall cover the turntable with new absorber, with the pylons being at their widest extension.  Absorber on the perimeter of the turntable shall be tapered at 45 degree angles to allow for clearance while tilting the turntable.  Perimeter sections shall be slotted to form a snug union with the lip on the edge of the table. Contractor shall supply eight (8) additional sections of each type of absorber material used on the chamber floor, and twelve (12) additional sections of the absorber material used on the turntable for use as spares.  A section is defined as a 2 foot by 2 foot (base) square piece of new absorber. All electrical apparatus, distributing systems, wiring and access, and lighting systems in place shall not be disturbed or altered during the refurbishment without express prior approval of the NSWC Q50 COTR.  Requests for such alterations must be submitted prior to undertaking the work.  Any changes or alterations to the electrical or lighting systems will be the responsibility of NSWC. C-4.1__SPECIAL ABSORBER A 12 foot by 12 foot plenum region centered on the rear/target wall shall be covered with a porous absorber having the fire retardant and reflectivity performance of the other wall material as specified above or better.  The internal temperature of the absorber shall be maintained at a temperature not to exceed 20 degrees Fahrenheit above ambient, while dissipating at least 2.0 watts per square inch of RF average power with forced air passing through the absorber.  For the forced air cooling, the air shall pass from inside to outside the chamber through the back wall absorber to minimize the fire hazard.  Additional fire retardant porous absorber with a reflectivity performance of the front wall material shall cover a six foot high by six foot long region centered on the front wall behind the transmitting antenna.  As the air conditioning output vents located in the ceiling near the source end of the chamber are outfitted with porous absorber, best commercial practices shoul!  d be used to ensure that the adhesive does not impede the flow of air into the chamber. C-4.2__WALK-ON ABSORBER REQUIREMENTS 	Contractor shall provide a minimum 6 ft wide walkway consisting of black walk-on absorber sections that extends from the mezzanine doorway, down the side of the chamber to the far side of the large door and from the edge of the large door 20 feet into the chamber behind the turntable.  Additional walk-on absorber shall be placed on the turntable to allow access to the mounting pylons.  From the first point of contact with the turntable, the walk-on absorber shall be cut in a curve to match the perimeter of the turntable.  A protective surface mat shall be supplied by the contractor that covers the walkway.  This material shall not degrade the quiet zone areas as specified in section C-3. C-5__CHAMBER REFLECTIVITY MEASUREMENTS The contractor shall prepare and present a comprehensive chamber characterization test plan to NSWC for approval prior to undertaking verification tests. The contractor shall provide all labor, material, and special test equipment for chamber characterization measurements, conduct the tests, acquire the data, and analyze it for presentation to NSWC.  Measurement and test operations will be observed by NSWC personnel. A comprehensive written test report shall be prepared by the contractor and submitted within 30 days after completion of the chamber refurbishment work.  This report shall include free space reflectivity measurements, a record of all test methods and equipment used during testing, and all data recorded, including all RF test points, frequencies, and readings obtained. It is anticipated that the contractor?s choice of refurbishment materials, methods, and techniques will enable the chamber to meet the specifications outlined in section C-3.  In the event that there are instances of non-specification performance, the contractor will take such remedial action as are reasonable to provide ?fixes? and the measurements will be repeated to verify conformance.  All re-measurement procedures shall be witnessed by a NSWC Q50 representative.   If, prior to installing the new RF absorber material, the contractor has reason to believe that the specifications cannot be met, he will notify the NSWC Q50 COTR in writing, and recommend values which he believes to be reasonable for the conditions.  NSWC may, upon reviewing the request for an alteration of specified performance, grant such a waiver prior to or during the actual measurement program. The reflectivity performance of the anechoic chamber shall be measured by a procedure using the ?Free Space VSWR? technique based on best commercial practices.  At a minimum, measurements shall be made at each of the following frequencies:  0.2 GHz, 0.5 GHz, 1.0 GHz, 3.0 GHz, 10.0 GHz, and 18.0 GHz.  Testing at 0.2 GHz and 1.0 GHz will be performed for circular polarization as well as horizontal and vertical linear polarization.  The report should identify the lowest possible frequency below 0.2 GHz at which the reflectivity specifications can still be met. The Contractor shall provide all labor and materials to complete the tasks in the following CLINS: 0001: Contractor shall remove and dispose of all existing RF absorber material in the anechoic chamber, clean chamber surfaces, replace RF absorber material, and provide test plan in accordance with the Statement of Work.

All offers shall be evaluated for fair and reasonable price, technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance, delivery schedule and adherence to the applicable clauses/provisions.  Notice to Offerers:  This procurement is part of the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System RED/Yellow/Green Program.  Award will be based on the contracting officer's decision as to which offer provides the best value to the Navy, price, past performance, and other factors considered. NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).   (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.   ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).   (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f!  irst article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.   (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows: 	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. 	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery. (e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data. REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESS TO NNSY Contractors? representatives must be United States citizens. Representatives are to provide the NNSY Security Office proof of U.S. citizenship (i.e. DHS I-9 FORM. ?Employee Eligibility Verification Form?). The I-9 is based on presentation of appropriate documentation that both verifies the employee?s eligibility for employment and denotes his citizenship status. Contractors can go to http://www.nnsy1.navy.mil/Secutity/docs/i-9.pdf to acquire the required form and completion guidance. NOTE: (1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard. (2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee?s clearance status may suffice depending on the employee?s status within the JPAS database. (3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued. VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER. Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that person?s citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery). Material Shipments: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to the Material Division (phone: 757-396-3141 and fax: 757-396-1029).

IF THE PERSON FOR WHOM THE VENVOR/CONTRACTOR IS REQUESTING A BADGE WAS BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, THAT PERSON SHALL BRING POSITIVE DOCUMENTATION OF UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP TO THE NORFOLK NAVAL SHIPYARD PASS OFFICE IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY LETTER. The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. If the person for whom the vendor/contractor is requesting a badge is a naturalized United States citizen, that person SHALL BRING THEIR ORIGINAL NATURALIZATION papers with them to the pass office in addition to the aforementioned company letter. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. 		******* End of Combined Synopsis/Solicitation ********

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure a Multi-Function Display (MFD) System in support of PMS 500?s DDG 1000 Program.  The tasks cover design, fabrication, testing and delivery of the production representative model, as well as support for integration, installation and checkout.  Upon successful completion of developmental test, integration test and first article test the Government may exercise contract options for production and fielding of seven systems and spares.  A competitive 100% Small Business Set Aside is anticipated.

The MFD program objective is the acquisition and initial support of an integrated display that will provide three different visual cues for day and night helicopter operations on DDG 1000 class ships.  The visual cues integrated into the MFD include the flight deck status display, a horizon reference display and an Aircraft-Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) System position display.  The MFD will communicate with the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI) Network through redundant Distributed Adaptation Processors (DAPs) to receive ship?s roll stabilization signals from NAVDDX and to update settings such as deck status and lighting intensity to accommodate a variety of meteorological and lighting conditions for flight operations.  The system will be controlled by command signals from a remote operator.  The operator interface will be a Common Electronic Display (CED) provided by the ship builder and located in the Helicopter Control Station (HCS).  Commands will be received by the MFD via the TSCEI and DAPs.  Emergency operation and maintenance capability will be provided via a hard-wired maintenance control panel provided as part of the system.  The MFD program will involve designing, building and testing a production representative system in order to achieve the objectives set forth in the DDG 1000 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and to demonstrate conformance to the MFD System Specification with the option to purchase production systems.  The MFD contract is a portion of the next generation suite of Visual Landing Aids which will be incorporated into the DDG 1000.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to the companies that respond to the FedBizOpps synopsis, as well as those companies on the solicitation mailing list.  Because the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the solicitation package is mailed.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) number and a company?s CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense.
Award will be based on a determination of ?Best Value?, which may require discussions with the offerors. The evaluation factors will be Technical, Experience, Past Performance, and Price.  Copies of DD Form 2345 and request for copies of the solicitation shall be forwarded to Mr. David Andreoli, 732-323-5208, david.andreoli@navy.mil, fax # 732-323-7440.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13 (Dollar Threshold of $100,000) a firm-fixed price purchase order to Molly Crawshaw, 13 Talana Cirlce, Hot Springs Village, AR  71909-7412 for ?Consulting Services to assist CMS with ?Review of Accrediting Organization Deeming Applications.?  Under the authority of FAR 6.301-1 10 U.S.C. 2304 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.  The Center for Medicaid and State Operations is responsible for reviewing deeming authority applications from accrediting organizations, and determining whether CMS will approve or deny such applications.   Section 1865(b)(1) of the Social Security Act provides that, if a provider entity demonstrates through accreditation by an approved national accrediting organization that all applicable Medicare conditions are met or exceeded, CMS will deem those provider entities as having met the requirements.  If an accrediting organization is recognized by the Secretary as having standards for accreditation that meet or exceed Medicare requirements, a provider entity accredited by the national accrediting body?s approved program may be deemed to meet the Medicare conditions.  A national accreditation organization applying for approval of deeming authority under part 488, subpart A must provide us with reasonable assurance that the accreditation organization requires the accredited provider entities to meet requirements that are at least as stringent as the Medicare conditions.  The regulations concerning approval and re-approval of accrediting organizations are set forth at section ?488.4 and ?488.8(d)(3).  The regulations at section 488.8(d)(3) require accreditation organizations to reapply for continued approval of deeming authority every six years or sooner as we determine.  The purpose of this acquisition is to secure the advice and services of a recognized and respected expert in the field of hospitals, critical access hospitals (CAHs) and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). This individual will provide technical consultation, conduct comprehensive reviews of accrediting organization deeming applications, participate in corporate site visits and survey observations, provide written summaries of review findings, and participate in teleconferences with the project officer and other deeming application review team meetings.  Specifically, this individual will be expected to:
?	Review, analyze and provide written comments on documents related to accrediting organization applications and re-applications for deeming authority.
?	Participate in teleconferences with the project officer and other review team meetings.

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 08 should be submitted by 28 February 2008 and FY 09 by 15 August 2008.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 September 2010, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Our military forces produce highly accurate predictions of the future state of the Natural Battlespace Environment (NBE; e.g., terrestrial and space weather). The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, seeks innovative research efforts that advance our ability to exploit this understanding within our computer-augmented decision-making processes [i.e., in Command & Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, (C2ISR), applications].

We require capabilities that afford C2ISR applications the ability to "visualize-to-utilize" NBE influences directly within their applications to manage operational risk; incorporation is the key.  This will enable decision-makers at all command levels to quickly and seamlessly acquire situational awareness of the NBE and its affects on current and proposed military operations.  It will also allow commanders to proactively mitigate adverse NBE impacts to blue force operations, effortlessly exploit asymmetric NBE advantages (i.e., take advantage of the difference between our forces' ability to operate in weather versus our adversaries' abilities), and cope with uncertainty? to provide full spectrum decision superiority. 

The ultimate goal is to invent, integrate, demonstrate, and transition component technologies [e.g., innovative algorithms, services, revolutionary visualizations, and creative processes (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures)] into existing and emerging C2ISR applications. It is expected that components will be devised, built, tested, and included in modular software developer toolkits and/or services that C2ISR developers can use to seamlessly incorporate NBE Operational Risk Management (ORM) within their decision-support tools/ applications/ systems. Figures of merit in assessing module effectiveness include verification and validation of algorithms, ease of code integration, ease in understanding the advice that is presented (including any representations of uncertainty), providing answers/advice within allotted decision cycles (i.e., performance), and increased mission success rates.

Requirements:

- Developments shall be scalable, component-based, integration-ready, seamless, service-oriented, event-driven, and government-owned solutions that achieve real capability.

- Software modules/components must be in C++/.NET, Java/J2SE, or both.

- The developed capabilities will be targeted for transition into the AF Weather Weapon System and dozens of Command & Control programs that have pending weather advice incorporation requirements. Therefore, the resulting "capability-lets" will be bundled and licensed to C2 developers.

- Efforts shall be compatible and consistent with the Joint Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Conceptual Data Model, an official subset of the DoD Enterprise Data Model, and the XML Joint METOC Broker Language.

Reference information:

Air Force Doctrine 2-9.1, Weather Operations, 3 May 2006 (http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/service_pubs/afdd2_9_1.pdf)

Joint Publication 3-59, Joint Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for Meteorological and Oceanographic Operations, 23 March 1999 (http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_59.pdf)

Joint METOC Public Data Administration Website (http://www.cffc.navy.mil/metoc/)

Please consider the following, but they should not be used to limit or constrain creative ideas.

1. Representing the state of the atmosphere has been quite challenging. To adequately describe past, present, and future states, weather data is arranged in five dimensions [latitude, longitude, altitude, time, and measures (e.g., pressure, temperature, and wind vectors)]; many measures per point, many points within a uniformly gridded 3-D cube, many cubes over discrete time intervals. The Joint METOC Conceptual Data Model, an official subset of the DoD Enterprise Data Model, and the XML Joint METOC Broker Language were developed to format, store, and disseminate multidimensional weather data.

2. Relating the state of the atmosphere, operational thresholds, and operational intentions is profoundly complex with many degrees of freedom.

3. Decision-support tools must deal with the weather community's compound time dimension. First is normal clock time. Then there is PAST time: climatology (average is 95 with a standard deviation of 3) vs. historical archive (it was 95 at 1300 two years ago today); PRESENT time: the observation (it is 95, but consider, however, that by the time this fact reaches a decision-support tool it WAS 95 and therefore really relegated to the historical); and FUTURE time: near-term forecast (will be 95 in two hours) vs. long-term forecast (will be 95 thirty six hours from now) vs. extended forecast (will be 95 four days hence). Climatology (mentioned above) is used to predict what it will be like a long time from now (will average above 95 two months hence), completing the complicated loop. And then there is forecast model run time (yesterday's forecast of tomorrow's high was 95; today's forecast of tomorrow's high is 90; and then there will be tomorrow's near-term, expectedly more accurate, forecast high which might turn out to be 91).

4. How do we effectively manage a repository of NBE-advice-incorporation capabilities [i.e., Software Developers' Toolkit and NBE ORM Services] that C2 application developers can use to meet their weather requirements?  How does a 1st party use a 2nd party toolkit that is populated by 3rd party creations?

5. Context-Sensitive Decision-Support. Because there is so much information available to decision-makers, it is paramount to good command and control that visualizations fuse data and present only the information that is important to what is going on. As a trivial example, cluttering the screen with high altitude clouds when a decision-maker is working on take off times is not helpful. Showing target visibility when working air refueling timing is detrimental. Therefore, ORM visualizations need to be sensitive to current context while at the same time ensuring that important related information is not precluded.

6. It is not necessarily obvious what NBE advice fits where. All military decision-makers agree that the NBE affects military operations, but most struggle to articulate what advice would add value to any particular decision point. Most warfighters also do not understand what military weather agencies are capable of and consequently are not sure what to ask for. The accuracy of forecast products and perceptions of accuracy also have bearing on what could add value in a given situation versus what may be detrimental. Vague requirements for weather advice have been documented, but implementable specifications are hard to come by.

7. Deriving accurate risk analyses (i.e., context-sensitive impact determination) must be fast. Waiting even a few seconds for a weather impact update every time a decision-maker changes something has been declared unacceptable. Warfighters desire instant update rates, but in reality the time that they are willing to wait is a function of the value they put in the advice (i.e., if they think it is important, they will wait a few minutes despite their stated desire). On the other hand, however, they won't be able to wait minutes hundreds of times an hour.

8. How do we utilize probabilistic forecasting capabilities made possible by emerging ensemble forecasting methods?

9. The move to ensemble forecasting will also make it possible to quantify uncertainty in forecasts. It is a major requirement for C2ISR applications to incorporate uncertainty within their decision-making processes. How do we leverage NBE advice uncertainty in our reasoning? 

10. There are no NBE decision-support tools. There are only decision-support tools that incorporate NBE risk advice. Stand alone weather decision aid "calculators" are useful in showing what is possible and for hammering out how to display advice, but such Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs) do not meet the requirement of incorporation within warfighter decision-support systems.

11. Note that ORM applies to management of all things risk, not just safety.

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $5.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 08 - $2.5M and FY 09 - $3.0M.

4.  FUNDING RESTRICTIONS:  The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.   Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the innovation of the proposed technology, the technical approach, and the operational relevance of the problem solution to address current and future Air Force net-centric requirements, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates intellect, technical expertise, and domain knowledge, (3) Openness of Solution - The extent to which open architecture standards and technologies are leveraged, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

Resulting software capabilities will be packaged in a Software Developers' Toolkit that will be licensed free of charge to qualified DoD contractors working on command and control R&D projects. Resulting software services (i.e., loosely coupled software agents interacting to achieve desired end results for a service consumers) shall be made available or provided free of charge to qualified DoD contractors working on command and control R&D projects.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) intends to issue a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) modification to MR Popovich and Company, San Diego, CA, under BPA N61339-03-A-0005, on a sole source basis due to only one known responsible source who can meet the short term requirement until the full scope of the requirement can be solicited competitively.  The RFP for the full requirement is expected to be issued on or about 07 January 2008.  This modification will extend the period of performance for the existing services from 30 January 2008 until 30 April 2008 with an additional two (2) month option.  Although more than one source may be able to fulfill the requirement, this would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the Government?s requirement.  This BPA modification will provide for instructional support of the Battle Force Training (BFT) Courses consisting of, Over the Horizon Targeting (OTHT-T), Command /Control /Communications/ Computers/ and Intelligence (C4I) System Engineering (C4I SYS ENG) and Common Operational Picture Advanced (COP ADV), and Tactical Tomahawk Weapons System Engineering (TTWS-E).  These courses are taught on an instructor-only basis, with the contractor providing all instructional services, student guides and related travel in support of these courses at government facilities.

The OTHT-T course provides tactical watch personnel onboard Global Command and Control System-Maritime (GCCS-M) and Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS) ships with an in-depth overview of the Over-the-Horizon Targeting (OTH-T) Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) architecture. This includes how sensors, nodes and communications are used to build a tactical picture and how mission data is delivered to Tomahawk platforms.  This course is part of a pipeline for Over the Horizon Targeting Supervisor (NEC 1332).  The C4I SYS ENG course provides system operator/administrator/maintainer personnel onboard Global Command and Control System-Maritime (GCCS-M) and Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS) ships with a basic understanding of applicable system hardware and connectivity, applicable system software, primary system support organizations, system documentation and data communications leading to the ability to conduct system level troubleshooting. This course is part of a pipeline for Over the Horizon Targeting Supervisor (NEC 1332).  The COP Advanced course provides E6 to O4 personnel the knowledge required to perform the duties of Common Tactical Picture Manager or as assistant Common Tactical Picture Manager in any Area of Operations (AOR).  The TTWS-E course provides system level training in Tactical Tomahawk computers and communications paths.  It teaches ship/sub/shore personnel to successfully send and receive Tomahawk Command and Control (TC2) data via applicable communication paths (both legacy and IT21) and how to configure the Global Command and Control System-Maritime (GCCS-M) and Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS) to exchange track data using the COP Synch Tools (CST) application.  This course is part of a pipeline for Over the Horizon Targeting Supervisor (NEC 1332).

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  The response should include, but not be limited to the following:  a) a one page company history description to include: business size classification, major services provided (include the number of years), primary customer base, and points of contacts (with telephone numbers) that are able to discuss the material submitted.  b) A description of the companys past experience at providing the services as outlined in the above course description.  c) Any other technical information the company deems necessary to aid the Government in making an informed assessment.  Only written responses transmitted electronically, or by mail will be accepted.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Contract Specialist, Karen Henderson, (407) 381-8781, email karen.henderson@navy.mil.

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, the Operations and Maintenance Contractor for the NCI Frederick Cancer Research Facility is soliciting for the services described herein on behalf of the NCI. The NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer (CPTC) initiative was established with the goal of creating technologies, data, reagents and reference materials, analysis systems and infrastructure as a basis for advancing discovery research and clinical applications.  More information about the initiative can be found at http://proteomics.cancer.gov.  As part of the CPTC, a series of renewable and highly characterized affinity binding reagents will be generated and made available to the research community.  Detailed standard operating procedures (SOP?s) will be made available along with characterization data through a web portal.  This will ensure that experiments can be both repeated and compared among researchers.
 

The specific objective of this scope of work is to generate antibodies from antigens already generated under the CPTC. There are forty-two antigens that will be used in the generation and screening for new monoclonal antibodies. 
 

Once a set of antibodies are generated and screened by the contractor for each antigen, the antibodies will be sent to SAIC-F and undergo further screening and characterization including but not limited to Western Blot, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), immuno capture and mass spectrometry, and immuno histochemistry (IHC).  The data from all phases of the characterization, i.e. from contractor and other entities selected by NCI will be made public through the associated web portal.  The final antibodies and associated hybridoma cells will be made available to the scientific community through a distributor or repository selected by the NCI.  


The RFP is intended to solicit responses from parties interested in providing the antibodies to the NCI CPTC.  Multiple contracts may be issued. Full RFP to be posted by end of day 11/19/07.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a market survey for Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI). The FAA envisions the use of CDTI will support the use of aviation data sources such as ADS-B for both air- and ground-based flight operations.  CDTI is envisioned to increase NAS capacity, efficiency and safety by providing pilots with traffic information tailored for specific traffic applications. The FAA is seeking to better understand industry, academia and government capabilities in the area of CDTI human factors to inform Research and Development investments in the areas of: - Understanding human factors and operational impacts of CDTI usage. - Integration of CDTI data elements into existing flight deck displays. - Use of CDTI to support trajectory-based operations. - Measurement of the impact of CDTI on pilot performance, aviation operations  and safety. - Identification of certification and training issues related to CDTI usage. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interests and capabilities.  All interested parties are requested to submit the following information: -  Demonstrated technical experience and knowledgeable personnel in the areas of human facotrs and cockit display design. -  Methods for measuring pilot human performance. -  Experience in designing prototype cockpit displays for experimental testing. -  Experience in conducting part-task and full-task human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations. -  Demonstrated knowledge and application of human system interaction (HSI) principles to data integration. -  Understanding of ADS-B application to CDTI air- and ground-based applications. -  Experience in collecting human factors data using non-experimental methods. The FAA encourages interested organizations to partner where needed to address the above topic areas.  All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with respolnse to this Market Survey Announcement.  Therefore, any cost associated with this market survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense.  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)code for this effort is 541330, with a size standard of $6.5 million. Responses containing marketing materials are not desired and may be discarded without review. One, some, all or none of the respondents to the Market Survey may be requested to provide additional information at the option of the Government. No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise for future FAA business. Information obtained will be used to support the development of an acquisition strategy for CDTI human factors research and development. Interested parties should reply via email by close of business January 8, 2008 to Tanyka.L.Lawrence@faa.gov

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps) for a parcel of land.  FEMA is seeking expressions of interest from owners of vacant parcels of land located in one of the following parishes in Louisiana:  East Feliciana, West Feliciana, St. Helena, Tangipahoa, Livingston, East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Pointe Coupee, Ascension.  General Services Administration (GSA) will enter into a lease contract on behalf of FEMA with the owner whose parcel of land is technically acceptable for the intended use of the Government. <br><br>

The intended use of the leased land is to provide storage for travel trailers and/or mobile homes which were used by the Louisiana Housing Task Force as temporary emergency housing units (EHU) to those individuals displaced from their permanent residences by Hurricane Katrina.  These EHU will not be occupied. <br><br>

FEMA intends to lease only the land that is determined to meet all the governmental technical requirements.  The determination of technical acceptability is made by the GSA Contracting Officer.  In making a determination, the GSA Contracting Officer will use technical criteria provided by FEMA program officials, other federal agencies guidelines and technical contractors who are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the site.  The determination process is two-phased.  The first phase will use the criteria listed in this ad to determine if expressions of interest meet the minimum criteria for the intended use by the Government.  Those individuals responding with an expression of interest that meet these minimum criteria will be provided with a Solicitation for Offer (SFO).  The second phase of determination is based upon the additional technical requirements specified within the SFO.  Only the offers that meet all the technical requirements of both this ad and the SFO will be considered for award.<br><br>

Land owners who meet the following minimum criteria are requested to provide expressions of interest to GSA:<br>

1.	Land which is located in one of the following parishes in Louisiana:  East Feliciana, West Feliciana, St. Helena, Tangipahoa, Livingston, East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Pointe Coupee, Ascension.<br><br>
2.	Parcels of Land no smaller than 300 and no larger than 540 acres.<br><br>
3.	Land that is flat and hard-surfaced (no loose soil and no crop lands), cleared of trees, debris and other impediments to support travel trailers and mobile homes.<br><br>
4. 	Land owner will allow placement of gravel/rock on roadways and lanes on the property with possible culvert/piping to make property more accessible and conducive to staging travel trailers and mobile homes.<br><br>
5.	Land that has direct access from primary/secondary paved roads.  Preference is for land with a minimum of 200 feet frontage on these roads.<br><br>
6.	Land that has water, sewerage and electric service is required.<br><br>
7.	Land that is not wetlands.<br><br>
8.	Land that meets local government ordinances, zoning requirements, and any other necessary approvals for government intended use (parish approval required).<br><br>
9.	Land that complies with all necessary environmental, archeological and historical regulations.<br><br>
10.	Occupancy is required by February 1, 2008. <br><br>

The expression of interest should include, as a minimum, the following information: <br>

1.	Owner name, address, phone number, fax number, and email address if available.<br><br>
2.	Written proof of ownership and/or of the legal control necessary to lease the land (e.g. copy of deed, mortgage document, or master lease stating the ability to sublease for the governments intended use).<br><br>
3.	A legal description of the property.<br><br>
4.	Description of the land:  size (number of acres), physical characteristics, past and current use.<br><br>
5.	Location of the land:  including the municipal (physical) address, city, parish, and a small map showing the location and access to the property.<br><br>
6.	Picture of the site.<br><br>
7.	If representing an owner, a written agreement with the owner showing authority to represent the owner.<br><br>
8.	Parish and City approval documents.<br><br>

All expressions of interest shall be addressed as follows and mailed to:<br><br>
General Services Administration 
Expression of Interest to Vacant Land
3535 S. Sherwood Forest Blvd., Suite 150
Baton Rouge, LA 70816<br><br>

SOLICITATION PROCESS:<br><br>
Typically, GSA will solicit offers from all technically acceptable sites.  Site acceptability will be established by the process of determination described above and within the Solicitation for Offer.  The leasing action will be awarded to the lowest price technically acceptable offer.<br><br>

DELINEATED AREA:<br><br>
Property offered to the Government in conjunction with this requirement must be located in one of the following parishes in Louisiana:  East Feliciana, West Feliciana, St. Helena, Tangipahoa, Livingston, East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Pointe Coupee, Ascension.<br><br>

LEASE TERM:<br><br>
2 years, 1- year firm term. <br><br>

RENTAL RATE:<br><br>
An annual rate of return on the estimated value of the selected site is offered as a lease rental payment.  The Government will not accept an increased value assessment or an excessive interest rate due to the nature of this requirement.  The intent of the Government is not to operate a commercial business on the property and, therefore, there is no income for consideration in determining a fair rental rate.<br><br>

RIGHT-OF-ENTRY FORM:<br><br>
The owner will be required to provide access and entry onto the property to FEMA and its representatives for the purpose of performance of environmental and other assessment to determine technical feasibility for intended use.<br>

<SUBJECT>R -- MiDAESS Acquisition
<SOLNBR>HQ0006-07-R-0012

<DESC>MiDAESS Update (4 December 2007)

We still intend to award the multiple MiDAESS contracts in phases. The awards will be by functional areas to align with our matrix organization. 
Examples of functional areas include the following: 
	Engineering 
	Quality, Safety and Mission Assurance 
	Acquisition management 
	Financial management 
	Administrative 
	Etc 

The winners in each of the functional areas will be supporting the MDA Headquarters in the National Capital Region as well as program office locations in Dahlgren VA, Huntsville AL, Los Angeles CA, Albuquerque NM, Colorado Springs CO and potentially others including overseas. We do not plan to award any location specific contracts unless we only need the support in one area. 

Each Functional Manager will decide how much of what kind of support needs to be where. We expect to realize efficiencies from MiDAESS that will allow us to reduce our overall A&AS headcount. We also expect to move specific support among offices within MDA as the work ebbs and flows. 

Work in each functional area will build up over time as existing contracts expire or reach option dates. We do not plan to terminate any existing contracts. 
We have yet to decide which functional areas will be in Phase I. However, we do intend to award the Phase I contracts before the beginning of FY 2009. Awarding the remaining contracts may require as much as two additional years. 

Where there will be a break in coverage, we will be either extending the current contracts or making sole source awards for a bridging period. 

We are planning to release a draft RFP in late January 2008. That draft will contain the objectives and work statements for all the functional areas as well as the NAICs codes and source selection criteria. 

Our intention is to prohibit exclusive teaming arrangements. 

The MiDAESS program office will be in the National Capital Region for the foreseeable future. That program office will administer all of the MiDAESS contracts, but the Contracting Officer Representative will work for the functional manager.  Our draft RFP anticipates four source selection areas: managerial, technical, past performance and cost/price. 

Our current plan is to have a substantial, formal performance monitoring effort on each of the MiDAESS contracts. Where we will be making multiple awards from the same Statement of Work, we will use past performance (with a consideration of cost/price) as the basis for awarding additional tasks within the work scope. 

I am not talking with any offerors now. Because of the number of offerors and my desire to keep everything balanced for everyone, our primary communications will be via the Fed Biz Ops and the PSC website. Everything will be on-the-table when we issue the draft RFP. We will consider every input. 

The PM intends to update PSC approximately bi-weekly. The next update will be after our in-process review with senior management (December 20). The one after will come in mid January.
 
This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.     Interested offerors may registerat http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive email notification when information, solicitation and any amendments and future documents regarding this acquisition are issued and available for downloading.     MDA will not directly send offerors the solicitation or any amendments.     It is the interested offerors responsibility to periodically check this website for updates.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARSYSCOM), on behalf of the Program Executive Office (PEO) for Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I), Submarine Communications Program Office, PMW-770, intends to issue a sole source RFP, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1, to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC) for the production and delivery of up to one-hundred and seven (107) Submarine High Data Rate(SubHDR) Global Broadcast Services (GBS)/Super High Frequency (SHF) modification kits,  four (4) SubHDR antenna systems, various SubHDR spare parts, and engineering support services, and the development, production, and delivery of one-hundred and seven (107) Underwater Explosion (UNDEX) modification kits.  The contract will include one base year and six one year options; award is anticipated in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008.  The modification kits, antennas, and spares will be procured on a firm fixed price basis and the engineering support services will be procured on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  The estimated value of the contract if all options are exercised is $77,500,000. The SubHDR antenna system enables commanders to communicate with all capital ships in the Battle Force via a common, flexible communications structure including electronic messaging, full motion video and imagery, and enhanced digital voice. The GBS /SHF  modification kits are required to meet full operational specifications for both SHF Tx/Rx (transmit and receive) functionality and to increase the GBS bandwidth to achieve the 1GHz frequency required to operate with the future Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) system. Development of the UNDEX modification kits will add robustness to various and existing system components to meet the SubHDR antenna system requirement for passing Grade A shock testing.

TITLE:  Forensic Analysis Software Tools for Exploitation & Reasoning (FASTER)   

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 07-04-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:     It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 07 should be submitted by 14 Dec 2006; FY 08 by 1 May 2007; and FY 09 by 1 May 2008.     White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 31 Oct 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.         

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that provide innovative technologies supporting the forensic analysis of Multiple Source Intelligence (Multi-INT) and persistent surveillance data, with a focus on information fusion and understanding.   

Objectives: 
The military requires an electronic evidence/intelligence investigative capability supporting the task of forensically examining Multi-INT data.   The objective of this effort is to develop automated or semi-automated tools for an analyst to perform this task.   The tools are focused toward discovering adversarial behavior within persistent surveillance data.  The intent is to find and perhaps predict enemy behavior by understanding their adaptable Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) and responding prior to implementation.   

The developed capabilities may be transitioned to various programs, for example, the AF Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS-AF), the Aerospace Operations Center (AOC) Weapon System, National Intelligence Exploitation Capabilities (IEC) environment, as well as the Army and Navy DCGS systems (DCGS-A and DCGS-N).

Scope:
Under this BAA, the intelligence provided by Moving Target Indicator (MTI) is the primary, but not the sole focus.  The scope includes forensic analysis, behavior and movement pattern analysis, and the development of predictive capabilities.  This involves advancing the state-of-the-art in the area of information discovery, development, fusion, cueing, and delivery of Multi-INT derived intelligence.

Current forensic analysis is a manual and time consuming process measured in days not hours. Beginning with a request for information (RFI), the analyst needs to assemble a composite vision of the situation associated with an event(s) and location. The tools and techniques used by analysts are constrained to a few intelligence sources which limit the forensics capacity.   What is required is a set of Multi-INT forensic capabilities to automate this process across a variety of intelligence data sources.  Traditional sources include HUMINT - Human Intelligence, GEOINT - Geospatial Intelligence, IMINT - Imagery Intelligence, MASINT - Measurement and Signature Intelligence, OSINT - Open Source Intelligence, and SIGINT - Signals Intelligence (COMINT - Communications Intelligence, ELINT - Electronic Intelligence, and Special Signals).  

These tools need to provide core detailed understanding of surface vehicle movement allowing not only efficient product/evidence development, but also electronic sharing of products to anticipate future events in a Multi-INT environment.  The concept has been demonstrated during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), in that the technical feasibility and military utility of forensic and reasoning capabilities to detect, backtrack, and provide multi-INT cueing, supports the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) providing not only situational awareness, but also strategic awareness.  

Funding Area Opportunities:
This 3-year initiative will employ spiral development to include testing occurring in the AFRL Fusion Facility with prototype delivery at 9-month intervals.  Offerors should focus on technologies that have a significant impact on forensic analysis and that provide near-term release of forensic software tools.  Advances are desired in motion pattern analysis; behavioral pattern analysis, cueing, MTI changes detection/"normalcy" modeling, cross-cueing, resource allocation, advanced reasoning and prediction techniques.  These tools will be leveraged to determine the intent of entities or groups of entities based on terrain, doctrine, and historical data. The combination of these technologies will provide a powerful tool set for operators to exploit Multi-INT data and will enable the creation of a more comprehensive forensic picture. The development of inferential reasoning and predictive techniques based on prior templating that will support cueing anticipated Improvised Explosive Device (IED)-related events is also desired.  Examples include movement from caches, IED placement, convoy timing runs, triggering IEDs and escape to safe houses is also desired.

Technology areas include: MTI/Multi-INT tracking, Multi-INT database mining, rapid archival and retrieval capability, cueing/cross-cueing, Moving Target Intelligence (MOVINT) products & formats, and activity detection/identification.  Aspects of the research may include Kalman smoothing, finite sliding window averaging, Hough Transforms, Bayesian Nets, and fuzzy logic & predictive analysis (behavioral & motion patterns).  Predictive analysis, for example, involves finding terrorists prior to IED deployment and explosion by understanding their adaptable TTPs, and responding prior to implementation.   In addition, MOVINT technologies are of interest supporting the development of road usage statistics, route planning and interdiction, route deviation detection, mobility metrics, facility characterization (hours of operation, population, related locations/entities), and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) planning are of interest.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.0M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 07 - $750K; FY 08 - $1.5M; and FY09 - $1.75M.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Background: Joint Publication 2-01.3 "Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for the Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (JIPB)" describes the JIPB process, which focuses on defining the battlespace environment, describing the battlespace's effects, evaluation of the threat, and determination of adversary courses of action (COA).

Research programs, such as the Automated Assistance with Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (A2IPB), have begun to provide software tools for organizing the vast quantity of information necessary to support the JIPB process.  However, development of key IPB products is still a manual process, and there is a critical lack of software tools to support automated (or even semi-automated) development of the IPB key products.  

There are a variety of technical disciplines that are applicable to information fusion research.  Examples include: statistical based approaches, Bayesian belief networks; artificial neural systems; graph theory; knowledge based system technologies; fuzzy theory; hidden markov models; and Dempster-Shafer theory

Objective:  The objective of this BAA is to solve information fusion technology problems rapidly, by developing software tools that provide computational techniques to support the analysis of identities, behaviors, intentions, capabilitiy, capacity, kinematics, activity level, and saliences.  Examples of key IPB products include: Named Areas of Interest (NAI), Target Areas of Interest (TAI), Courses of Action (COA), Units, Infrastructure Areas (IA), Lines of Communication (LOC), Individuals, NAI Matrices, Target Value Matrices, LOC Matrices, and COA Matrices.

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $2.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 07 - $250K; FY 08 - $1M; FY 09 - $1M; FY 10 - $650K.

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, the Operations and Maintenance Contractor for the NCI Frederick Cancer Research Facility is soliciting for the services described herein on behalf of the NCI. The NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer (CPTC) initiative was established with the goal of creating technologies, data, reagents and reference materials, analysis systems and infrastructure as a basis for advancing discovery research and clinical applications.  More information about the initiative can be found at http://proteomics.cancer.gov.  As part of the CPTC, a series of renewable and highly characterized affinity binding reagents will be generated and made available to the research community.  Detailed standard operating procedures (SOP?s) will be made available along with characterization data through a web portal.  This will ensure that experiments can be both repeated and compared among researchers.
 

The specific objective of this scope of work is to generate antibodies from antigens already generated under the CPTC. There are forty-two antigens that will be used in the generation and screening for new monoclonal antibodies. 
 

Once a set of antibodies are generated and screened by the contractor for each antigen, the antibodies will be sent to SAIC-F and undergo further screening and characterization including but not limited to Western Blot, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), immuno capture and mass spectrometry, and immuno histochemistry (IHC).  The data from all phases of the characterization, i.e. from contractor and other entities selected by NCI will be made public through the associated web portal.  The final antibodies and associated hybridoma cells will be made available to the scientific community through a distributor or repository selected by the NCI.  


The RFP is intended to solicit responses from parties interested in providing the antibodies to the NCI CPTC.  Multiple contracts may be issued. Full RFP to be posted by end of day 11/19/07.

Are there any impending events or oversight requirements that compel the government to seek such a detailed response to a complex requirement, with a relatively short response time?< BR>R2: The governments long term planning cycle and acquisition framework support the required schedule.<BR>Q3: VistA and AHLTA are very complex systems that have evolved over a long period of time.

Will the government make the current agency detailed plans for these transformations available so that detailed and relevant recommendations may be developed?<BR>R3: The government will not provide information on VISTA  or AHLTA at this time that is not already in the public domain.<BR>Q4: Can the Government provide additional information with regard to the decision to focus exclusively on inpatient HER.<BR>R4: This question is unclear as to what specific information is being requested.<BR>Q5: Will the information gathered via this RFI process be integrated with recommendations from studies such as the Presidents Commission on Care for Americas Returning Wounded Warriors studies.  That information is acquisition sensiti ve.<BR>Q6: We would like the opportunity to meet with you so that we can develop a comprehensive response to the topics in this RFI.  If the submission deadline is then extended to January 31, 2008 we would be in a position to submit a strong response to t he RFL.<BR>R6: It is not appropriate at this time for the Government to meet with any vendors submitting information to this RFL.  Also, the Government is not in a position to be able to extend the deadline any further beyond the published submittal date p er Amendment 1 of the RFI issued 6 December 2007.  The submittal deadline remains at Noon (EST) on Thursday, 20 December 2007.<BR>Q7: Is the purpose of this RFI seeking responses from providers of enterprise wide solutions only?<BR>R7: Yes, the purpose of  this RFI seeks responses from providers of enterprise-wide solutions.<BR>A8: May we assume electronic submission by email attachment of our response is acceptable.<BR>R8: Yes, electronic submission by email is acceptable.<BR>Q9: Is the 2-page Executive Su mmary response in addition to the 30-pages for the primary response for a total of 32 pages.<BR>R9: Yes, it is in addition to the 30 pages for the primary response,  thus a total of 32 pages.<BR>Q10: I did not see any formatting rules for margins, font typ e and size, etc.  I did see 30 single-sided pages maximum rule, but are there particular font sizes and types, etc. that youd like us to use?<BR>R10: There are no specific formatting rules for margins, font type and size.  Typically responders use 1 marg ins and Times New Roman  10 pt. But you may use whatever you deem appropriate.<BR>Q11: We need clarification regarding the deadline for submittal  noon on December 20  is that Eastern Standard Time (EST)? Hawaii is five hours behind EST  so can we assu me that it implies noon Hawaii time, or 7 a.m. Hawaii time?<BR>R11:  The deadline for submittal is Noon Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Thursday, 20 December 2007.  Thus, yes, since Hawaii is five hours behind EST that would mean you would need to submit by  7 a.m. Hawaii time.<BR>Q12: While we do not produce an inpatient HER product, we would like to know if they are interested in receiving recommendations for dat a integration and interoperability with almbulatory care centers.  We would welcome the opportunity to help them consider the next step of information exchange, so that the first step they take will be in the right direction.<BR>R12: The government does no t want to expand the scope outside of what was requested<BR>

At the present time, the acquisition is expected to be issued as a small business set aside.     However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305 if your firm is HUBZone certified or a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to tomeka.evans@uscg.mil or by fax at (757) 628-4676.  In your response you must include: (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contact and telephone numbers.  At least two references are requested, but more are desirable.  Your response is required by December 28, 2007 at 4:30 pm, EST.

Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business Set-Aside, FAR 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business set aside or Small Business set-aside.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in an unrestricted acquisition.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone,  SDVOSB set-aside, or small business set-aside, will be posted in the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Questions may be referred to Ms. Tomeka Evans at (757) 628-4666.

Means bare cost for the parks located in Arizona: Canyon De Chelly National Monument, Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, Chiricahua National Monument, Coronado National Memorial, Fort Bowie National Historic Site, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Grand Canyon National Park, Hohokam Pima National Monument, Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site, Montezuma Castle National Monument, Navajo National Monument, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Petrified Forest National Park, Rainbow Bridge National Monument, Saguaro National Park, Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, Tonto National Monument, Tumacýcori National Historical Park, Tuzigoot National Monument, Walnut Canyon National Monument, and Wupatki National Monument.  The anticipated location workloads will dictate the need for either single or multiple awards at each location.  Multiple parks within the same geographical location might be consolidated into a single contract.  All awards will have minimum guarantees of $10,000 to $100,000 with maximum limits of $3,000,000 to $10,000,000 over the life of the contract depending on the park location and the projected construction workload.  Contracts will be awarded for one base and four possible option years.  The NAICS will be 236220 or 237990.  It is contemplated that the technical evaluations will give a price/technical trade-off preference to contractors' proficient in estimating using the R.S. Means.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine the social economic status of interested contractors to help determine if any or all of the awards should be set-aside for a targeted economic group.  All interested contractors should respond with their social economic status, bonding capacity, capabilities, past experience, workforce location, which parks they would be interested in supporting, and anything else they would like us to consider when preparing the solicitation.  Please limit your response to a 5 page word document or a 2 page email.  We do not want lengthy company brochures or excessively large electronic files.

Description:

Satellite Control and Network Systems Group intends to issue a delivery order for the procurement of up to four (4) L-band RBC HPAs and four (4) S-band for the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN).  The proposed action will be awarded to the existing Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC) F04701-02-D-0006, which is a cost-plus-award fee contract for the satellite and network control services and support.  The reason for this notice is because the original ordering period on the SCNC contract expired due to Government funding constraints and the complexity of the RBC HPA development. 

The RBC HPA is a key component in the RBC system design, allowing for the amplification and transmission of AFSCN modulation formats in the L-band uplink frequency band of 1.755-1.850 Gigahertz (GHz) (Space-Ground Link Subsystem [SGLS] Commanding, SGLS Ranging, Binary Subcarrier Commanding, and Pulse Code Modulation [PCM]/Phase Modulation [PM]), as well as modulation formats specific to Unified S-Band (USB) in the S-band uplink frequency band of 2.025-2.110 GHz (USB Subcarrier Commanding and USB Tone Ranging).  Both frequency bands must support an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power of 104 dBm for nominal and 110 dBm for enhanced configurations.  The AFSCN is the Department of Defense?s primary network for supporting launch and early orbit operations.  The AFSCN provides telemetry, tracking, and commanding capability, mission data dissemination and processing, and is one of the nation?s primary high-powered networks for emergency recovery of space vehicles.

The AFSCN currently consists of legacy Automatic Remote Tracking Stations (ARTS) and is in the middle of a modernization to state-of-the-art tracking stations known as the Remote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC).  There are 5 RBC projects currently on contract that will require new L/S-band HPAs.  The new RBC HPA will replace the legacy ARTS HPA.  The award of this delivery order is vital to ensuring uninterrupted operational capability to our AFSCN users.  Delays to the modernization effort will result in the loss of satellite contacts and decrease commanders' ability to communicate with the battlefield.  This new RBC HPA will include, but not be limited to, the following deliverables:

1.	Project Management
2.	Project Systems Engineering
3.	Configuration Management
4.	Procurement
5.	Production
6.	System Integration, Assembly, Checkout, and Shipping
7.	Test and Evaluation
8.	Data & Documentation
9.	Integration Logistics Support
10.	Environmental Engineering Compliance

The value for these supplies and services is limited to the acquisition of up to four (4)    L-band HPAs estimated at $11,000,000 combined total.

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine the extent of whether potential offerors exist who are capable of achieving the program objectives within acceptable cost, performance and schedule parameters.  Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. (HTSI) was awarded the Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC) in December 2001 and is presently on contract for development of the Pre-Production L-band RBC HPA.  The intent of the Pre-production unit was to establish the proof of concept for the HPA.  The Government anticipates a sole source award to the incumbent contractor, HTSI, but all responsible sources may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) that will be considered by the Government.  The expected contract award date is the second quarter of fiscal year 2008.  

Responsible sources interested in this notice may submit their SOC, with documented evidence of their capability to meet all technical, performance, and schedule requirements

Include a list of Point of Contacts (POC) with phone numbers and email addresses.  5) Personnel and Facilities:  Description of ability to provide qualified personnel and facilities to work at the appropriate security level.  6) Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Cost Estimate for development of an L-band HPA:  Explain cost savings expected due to realization of learning curve.  7) Detailed description of how integration with the existing Honeywell RBCs, without redesign of the RBC system, will be accomplished, performed, and implemented.   

All responses must be signed, scanned, and submitted by email to the Points of Contact (POCs) listed below in MS Word or PDF format, conform to 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with no smaller than 12 point font.  All responses are to be unclassified and should not exceed fifty (50) one-sided pages.  The Government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.  

All submitted SOCs will be evaluated to establish a pool of sources capable of supporting this requirement; small businesses that submit a SOC should indicate if they are interested as either potential prime contractor or subcontractor.  The Government will then determine extent of competition based on, but not limited to, availability of responsible qualified sources and integration capabilities.  This determination is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The selection of one or more sources for determination of competition will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's SOC to determine the overall merit of capability.  The SOCs will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance:  1) Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV).  2) Ability to deliver the First Article L-band (104 dBm) HPA by 8 September 2008.  3) Capability of meeting requirements and performance parameters as listed in the attachments.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy (DoN), Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) (www.cnic.navy.mil), is conducting preliminary planning to determine whether competitive sourcing, under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A -76 (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_incl_tech_correction.html) and consistent with the President?s Management Agenda (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2002/mgmt.pdf), is the optimal methodology for sourcing the issuance of Common Access Cards (CAC) and Teslin Cards via the Real-Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS) presently performed by military, civilian, and contractor personnel at CNIC Pay/Personnel Administrative Support System Services (PASS) Personnel Support Detachments (PSD) and Customer Support Detachments (CSD) and CNIC Installation Security Department Pass & ID Offices throughout the world.  A tentative list of PASS PSD/CSD and Security Department RAPIDS Site locations, which are subject to further refinement under the current OMB Circular A-76 preliminary planning effort, is set forth in Attachment 1. 

 This Request for Information (RFI), which is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise pay for the information solicited, is intended to seek industry assistance in determining whether there is sufficient industry interest and demonstrated capability to compete for these activities to support a decision to pursue competitive sourcing as the strategic sourcing solutions.  Please note that this market research is a follow-on to that originally posted via FedBizOpps.Gov on 13 Jun 07 (reference number N69450-07-R-0568) in which CAC/Teslin issuance was originally included in the overall scope of the Pay/Personnel Administrative Support System Services (PASS) study but has since, for programmatic reasons, been separated as it?s own study under OMB Circular A-76.  Note also that for CONUS and OCONUS operations, only United States Citizens, as defined by DOD 5200.2-R, are authorized to issue CAC and Teslin Cards via RAPIDS and must undergo and receive a favorable National Agency Check with Law Check and Credit (NACLC)/Access National Agency Check with Inquiries (ANACI) prior to performing the issuance function.  Interested parties are requested to complete and return via email the Attachment 2 CNIC CAC/Teslin Market Research Questionnaire no later than 4:00 PM Eastern, 3 Jan 08.  E-mail responses should be sent to the attention of the Contracting Officer, Ms. Candice Borden, at candice.borden@navy.mil.  If you have questions concerning this RFI, please contact Ms. Borden at 843-820-5945.  Your participation in this market research endeavor is greatly appreciated and will be instrumental in assisting CNIC in making the right competitive sourcing decision.

<CONTACT>Thomas Bouchard, (508) 233-4026
<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center (NSC), on behalf of the Joint Project Manager - Individual Protection (JPM-IP) is conducting a market survey for technical information from vendors of developmental and commercially available materials, components,  items and/or systems that could be utilized to provide percutaneous chemical biological individual protection (CB-IP).  This market survey will supplement information obtained from previous solicitations including USA-SNOTE-070322-009 [Lightweight Chemica l-Biological Protective Garment (LCBPG)] and W911QY07RMJP1 (CB Protective Aircrew).  Information provided in response to these previous solicitations does not need to be re-submitted.  Information will be used to support trade space analysis related to avi ation, ground, and shipboard CB-IP materials, components, end items, and design concepts and will be used to help shape the next-generation Joint Chemical Ensemble (JCE).  The JPMIP is interested in enhancing overall system performance in the areas of the rmal burden reduction, improved sweat management, reduction of overall weight and bulk, improved mobility, and improved tactility and dexterity (handwear and footwear).  The desired end-state is to fully integrate CB protection into the combat duty uniform .   <BR><BR>Evolving multi-tiered CB protection requirements indicate the need to identify, develop and field a family of technologies and end items that either singly, or in combination with other technologies and end items, meet the varying mission speci fic requirements across the broad warfighter spectrum.  The key to success is the balance among factors related to  CB protection [Chemical Warfare/Biological Warfare (CW/BW) agents and Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs), challenge levels and protection tim e, environmental effects, operational contaminant effects, etc.], physiological burden (thermal stress, mobility restriction, comfort, tactility and dexterity), logistics (durability, launderability, reparability, shelf life, weight and volume, storage req uirements), and cost.  Focus of the trade space analysis will be based on the specific threat and mission profiles. The need for a wide range of operational capabilities is anticipated including CB protection against challenge levels from 1 to 10 grams/m2 liquid and 500 to 5000 mg-min/m3 vapor and aerosol (across an operationally representative threat profile).  Additionally, protection time ranging from 8 to 24 hours is anticipated.   <BR><BR>Any and all CB related IP technologies including disposables, tr aditional CB limited service life items (15-45 days), and full military service life items (replacement for standard duty uniforms) are of interest (foreign and domestic).  Products that support mounted (air and ground vehicle), dismounted (ground and ship board), and amphibious assault/littoral operations are of interest. Multi-functional products are highly desirable (e.g. anti-exposure + CB; flame retardant  + CB; anti-microbial + CB, etc.). Ultimate end items of interest include undergarments, overgarmen ts, duty uniforms, handwear, footwear, and hoods). Vapor only protective products are of interest.  In a departure from previous military CB-IP, the next generation solution will not necessarily have to function under all threat scenarios or mission profil es.  Tailored solutions are of interest.  <BR><BR>Respondents should focus on describing their products with respect to how they contribute to the desired non-CB protection enhancements and factors identified above along with identifying the level and type  of CB protection offered (identify CW/BW agents and /or TICs addressed, challenge levels and protection time, environmental effects, operational contaminant effects, etc.).  Respondents should also include a detailed description of the product/material te chnology, actual or estimated unit cost, any available test results (including test method utilized) which demonstrate the trade space analysis factors identifi ed above, current users/product applications, status of manufacturing and production, and any unique or proprietary construction requirements related to the products.   For developmental products, estimated Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for both the dev elopmental material and the fabrication method of the material technology should also be included. <BR><BR>This is a market survey and is not a pre-solicitation notice. Nothing shall be construed herein or through the market survey process to commit or obl igate the U.S. Government to further action as a result of this market survey.  Firms responding to this market survey shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned to the submitter. <BR><BR>Respondents must submit their product brochures, technical data, or other information concerning performance and cost by COB on 29 February 200 8.   Submit data/information to Natick Research Development and Engineering Center (Attention Joint Shield Cell, D215) AMSRD-NSC-WS-TJ, Kansas St, Natick Ma 01760.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Fan Folded Self-Stick Note Value Pack with Dispenser to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>Proposed addition of Fan Folded Self-Stick Note Value Pack with Dispenser to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.

This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of a street broom by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Fan Folded Self-Stick Note Value Pack with Dispenser 
7530-00-NIB-0851


The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, New York.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Fan Folded Self-Stick Note Value Pack with Dispenser to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

MMM-PRO100VP ? 3x3 canary yellow fanfold self-stick notes with free dispenser 
MMM-DS330-SSVA ? Neon Super Sticky Notes with free dispenser
MMM-PRO100-SKPB ? Assorted Notes & Flags Starter Kit with free dispenser
MMM-DS100-SKPB ? Assorted Notes & Flags Starter Kit with free dispenser
MMM-DS330-VA ? Self-Stick Notes, Aquatic colors, with free dispenser
MMM-PRO330 ? Dispenser w/one yellow 3x3 pad
MMM-PRO330-FE-PA ? 3x3 designer color pads, flowered dispenser
MMM-PRO330-FE-WC - 3x3 designer color pads, flowered dispenser

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Fan Folded Self-Stick Note Value Pack with Dispenser to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than January 16, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<SUBJECT>SAFE TRIP-21, Safe and Efficient Travel through Innovation and Partnerships in the 21st Century
<DESC>Request for Information - Response Date: Jan 11, 2008.  The United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) Research and Innovative Technology Administrations (RITA), Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, is requesting information from the public and private sectors and academia, related to current efforts to launch an integrated, multi-modal, multi-application field test of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technologies designed to reduce traffic-related fatalities and injuries, fight congestion on Americas roadways and improve performance of the transportation system. SAFE TRIP-21, Safe and Efficient Travel through Innovation and Partnerships for the 21st Century, will be unveiled to the public during the 2008 World Congress on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in New York City from November 16-20.  SAFE TRIP-21 aims to expand and accelerate the U.S. DOT Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) initiative, and builds upon research into the use of sophisticated information, navigation, and communications technologies to further national transportation goals.  Through SAFE TRIP-21, the Department will help further the acceptance and adoption of technologies designed to prevent vehicle crashes and alleviate congestion in both urban and rural settings by providing drivers and transit and commercial motor vehicle operators with real-time safety warnings, traffic, transit, and traveler information, and navigational tools.  In 2006, there were 6 million traffic crashes in the U.S., injuring just under 2.6 million people.  In the same year, a crash occurred every 5 seconds, someone sustained a traffic-related injury every 12 seconds, and someone died in a traffic crash every 12 minutes.  The Nations urban congestion problem resulted in 4.2 billion hours of travel delay, 2.9 billion gallons of wasted fuel, and a net urban congestion cost of nearly $80 billion, according to a 2007 Texas Transportation Institute report.  Today, highway vehicle travel accounts for 81% of total U.S. transportation energy consumption.  In the face of growing concern about global warming, reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in the transportation sector is one of the major challenges for the U.S.  Through this Request for Information, the U.S. DOT/RITA seeks input regarding applications that are oriented toward safety, mobility, environmental stewardship, energy independence, and security and are now ready for testing and integration into a field test environment. This request seeks ideas and information as U.S. DOT/RITA works to enhance SAFE TRIP-21 testing environments at the 2008 ITS World Congress and elsewhere.  Additionally, those interested in partnering with the U.S. DOT during the 2008 World Congress on ITS while simultaneously working together to sustain a presence in a test bed environment at other U.S. locations are encouraged to respond regarding ways in which their involvement could further the objectives of  SAFE TRIP-21.   SAFE TRIP-21 will build upon lessons learned in proof-of-concept tests now underway through a number of partnerships involving automakers and equipment suppliers, Federal, state and local governments, and academia, in Michigan, California, Virginia, Florida, Arizona, Minnesota, New York and other locations around the nation.   SAFE TRIP-21 will also work to leverage efforts of two premier programs of the U.S. DOT; the Urban Partnership Agreements and the Corridors of the Future Program as well as other U.S. DOT efforts initiated to further advance national transportation goals. Responses will be treated as information only. This request for information is issued for the purpose of obtaining information and data that will be used to help showcase current ITS technology in a field test environment.  Appropriately marked proprietary information, submitted as a result of this RFI, will be received and protected accordingly by the U.S. Government. Interested parties are requested to submit written responses to this RFI by close of business 11 January 2008. It is highly encouraged that all information submitted be provided electronically, preferably in either Microsoft Word format or Portable Document Format (PDF) to the following e-mail address: SAFETRIP@volpe.dot.gov.

<DESC>The U. S. Naval War College has a requirement for a one-year membership in the Santa Fe Institute, a non-profit research organization that uses multidisciplinary collaboration to study behavior and structure of complex systems, with emphasis on complex systems that exhibit adaptation and learning.  Santa Fe Institute's research into computer simulation systems builds on a broad base of studies in complex adaptive systems.  The simulation programs, and more general computational approaches, are built on the concept of adaptive agents capable of learning in response to experience.  Many of the approaches incorporate processes that mimic biological systems and organisms, including mutation, generic crossover, evolution and co-evolution, and differential retention of successful genotypes. Areas of work include use of genetic algorithms, classifier systems, neural networks, genetic programming and other related machine learning methods. This award will provide CNO-Strategic Studies Group (CNO-SSG) participation in the Santa Fe Institute Business Network for Complex Systems Research for a period of one year.  Naval War College representatives will participate in research visits, workshops, technical meetings and seminars, and receive copies of working papers and books resulting from these research programs.  This purchase is considered sole source to Santa Fe Institute.  Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  Request for information should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Naval War College, 686 Cushing Road, Newport, RI  02841-1207, Attn:  Ginny Reedenauer

_____DESCRIPTION:
I.	GENERAL
BACKGROUND
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.  The NLRB has two principal functions:  
(1) 	to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and 
(2) 	to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions.  
The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 51 Regional, Sub-regional, or Resident Offices.
The Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC, is responsible for the planning, development, coordination, and execution of a comprehensive procurement program for the purchase of open market and other sources, and/or lease of diversified types of supplies and services.  The Contracts and Procurement Section also provides a centralized acquisition office for the NLRB for its Headquarters and 51 Field Offices.

            Department of Health and Human Services
            Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
	Office of Acquisition and Grants Management
	            
2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.
	
This justification seeks authority to negotiate two (2) non-competitive commercial items contracts for software license maintenance and support with Sterling Commerce for Connect:Direct (C:D), and Gentran Integration Suite (GIS), which are installed at CMS and the intermediary/carrier Medicare sites.  The applicable licenses will continue to allow CMS to support electronic file transfers.  The term for both contracts will be a one year base period, with four (4) one year optional periods.  The base period of performance for the C:D for OS390 (Mainframe) contract shall be from December 20, 2007 through December 19, 2008, with the optional periods running through December 19, 2012.  The base period for the C:D for Mid Tier UNIX and GIS contract shall be from January 20, 2008 through January 19, 2009, with the optional periods running through January 19, 2013.

3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Agency?s needs (including the estimated value).

These required contracts for software license maintenance support of the C:D for OS390 and Mid-tier UNIX, and GIS products will include licensing rights, maintenance, technical support, software defect fixes, new releases of software and upgrade protection during the period of performance.  

The estimated price for the two contracts is as follows:
?	C:D for OS 390, including the optional periods, is approximately $[redacted]. 
?	C:D for Mid Tier UNIX, and GIS, including the optional periods, is approximately $[redacted].
                   
4.	Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.

This justification is based upon the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency?s requirements. 

 
5. 	A demonstration that the proposed contractor?s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

C:D software is the industry standard for file transfer.  This product has been installed and is currently being used at CMS, state and other federal agencies, and all Medicare and Medicaid sites since 1987.  C:D is used to move data to support all CMS Medicare and Medicaid major business lines, including the following:

[Redacted]

This propriety software is critical to the success of CMS in administering the Medicare program, and the MMA.  The use of C:D is critical since it is already widely used, understood and deeply embedded in Medicare file exchanges.  In addition, Sterling?s GIS product, is seamlessly integrated into the current C:D based file transfer architecture at CMS.  Since C:D and GIS are proprietary products of Sterling, there are no other sources that meet the Government?s needs.  At the present time it is not possible to introduce a new contractor with an untested and potentially unreliable file transfer product. Any delay in awarding this order to Sterling will result in disruption to the processing of Medicare claims and potentially cause considerable harm to the Medicare program and its beneficiaries.  Sterling is the only responsible source that can provide the software maintenance, and upgrades necessary to fulfill the requirement to transmit Medicare data between CMS and the intermediary/carrier processing centers, within the timeframes the Agency requires.

6.         A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practical.

A synopsis, in accordance with the exception for the acquisition of commercial items authorized under FAR 5.203(a)(1) and FAR 5.203(b), will be published after the approval of this JOFOC.  Since this procurement is for brand name, proprietary products of Sterling Commerce, and Sterling does not have any authorized resellers of their products, CMS has determined that there are no other potential sources that can meet our requirements.       
 
7.	A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

[Redacted]

8.	Description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons why a market survey was not conducted.

In 2007, CMS evaluated several products as possible replacements for C:D.  Two were identified as technically meeting minimum requirements for CMS file transfer.  [Redacted]  While these products were technically capable of performing the file transfer minimum functions, the effort to convert an estimated thirty thousand file transfer jobs at CMS and the Medicare Processing Centers was deemed too technically difficult to implement and cost prohibitive to undertake.  In past discussions with the Gartner Group, it was determined that the best approach for business entities the size of CMS and the Medicare Contractor Data Centers is to continue using C:D and negotiate the best financial arrangement with Sterling.  This has become the Office of Information Services (OIS) posture for file transfer.  With the purchase of Sterling?s GIS, which tightly couples with the C:D product to exchange files with CMS business partners over the Internet, C:D became more deeply embedded in core CMS business functions and very difficult to replace.  CMS will continue to monitor technical literature and trade journals for future trends in comparable file transfer products.

9.	Other factors supporting the use of other than full and open competition:

Additional factors supporting this JOFOC are:
?	There are imbedded software references in programming that crosses all Tier levels. The impact of having to re-program this software would be extremely time and resource consuming.
?	The cost to replace the existing File Transfer software is estimated to be over $[Redacted]. 
?	There would be an additional cost to the Consolidated Information Technology Infrastructure Contract (CITIC) staff to facilitate any conversion from one file transfer software vendor to another that is not directly provided for in the CITIC support contract.
?	Finally, there is the impact on the transporting of data.  CMS has a tremendous responsibility to provide the most proven file transfer software available, that cannot be jeopardized by incorporating an unproven file transfer product.

10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:

A synopsis, in accordance with the exception for the acquisition of commercial items authorized under FAR 5.203(a)(1) and FAR 5.203(b), will be published after the approval of this JOFOC.   Any responses received will be properly evaluated. 

11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any substantial acquisition for the supplies or services required:

As with all hardware and software architecture, OIS will continue its evaluation of the file transfer software products referred to in Item 8 for functionality, systems value, and overall benefit to the Agency and its directives.  Although the migration to other file transfer software and the associated conversion of workloads at CMS and the Medicare Processing Centers was deemed to be cost-prohibitive at this time, OIS will continue to monitor trade journals and analyze comparable file transfer products for a potential replacement in the future.


Offers must be received by 3:00 p.m., December 28, 2007, and should be emailed to Lacetta.Bowman@cms.hhs.gov and Donald.Knode@cms.hhs.gov

I.	BACKGROUND

This procurement is being conducted for the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Chemical Sciences and Technology Laboratory (CSTL), Physical and Chemical Properties Division (PCPD) in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

A collection of about 10,000 reference MS-MS spectra has become a part of the NIST/NIH/EPA mass spectral library (http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist1.htm). The main target for enhancement is metabolites and peptides derived from proteins and synthetically made.

This involves:

a) Measurement of high quality MS-MS spectra of metabolites and peptides,
b) Analysis of spectral data,
c) Micro-synthesis of compounds of interest when needed,
d) Establishment of computer tools for the quality control for MS-MS spectra, and
e) Testing and development of applications of this data and metadata.
 
 The specific needs addressed in this order are related to the necessity for obtaining high quality MS-MS spectra of metabolites, peptides and related substances and for developing software tools for analysis of these spectra

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment to BAA W911W6-08-R-0002 is to publish all questions and responses received and provided to date since previous amendment #02 (posted November 28,2007). <BR><BR>QUESTION: Topic 01-2008 calls for 'at least 7% improvement i n hover-out-of-ground-effect performance'. Is this a 7% improvement in rotor thrust or an increase in overall vehicle lift which could be achieved by reductions in airframe download? <BR><BR>RESPONSE:  For this topic, the Government is interested only in r otor technologies that improve hover performance. The solicitation states Rotor blade technologies that, when implemented on a field vehicle, improve system level performance but require minimal changes to other existing systems and do not adversely affec t rotor durability are of interest.<BR><BR>QUESTION: Can you provide a description of the baseline blade design (i.e. material, shape, size, etc.) along with current life requirements and allowable BDAR limits, or may we base a proposal on the blade desig n for an existing Army Aviation helicopter?<BR><BR>RESPONSE: The Government expects an Offeror-selected baseline Army helicopter to be chosen to develop and demonstrate an integrated durable rotor blade for an improvement-by-spares upgrade concept for t he Current Force.  Therefore, the Government's intent is for the Offeror to base the proposal on a blade design for an existing Army aviation helicopter chosen by the Offeror.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  How is the increase in rotor OGE performance evaluated - by d ecrease in torque required to hover, increased load capacity, etc?<BR><BR>RESPONSE:  Yes, as stated in the solicitation, Improve rotor performance (at least 7% improvement in hover out of ground effect performance) with minimal required changes to other e xisting systems (i.e. rotor hub, drive system or airframe).  How this is verified is an exercise for the offeror.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  What is the current life of rotor blades in sand and rain erosion environments? The goal is stated to be 1000 hrs.<BR><BR>R ESPONSE:  Depending on the ambient erosive environment, current rotor erosion protection systems may only last on the order of 10 to 100 hours.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  What are the de-icing requirements for Army aircraft? Is it a surface temperature, specific pa rt of the blade that must be heated, time to temperature, expected life, etc.?<BR><BR>RESPONSE:  As stated in the solicitation, When compared to an Offeror-selected baseline Army helicopter, the improvements to existing main and tail rotor systems will:& Provide de-ice/ anti-ice solution that meets or exceeds the life requirement of the baseline blade. And, A reliable, maintainable de-ice/anti-ice solution is desired. How this is achieved depends solely on the offerors approach.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  What is the current baseline for BDA and repair for the rotor blades? The goal is to increase it by at least 100%. Is this based on lift, amount of damaged area, fatigue limits, etc?<BR><BR>RESPONSE:  The baseline for BDAR depends on the offeror-selected baseli ne rotor blade.  Reference must be made to the respective aircraft maintenance manuals.  As stated in the solicitation: Numerous blades are retired in theater after receiving only minor damage, because the current published allowable damage criteria (airc raft maintenance manuals) for main rotor blades are stringent. <BR><BR>QUESTION:  The BAA mentions that the designs should require minimal changes to existing airframes. How is minimal quantified? Is this based on mechanical complexity, cost, etc.?<BR><BR >RESPONSE:  As stated in the solicitation, AATD seeks to develop and demonstrate an integrated durable rotor blade& through an improvement-by-spares upgrade concept for the Current Force.  Also, Rotor blade technologies that, when implemented on a field  vehicle, improve system level performance but require minimal changes to other existing [non-rotor blade] systems and do not adversely affect rotor durability,  are of interest. Potential technologies include, but are not limited to, tailored rotor blades to exploit couplings available with composite materials, advanced blade planforms and/or tip shapes, and advanced airfoils.  The intent is to meet the requirem ents of the solicitation through blade design and not through changes to the airframe.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  Does the Army want a blade that is a silver bullet approach (requires no maintenance until replacement) or a blade that is maintainable over time?<BR ><BR>RESPONSE:  The Army realizes that there is no magic/silver bullet and that any resulting rotor blade will require maintenance over time.  As stated in the solicitation: A reliable, maintainable de-ice/anti-ice solution is desired. And: Improved D urability and Damage Tolerance methodology and lightweight ballistic tolerance technology development is required to establish expanded rotor damage and repair criteria that can be implemented in the field for continued flight. <BR><BR>QUESTION:  If selec ted to participate in funded activities, how is intellectual property protected? Does the DFARS 252.227-7013 cover all aspects of the intellectual property aspect of the BAA submission?<BR><BR>RESPONSE:  As stated in the solicitation, The Government desir es, at a minimum, Government Purpose Rightsas defined by the DFARS 252.227-7013, to all technical data, deliverables, and computer software to be delivered.  It is the offeror's responsibility to clearly acknowledge or take exception to the Governments d esire for at least Government Purpose Rights.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  Regarding Solicitation Topic 01-2008, can you please clarify if the solicitation is requesting program pricing for Year 1 or program Pricing for Years 1 - 4? Also, should an award be made, wi ll it be for Year 1 only and subsequent proposals will be required for follow on year activity?<BR><BR>RESPONSE:  As stated in the solicitation, the period of performance is not to exceed 42 months (39 months technical work, 3 months final report). Therefo re, the Government is expecting a proposal with program pricing for the entire effort (not to exceed 42 months). Subsequent proposals will not be required for each year's effort. <BR><BR><BR>

The solicitation states Rotor blade technologies that, when implemented on a field vehicle, improve system level performance but require minimal changes to other existing systems and do not adversely affec t rotor durability are of interest.<BR><BR>QUESTION: Can you provide a description of the baseline blade design (i.e. material, shape, size, etc.) along with current life requirements and allowable BDAR limits, or may we base a proposal on the blade desig n for an existing Army Aviation helicopter?<BR><BR>RESPONSE: The Government expects an Offeror-selected baseline Army helicopter to be chosen to develop and demonstrate an integrated durable rotor blade for an improvement-by-spares upgrade concept for t he Current Force.  Therefore, the Government's intent is for the Offeror to base the proposal on a blade design for an existing Army aviation helicopter chosen by the Offeror.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  How is the increase in rotor OGE performance evaluated - by d ecrease in torque required to hover, increased load capacity, etc?<BR><BR>RESPONSE:  Yes, as stated in the solicitation, Improve rotor performance (at least 7% improvement in hover out of ground effect performance) with minimal required changes to other e xisting systems (i.e. rotor hub, drive system or airframe).  How this is verified is an exercise for the offeror.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  What is the current life of rotor blades in sand and rain erosion environments? The goal is stated to be 1000 hrs.<BR><BR>R ESPONSE:  Depending on the ambient erosive environment, current rotor erosion protection systems may only last on the order of 10 to 100 hours.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  What are the de-icing requirements for Army aircraft? Is it a surface temperature, specific pa rt of the blade that must be heated, time to temperature, expected life, etc.?<BR><BR>RESPONSE:  As stated in the solicitation, When compared to an Offeror-selected baseline Army helicopter, the improvements to existing main and tail rotor systems will:& Provide de-ice/ anti-ice solution that meets or exceeds the life requirement of the baseline blade. And, A reliable, maintainable de-ice/anti-ice solution is desired. How this is achieved depends solely on the offerors approach.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  What is the current baseline for BDA and repair for the rotor blades? The goal is to increase it by at least 100%. Is this based on lift, amount of damaged area, fatigue limits, etc?<BR><BR>RESPONSE:  The baseline for BDAR depends on the offeror-selected baseli ne rotor blade.  Reference must be made to the respective aircraft maintenance manuals.  As stated in the solicitation: Numerous blades are retired in theater after receiving only minor damage, because the current published allowable damage criteria (airc raft maintenance manuals) for main rotor blades are stringent. <BR><BR>QUESTION:  The BAA mentions that the designs should require minimal changes to existing airframes. How is minimal quantified? Is this based on mechanical complexity, cost, etc.?<BR><BR >RESPONSE:  As stated in the solicitation, AATD seeks to develop and demonstrate an integrated durable rotor blade& through an improvement-by-spares upgrade concept for the Current Force.  Also, Rotor blade technologies that, when implemented on a field  vehicle, improve system level performance but require minimal changes to other existing [non-rotor blade] systems and do not adversely affect rotor durability,  are of interest. Potential technologies include, but are not limited to, tailored rotor blades to exploit couplings available with composite materials, advanced blade planforms and/or tip shapes, and advanced airfoils.  The intent is to meet the requirem ents of the solicitation through blade design and not through changes to the airframe.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  Does the Army want a blade that is a silver bullet approach (requires no maintenance until replacement) or a blade that is maintainable over time?<BR ><BR>RESPONSE:  The Army realizes that there is no magic/silver bullet and that any resulting rotor blade will require maintenance over time.  As stated in the solicitation: A reliable, maintainable de-ice/anti-ice solution is desired. And: Improved D urability and Damage Tolerance methodology and lightweight ballistic tolerance technology development is required to establish expanded rotor damage and repair criteria that can be implemented in the field for continued flight. <BR><BR>QUESTION:  If selec ted to participate in funded activities, how is intellectual property protected? Does the DFARS 252.227-7013 cover all aspects of the intellectual property aspect of the BAA submission?<BR><BR>RESPONSE:  As stated in the solicitation, The Government desir es, at a minimum, Government Purpose Rightsas defined by the DFARS 252.227-7013, to all technical data, deliverables, and computer software to be delivered.  It is the offeror's responsibility to clearly acknowledge or take exception to the Governments d esire for at least Government Purpose Rights.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  Regarding Solicitation Topic 01-2008, can you please clarify if the solicitation is requesting program pricing for Year 1 or program Pricing for Years 1 - 4? Also, should an award be made, wi ll it be for Year 1 only and subsequent proposals will be required for follow on year activity?<BR><BR>RESPONSE:  As stated in the solicitation, the period of performance is not to exceed 42 months (39 months technical work, 3 months final report). Therefo re, the Government is expecting a proposal with program pricing for the entire effort (not to exceed 42 months). Subsequent proposals will not be required for each year's effort. <BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>THIS AMENDMENT IS ISSUED TO PROVIDE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. THE CLOSING DATE AND TIME FOR QUOTATIONS REMAINS UNCHANGED.  QUESTIONS AND ANSERWS ARE AS FOLLOWS CLIN 0001:  QUESTION 1: Are the high humidity levels going to always be above 32F? Answer: Yes .  QUESTION 2: Where will the 15 HP condenser be located? Answer: The chamber is going to be next to an interior wall and refrigerant will run to the condenser outside the building (estimating 10 feet).  QUESTION 3: Will the government be responsible to un load and place the equipment at your installation site? Answer: An overhead crane can be provided and operated by the government to remove the chamber from the truck and sit it in place. The contractor will be responsible for installation of the condenser,  refrigerant piping and all other services required for chamber operation. QUESTION 4: Is the chamber to be outdoors? Answer: No. It will be indoors. QUESTION 5: If indoors, what are the dimensions of the doors or hallways to where the chamber will be loca ted? Is a drawing available? Answer: A drawing can not be provided for security reasons. However, the facility resembles an open warehouse. A large roll up door will allow a tractor trailer to enter building and pull right up to the final site installation  location.
