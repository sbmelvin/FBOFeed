<DESC>The posting amends an earlier synopsis entitled “Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) Support Services” which was posted on April 20, 2004, as a potential sole source action to the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Foundation, Akron, OH.   Information contained in the amendment is being provided to better describe the specific tasks associated with this project in an effort to assist alternative sources in determining whether they possess the qualifications to perform the work.  

BACKGROUND:  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is an incurable brain disorder that occurs with an incidence of 1 case per million annually. The majority of patients die within 6 months of illness onset. The disease causes damage to the brain leaving patients completely dependent on their caregivers for the most basic needs of daily living. The services provided through this project will greatly assist in achieving CDC’s goal of increasing the number of autopsies of suspected CJD cases, increasing public awareness about CJD, and providing support to CJD families. To date, the CJD Foundation has implemented several initiatives to provide support to CJD patients and their families. Maintaining a toll-free helpline to provide support to these family members from others who have gone through the same experience is extremely helpful. Creating a forum in which family members can receive assistance and discuss issues related to home and post-mortem care is crucial. The CJD Foundation Family Conference creates an additional forum that facilitates dialogue between researchers working on CJD and the family members. These discussions help researchers to gain more knowledge about the social impacts of the disease and exchange ideas on potential areas of research. Learning more about prion diseases through autopsy study of CJD cases would assist in the surveillance of potentially emerging forms of the disease and would facilitate the development of a pre-mortem diagnostic test or treatment for CJD. The CJD Foundation could play a key role in helping to increase the number of autopsies of CJD cases by educating family members and health care providers about the need for autopsy. This can be achieved through the production and distribution of informational booklets on “Guide for autopsy of suspected CJD cases.” 
 
PURPOSE:  This acquisition is to continue maintenance of a toll-free helpline that provides guidance and information to families of CJD patients and creating a forum in which families can exchange information. The service provided by the CJD Foundation should encourage family members of CJD patients to discuss the need for autopsy with the attending physician and increase family member’s awareness about the critical need for autopsy. Continued sponsorship of the CJD Foundation Family Conference will raise public awareness about CJD and provide prion disease researchers with an opportunity to share their work

SPECIFIC TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:  

A)  Maintain a toll-free helpline to provide:   1)  Information to family members of CJD patients about the disease to help them prepare for the eventual fatal outcome of the disease;   2)  A forum in which family members of CJD patients can network to share information with each other;  and  3)   guidance on various types of services (e.g., hospice, funeral home) that would be helpful to family members of CJD patients.

B)  Educate family members of CJD patients, produce a booklet on “Guide for autopsy of suspected CJD cases,” highlighting current barriers to autopsies and indicating why autopsies are needed and the need for family members to provide consent for autopsies. Such an information booklet could also highlight the fact that surveillance for emerging forms of CJD and progress in CJD research, particularly the development of a pre-mortem CJD test or treatment, heavily rely on learning more about the disease through autopsy studies of CJD cases.

C)  Educate health care workers and the public about CJD via a website,  teleconferences, meetings, and development of educational materials to:   1)  Increase awareness about the disease;  2)  Describe the need to conduct autopsy of suspected CJD cases to facilitate surveillance of the disease;  and  3)  Increase awareness about the state-of-the art free CJD diagnostic services provided by the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center.

D)  Sponsor a national conference that would bring together family members and   professionals working on prion diseases.
 
Through this announcement, alternate sources are being offered the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to provide the services specifically identified above.   
To be considered qualified, sources must submit a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that they possess at least 2 years of experience in delivering the kind of activities outlined in the SOW including:  facilitate interaction and provide support services to family members of CJD patients, educate family members to increase the low autopsy rate among CJD patients (an impediment to CDC's CJD surveillance activities), and bring together family members of CJD patients and CJD researchers to facilitate interactions on significant issues affecting family members that would advance applied CJD research and national surveillance programs.  Responses must contain no more than 10 pages total.    

Qualified organizations are encouraged to submit a capabilities statement which addresses the requirements and contains material in sufficient detail to allow the CDC to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capabilities are to be received in the contracting office no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this amended announcement.  Submit written information to:   Kimberly Groves, MS-1019, Reference:  0000HCRU-2004-08490, DHHS/PHS/CDC, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV  26505, or responses may be submitted electronically to Kimberly Groves at kpg0@cdc.gov.   

The intent of this synopsis is to determine whether alternative sources exist.  Information received will be used solely  for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   All responsible sources may submit a response, which shall be considered by the Agency.

<SUBJECT>B--Empirical Weathering Properties of Oil in Snow and Ice
<SOLNBR>0104AN34501
<RESPDATE>052804
<ARCHDATE>05062005
<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Business Specialist 7037871263     sharon.teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract to meet specific objectives of the study entitled Empirical Weathering Properties of Oil in Snow and Ice.  This study will make precise measurements regarding oil evaporation, spreading, and other behavior in and on ice and snow as functions of physical conditions and oil properties. The work may be done in any combination of small scale (cold room) laboratory, basin, or as experimental spills in sea ice or snow.  Both high and low pour-point crudes will be tested. The experimental data in concert with other oil-ice weathering data will be used to validate and enhance or develop new algorithms of oil weathering in ice and snow.  ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT: The government estimates a period of performance for this contract will be from 2004-2007 and a cost range of $600,000 to 700,000.  BACKGROUND: Oil spill weathering models are used in National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis as well as in Oil Discharge Prevention and Contingency Plans (ODPCPs). The results of these models are used to estimate impacts in the NEPA analysis and in pre-planning for oil spills. A modest amount of work in the field was done in the 1970's and 1980's on first-order physics for oil weathering in ice. Additional studies have continued in the laboratory in the late 1980's and 1990's, but were generally limited to low viscosity, low-pour-point oils.  We now know that oil weathering is strongly dependent on the specific chemical composition and properties of individual crudes.  The sort of  chemical-component-specific data required by modern state-of-the-art models such as the SINTEF (a Norwegian acronym which in English stands for The Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research at the Norwegian Institute of Technology) Oil Weathering Model used by MMS in Alaska  are  scarce, of poor quality or nonexistent for oil-ice interaction.  Such models, therefore, ignore the more difficult aspects of oil-in-ice weathering.  The sophisticated measurement techniques currently available would enable precise measurements regarding oil evaporation, spreading, and dispersion in ice, as well as on ice and in snow, as a function of oil type and chemistry.  SCOPE OF WORK:  TASK 1 - HOLD POST-AWARD CONFERENCE WITH MMS.  The Contractor shall hold a post-award conference with Alaska OCS Region staff within three weeks of contract award, to insure a clear understanding by all of study tasks, concerns, availability of specific crudes for testing, other relevant data and reports, coordination issues, and timelines.  The Contractor shall provide a draft agenda to participants prior to the meeting.  The Contractor shall provide a Meeting Summary to participants within one week of meeting, and list any changes needed to planned work as a result of the meeting.  TASK 2 - SMALL SCALE STUDIES OF OIL BEHAVIOR IN SEA ICE AND SNOW.  Use quantitative techniques to measure how physical conditions interact with individual oils to affect oil behavior and weathering properties.  The work may be done in any combination of small scale (cold room) laboratory, basin, or as experimental spills in sea ice or snow.  However, it is important to have some knowledge about the oil properties before performing any field studies and results from the field should also be reproduced in the laboratory when the field work is completed. Economies of scale should be used to test a larger suite of oils in laboratory experiments.  Both high and low pour point crudes should be used.  Liberty and Endicott crudes are examples of high pour point crudes, with pour point close to ambient environmental temperatures.  Use of crudes characterized in prior laboratory or field testing may be advantageous, if the weathering properties are known under more regular (nonArctic) conditions.  Subtask 2A - Use quantitative techniques to measure spreading on and under ice and in snow.  Which oil properties affect stripping velocity (relative water velocity needed to move oil under ice) and equilibrium thickness of oil under the ice?  How are the stripping velocities affected by these oil properties?  How does the relationship between stripping velocity and these oil properties change for different ice roughnesses?  How do oil properties affect equilibrium oil thickness under the ice?  Quantitatively describe spreading of (cooled) oil at environmental temperatures on ice or in snow on ice.  Subtask 2B - Use quantitative techniques to measure evaporation in broken ice, on solid ice and in snow, down to cold temperatures, on the order of -30 to -40 degrees Centigrade.  Establish which and quantify how oil properties and physical environmental conditions (e.g.; percent ice cover, geometry of ice cover) affect evaporation in broken first-year ice.  Quantify how cold temperatures affect evaporation of oil on solid ice as a function of oil properties.  Quantify how snow cover over oil affects evaporation of oil.   Subtask 2C - Use quantitative techniques to measure slick thickness.  Evaluate whether thicker oil slicks will be formed in cold water because of higher oil viscosity (correlation of slick thickness with temperature and crude type/viscosity).  Subtask 2D - Use quantitative techniques to investigate vertical oil migration through brine channels.  Establish which and quantify how oil properties and physical environmental conditions affect ability of or timing of oil migration up brine channels to ice surface in first-year sea ice.  Subtask 2E - Use quantitative techniques to measure emulsification in broken ice. Establish which and quantify how oil properties and physical environmental conditions affect emulsification and water uptake in broken first-year ice.  Subtask 2F - Use quantitative techniques to measure corollary physical parameters and oil properties important to oil behavior and weathering in ice and snow.   TASK 3 - DATA ANALYSIS.  Use data from Task 2 to develop a dataset from the experimental data for use to validate weathering algorithms and oil weathering models in the presence of ice and snow.  TASK 4 - IMPROVEMENT OF OIL WEATHERING ALGORITHMS IN ICE AND SNOW.  Use these experimental data in concert with other oil-ice weathering data to validate and enhance or develop new algorithms of ice weathering in ice suitable for inclusion in oil-weathering models.  TASK 5 - PROGRAM AND DATA MANAGEMENT.  The Contractor shall operate under the program-management plan and data-management plan described in the Contractor's proposal.  The data-management plan shall ensure that all data are properly recorded, validated, made available to cognizant investigators for further analyses.  TASK 6 - REPORTING.  The contractor shall participate in an Alaska OCS Region Information Transfer Meeting (ITM).  The ITM would provide an honorarium and per diem and reimburse travel costs.  The Contractor shall submit quarterly progress (letter) reports to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).  The progress reports shall include: (1) a brief summary of all preceding work and overall progress made against the schedule, (2) a brief summary of any resolutions agreed to between Contractor and MMS regarding these problems, (3) a brief summary of significant technical, schedule, or cost problems encountered, including an assessment of their probable effects on meeting contract provisions, and (4) a list of all significant meetings held, consultations, or other contacts made in connection with the contract, including a brief summary of the participants and subject, date, location, and outcome of each such contact or meeting.  Any final field logistics plans with schedules and field reports shall be included in the appropriate quarterly reports.   The Contractor shall provide MMS with an Annual Technical Report describing the data obtained and initial Tasks 2-4 results.  A digital copy of the collated data shall be provided to MMS with the report.  These technical reports would each replace one of the quarterly reports.  The contractor shall complete and submit draft Final Report and Technical Summary to MMS for scientific and editorial review.  The report and summary should cover all technical Tasks. A copy of the standard MMS formatting requirements for technical summaries and cover/title page specifications for the report will be provided by MMS when requested after contract award.  The MMS shall review the draft report and summary and shall provide review comments to the Contractor within 30 to 45 days after receiving the draft documents.  The Contractor shall revise the Final Report and Technical Summary and complete as per review comments.  Provide the rationale in a letter accompanying the final report for any review comments not accommodated.  Provide 20 copies of the report, a high-quality master copy, and 20 PC-pdf digital copies to MMS on CD-ROM.  Resolution of pdf figures and tables should be sufficiently high so as to allow incorporation of their clear images into MS Powerpoint presentations.  Bibliographic citations for the final report should also be provided to MMS in ProCite 5or newer (or as a file directly importable into ProCite).   Provide a final Technical Summary, revised from the draft as per review comments and a PC-compatible digital copy in MS Word 6 or newer to MMS by email or on digital PC media.  TASK 7 -  PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF JOURNAL ARTICLE(S).  The contractor shall prepare and submit a scientific article(s) to a peer-reviewed journal(s).  Drafts of manuscripts will be provided to MMS prior to journal submittal.  Articles will summarize major objectives, methods, significant results, conclusions, and implications of the work.  Submission of multiple journal articles dealing with  auxiliary subjects matter is encouraged but not required.  If published, reprints shall be provided to MMS.  All journal articles must include MMS in the acknowledgments section and reference the agreement number to facilitate accession through the Environmental Studies Program Information System (ESPIS).  Because of the long lead time that is usual for scientific publication, the Contractor is encouraged to start on this submission in parallel with or prior to completion of the final report.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  This announcement is in response to a Request for Information (RFI) published on March 5, 2004 to identify potential small business concerns.  As a result of a review of information received, this requirement will be a 100% Small Business Set Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement would be 541710 "Oceanographic research and development laboratories or services" with a size standard of 500 employees.  NOTE: At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern.  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY: The use of specific habitat in the MMS Cook Inlet Multi-Sale Area by the ESA candidate beluga whale, and 5 baleen whale species including the threatened or endangered humpbacked, fin, sei, and right whales, and gray whales shall be studied using passive acoustic monitoring techniques.  Specific objectives of this study are: 1) to estimate the temporal and spatial patterns of variation in the vocalizations of beluga whales in key areas of Lower Cook Inlet in order to estimate the a) frequency and direction of passage of belugas past the eastern and western forelands, b) frequency and direction of passage of beluga whales between Cook Inlet and the Gulf of Alaska through Kennedy Entrance, Stevenson Entrance, and Shelikof Strait, and c) temporal patterns of use of Kamishak Bay by beluga whales; 2)  to estimate species specific, temporal and spatial patterns of variation in the vocalizations of baleen whales in the Barren Islands Deferral Area of the MMS Cook Inlet Multi-Sale Area, and to the extent possible, estimate temporal changes in the relative abundance of each species.  This study is envisioned to be a 3-year effort, including 2 years of field monitoring.  It will require the use of passive acoustic methods.  Such methods could include, but not necessarily be limited to, any combination of the following: ARPs (Autonomous Recording Packages), DIFAR (Directional Frequency Analysis and Recording) sonobuoys, continuous seafloor acoustic recorders, and hydrophone arrays with shore-based continuous recorders. A proven data management plan will be needed to ensure high quality data, lines of custody, archival, distribution and submittal to accepted data repositories.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC), 46th Test Wing/TSRS (Range Systems Branch), is contemplating awarding sole source, Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) procurements to Diebold, Inc., 5995 Mayfair Road, Canton, Ohio 44720 (contact Dana Little, 330-489-4240), the manufacturer of the AN/GSX-4 Anti-Intrusion Restricted Area Alarm Set, commonly referred to as the Automated Entry Control System (AECS).  The AECS is an integrated configuration of equipment that controls personnel and vehicle entry to and exit from secured, controlled areas, and monitors both exterior and interior security sensors to detect unauthorized entry, as well as report alarms, and log events.  Phase I of the AECS was installed by Diebold, Inc., under contract F08635-03-C-0012, and consisted of establishing a Central Security Control (CSC) with AECS and a Video Storage System including a master enrollment station; establishing an operator enrollment station at Pass and Registration; and integrating the Defense Satellite Communication System Security System to the AECS.  The Government does not own a Technical Data Package for the AECS and Phases II, III, and IV must be integrated and totally compatible with the existing hardware installed in Phase I (a 14 month effort), which is nearing completion.  Phase II of this project provides for the integration of the perimeter security system components to the AECS located in the CSC, and includes options for integrating the Space-Based Infrared System, four Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, and a medical/dental facility to the AECS.  Phase III provides for upgrading the Entry Control Points access control system and Phase IV provides for upgrading the Interior Intrusion Detection System.  Any offerors must be Protection Level 1 certified. 

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) intends to acquire on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition 200 ft. of Free-standing Coffer Dam/AquaDam that is 16’ high.  The Coffer Dam is open ended with extruded film tubing that is made of a woven polypropylene fabric used in high survivability separation applications.  The Aqua Dams are made from 70” plus, laid flat width panels of 6.5 oz. circular woven material.  Panel edges are overlapped then triple-stitched together using an overlapping seam for maximum strength.  This provides for a 4-ply seam running around the tube.  The material is folded over and then seamed laterally to form a tube.  The lateral seam is reinforced by sewing in 3” wide heavy-duty seat belt strapping material on each side of the seam to give it added strength and durability.  There are a total of six (6) seams, three in one direction and three in the other.  One of the triple-stitch seams uses high-tensile strength Kevlar thread, which makes an excellent 2-ply tube for the added pressure of these large water-filled Coffer Dams.  The 16’high Coffer Dam utilizes two- 2-ply tubes, which are used together for a total of 4-ply thickness.  The inside tubing can be completely replaced to make the Aqua Dam new again.  This is a Notice of Intent to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for the above items to Aqua Dams/WSV, P.O. Box 206, Carlotta, CA 95528, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The Coffer Dam will be used to test levees along the Rio Grande at the USIBWC Mercedes Field Office located at 325 Golf Course Road, Mercedes, TX  78570.  There is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency’s minimum needs can only be satisfied by the product provided by Aqua Dams.  The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  There is no solicitation document available.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, any and all proposals received by 5:00 p.m., MST, on May  14, 2004, will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Goddard Space Flight Center,(GSFC) intends to solicit proposals in support of the Earth Science Enterprise's (ESE's) Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) Program. The ESE acquires, processes and delivers very large (gigabyte to terabyte) volumes of remote sensing and related data to public and governmental entities for use in understanding and protecting our home planet.  These data are used to develop a scientific understanding of the earth system and its response to natural and human induced changes, and to enable improved prediction of climate, weather and natural hazards for present and future generations.  The AIST Program evolves a full range of technologies - from the space segment, where information pipeline begins, to the end user, where knowledge is advanced.  Information technologies are currently employed throughout the ESE's space and ground systems: from on-board satellite data acquisition, through space-to-ground transmission, ground-to-ground networks, and data capture and processing centers, to data and information distribution and analysis by end users. In order to promote a flexible and robust IT program for ESE, the AIST Program has established a process to respond to the rapid changes in the IT arena.	The AIST Program is releasing a Master NRA under which Mini-NRA solicitations will be periodically issued over the next 5 years from 2004 to 2009. The Master NRA NNG04ZY4000N provides the general guidelines for proposal submittal.  The Mini-NRA solicitations issued under the Master NRA will include their own list of proposed topics or questions of interest, background information, and any other pertinent data.  These Mini-NRA's will typically target short turn-around hardware and/or software technologies the AIST program office deems pertinent in the applications of ESE information systems.  The Master NRA and Mini-NRA will be available electronically on the release date, via the Internet at the ESTO home page at    http://esto.nasa.gov/    . The first Mini-NRA solicitation (NNGO4ZY4001N) is simultaneously released with this Master NRA, in which the AIST program office is seeking proposals addressing Data Mining Technologies.  This Mini-NRA solicitation provides additional details governing the proposed activities that supersede the general guidelines announced in the Master NRA.  Proposals are to be submitted electronically via the AIST Master NRA proposal sumbission e-Book accessible via the ESTO home page at    http://esto.nasa.gov/	.  This Mini-NRA solicitation will be open through July 6, 2004.  Proposers must read and follow the guidelines and procedures in both the Master NRA and the Mini-NRA solicitation. "Participation is open to all categories of organizations, foreign and domestic, including industry, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, NASA centers, and other Government agencies." "Electronically submitted Notices of Intent to propose are requested." "Proposal due date is July 6, 2004.   The electronic submission of each proposal's Cover Page/Proposal Summary/Budget Summary is required by the due date for proposal submission". "This is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 6.102 (d) (2)." Notwithstanding the posting of this opportunity at FedBizOpps.gov, Grants.gov, or at both sites, NASA reserves the right to determine the appropriate award instrument for each proposal selected pursuant to this announcement. The Technical Points of Contact are: Direct questions specifically regarding this solicitation to:  POC:  Karen Moe Phone: 301-286-2978 Email: Karen.L.Moe@nasa.gov

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Sociometrics Corporation, a small business, for a five-year project entitled, “Archiving of Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Research Data.”  This project is for the continued development, expansion, maintenance and distribution of the NATASHA and PASHA archives of data sets on adolescent pregnancy and pregnancy prevention.  The Contractor must 1)  identify appropriate new data sets for inclusion in the archives; 2) establish and manage a scientific review panel; 3) provide the scientific review panel with relevant information concerning the data sets; 4) work with data set owners to strip identifiers for the creation of totally anonymous information; and 5) convert the data sets into SPSS readable files consonant with the current archival data.  The Contractor will also continue to be responsible for training users of the archives and for publicity about the archives at appropriate venues.  The NICHD is not aware of other offerors who can perform the type of work that is required to continue the growth of this resource at a best-value cost.  Because of this, capability statements are requested from other organizations having the experience and resources available to meet the project needs, as indicated above (more information regarding the archives and data sets may be found at http://sociometrics.com/ and http://www.socio.com/data.htm ).  At this time, and unless adequate capability statements are received by June 21, 2004, it appears that inherent duplication of cost to the Government, unacceptable delays in the re-creation and necessary expansion of the archives and the proprietary nature of the formation of the product make competition unfeasible for this project.  This action is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  See Numbered Note 22 and/or interested parties may submit capability statements to the following address:  Virginia A. DeSeau, Contracting Officer, at vd9t@nih.gov , by fax to (301) 402-3676 or by mail to 6100 Building, Room 7A07, 6100 EXECUTIVE BLVD MSC 7510, BETHESDA MD 20892-7510; telephone: (301) 435-6947.

Background & Need:
The task of bringing science based interventions to the field of HIV prevention has been advanced by the CDC with its innovative projects, the Replicating Effective Programs (REP) project and the Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI) project.  The REP project packages interventions with evidence of effectiveness into easy understand and use designs which can be used by any agency to deliver an intervention that has been proven to reduce behaviors associated with HIV transmission.  These packages contain all intervention materials, manuals to guide their use, and marketing materials to promote the program.

Upon completion of each REP intervention package, the DEBI project is charged with ensuring that it is used in the field.  The DEBI strategy involves providing training for trainers that can teach the intervention to various community agencies, support for those trainings, and on-going technical assistance to agency implementers who choose to deliver the intervention.  This nationwide diffusion strategy involves the work of the original curricula writers and package designers who can train other trainers to deliver the intervention, additional trainers, and coaches who can address technical assistance needs to ensure appropriate delivery of the intervention.

CDC’s Advancing HIV Prevention initiative has emphasized addressing the prevention needs of PLWH using science-based programs.  The CDC endorsed this intervention further with Program Announcement 04064 that specifically stated that CBOs that serve HIV infected populations should implement this intervention with general populations of HIV infected persons. The stature of the CDC in national and international public health influences the direction of prevention initiatives throughout the US whether they are funded by CDC (through direct or indirect methods) or by other organizations.  Community organizations and their funders are looking to the CDC to provide guidance on the implementation of proven interventions for PLWH.  This contract shall be used to procure the materials, training, and on-going technical assistance for agencies wishing to deliver the Healthy Relationships intervention.  The Healthy Relationships intervention is the only intervention for a general population of people living with HIV that has is based in science and has been proven effective.

The diffusion of the Healthy Relationships intervention addresses CDCs goal of improving HIV prevention by bringing evidence-based interventions to the field of HIV preventions.

Scope of Work:

The contractor shall manage the diffusion of the Healthy Relationships intervention for interested community and non-governmental organizations and health departments.  This diffusion effort shall include developing a Healthy Relationships training curriculum and producing training materials for training of trainers, delivering a training of trainers, training of coaches, providing Technical Assistance Guides for all coaches, managing training for community agencies, and provision of materials.  Required personnel for this project include trainers with experience in curriculum development.

This training of trainers shall be appropriate for adult learners, and shall include a review of materials, a review of all sessions, demonstration of all intervention concepts, mock training sessions, and teach-backs at a minimum.  At the end of training, participants shall have all skills necessary to train agencies on the delivery of the Healthy Relationships intervention as evidenced by demonstration of training skills in the Healthy Relationships intervention materials.

Curriculum development for training of coaches, delivering a training of coaches, and production of a Technical Assistance Guide: The contractor shall conduct a training of coaches for the Healthy Relationships intervention.  The training shall prepare coaches to answer all technical assistance inquiries from agencies that have been trained to deliver the Healthy Relationships intervention.  The training shall be designed with adult learning principles in mind, and shall address the salient learning points of the Healthy Relationships intervention.

The contractor shall ensure that at each training every participant has a copy of the intervention package which shall include an implementer’s manual, 4 video clips, a marketing video, and a risk/stress continuum banner.  The contractor must print and provide for the training up to 600 intervention kits.  The contractor shall be responsible for shipping all training materials to each training site.

A waitlist of agencies who wish to receive training on Healthy Relationships will be managed by an external contractor funded through a pre-existing task order, the Academy for Educational Development (AED).  Agencies will sign up for training by visiting www.effectiveinterventions.org, the Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI) homepage.  AED will be responsible for scheduling agencies to receive training and for cooperating with the HIV/STD Prevention Training Centers and the focus area 2 Capacity Building Assistance (CBA) providers funded through CDC Program Announcement 04019 to plan the training.  The waitlist, including a listing of all agencies who have received training will be made available to CDC staff in the Prevention Program Branch and the Capacity Building Branch.  In this way the CDC project officer will be able to monitor the list to ensure that trainings are provided appropriately, and that agencies receive training in a timely manner.

<DESC>This is a notice that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to negotiate a Sole Source purchase order with Goldsim Technology Group LLC using the procedures in FAR Part 13.  This procurement is for the purchase of software licenses for GoldSim Pro with Radionuclide Transport (RT) Module which is a software package capable of simulating the performance assessment of complex sites.  The software package must be capable of considering uncertainties in a probabilistic manner, be highly flexible, and be driven by a graphical users interface to facilitate rapid incorporation of alternative physical processes.  The following requirements are necessary:  The software package must include pre-defined functions to model various physical processes including the release from source elements allowing for two-levels of containment and including user-defined release rates, sorption, radioactive decay and ingrowth, and solubility limits, the transport of radionuclides in mixing cells, pipe representations (unmixed compartments), and external or user-supplied transport paths including radioactive decay and ingrowth, sorption, advection, matrix diffusion (for fractured systems), and diffusion.  Uncertainty distributions provided with the software must include: Constant, Uniform, Triangular, Log-triangular, Normal, Log-normal, Beta, Gamma, Weibull, Poisson.  The model must include the capability for feedback loops in which the output of an element ultimately feeds back into the input to the element.  The software must include the capability to interface to user-supplied modules (such as Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs)).

The proposed action is an acquisition for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to this requirement. This notice is not a request for proposal nor a solicitation for offers.  All information received by close of business, 5/20/2004 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

TICTIC is a commercial-off-the shelf application that is used with CICS ASKTIME command.  The ASKTIME command is issued by an application program in order to get the current date and time, as supplied by the operating system.  Tic Toc is used to intercept these commands and return a virtual date and/or time.  The virtual date and/or time are used to set certain transactions, terminals, userids or combination of these.  SSA also uses Tic Toc as a date/time simulation testing tool. It is used on a job-by job basis to test the affects of various dates on SSA application programs without any code changes. A sole source award pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items shall be issued to the Isogon Corporation for these products. Interested vendors must submit detail information on their products to include technical literature and pricing data to the Contract Specialist via the US Postal Service or email at madeline.tims@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Government Printing Office, in coordination with Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA), intends to release a Request for Proposal for the development/deployment of a new Electronic Passport that contains an embedded Integrated Circuit (IC).. This initiative includes the integration and procurement of contactless integrated circuit technology into the traditional paper-based passport booklet document.  One of the primary driving forces that has led to this requirement is Section 303(c) of the Enhanced Border Security Act and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 which requires, inter alia, that countries that participate in the US Visa Waiver Program have a program to issue to its nationals machine readable passports that are tamper resistant and incorporate biometric and document authentication identifiers that comply with applicable biometric and document identifying standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Consistent with principles of international reciprocity, the United States intends to adhere to these same requirements. The use of contactless integrated circuit technology arises as a direct result of standards decisions taken by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), announcing on May 2003 that ICAO has selected high-capacity, contactless integrated circuit (IC) chips to store identification information in MRTDs -- passports, visas and identity cards. This decision and the related determinations made by ICAO regarding the use of biometrics for travel document applications are reflected in Document 9303, Part 1, the ICAO standards for passports. The Request for Proposal relates solely to the requirement for a chip in-lay assembly and for the contactless chip integration. The U.S. intends to integrate chip technology into passports in several phases of implementation. The first and  most urgent need is to begin issuance of  biometric-carrying electronic  passports at a single domestic passport issuance facility in late 2004, and then to transition to issuance of electronic passports at all remaining domestic issuance facilities by the end of 2005. In parallel, CA will work with the Department of Homeland Security to conduct field testing of the newly issued passports. The remaining phases of implementation will be carried out more broadly in terms of both issuance as well as inspection, with the ultimate goal of issuing all full validity, domestically issued US passports in the new electronic format. Product Specifications: In accordance with ICAO specifications and State Department requirements, the product sought shall be ISO/IEC 14443, Part 1-4 compliant, Type A or B, with a minimum storage capacity of 64 K (kilobytes) chip/antenna assembly embedded in an in-lay suitable for incorporation into the paper passport book; on-board operating system in accordance with ISO/IEC Standard 7816-4; the data will be stored on the chip in the Logical Data Structure prescribed by ICAO and secured with a digital signature. The ICAO has developed supplementary interoperability specifications covering a number of factors such as power levels, performance timings, read rate, buffer size and others.  Minimum read range to be at least 2cm. The memory must support random access data retrieval with a data retention capability of 15 years under the conditions of use described in ISO 7816 and will support 105 read/write cycles without failure or performance degradation. Most US passports are issued for a ten-year period of validity; thus, the passport and its embedded chip assembly must meet this requirement in terms of overall durability in normal use. Testing of offered inlays and passports with embedded inlays will be conducted.  Tests will include durability, flexing, susceptibility to solvents, electrical/magnetic fields, stamping, and the routine use to which  an international traveler is likely to subject the passport.   Additional information will be included in the RFP. The chip will store data regarding the authorized bearer of the passport. Specifically, the chip will store the same printed, personalization information  visible in the passport’s visual and machine readable zones such as name, issuance authority, date and place of birth etc. Additionally, to meet the ICAO requirement for a globally interoperable biometric, the chip will store at least one 12 K compressed full facial image of the authorized document bearer. Authenticity of data and protection of privacy are critical considerations. Similarly, facilitation of travel is a corollary objective along with enhanced border security. Therefore, the performance variables associated with transmission speeds and data transfer rates should be addressed clearly and comprehensively. The Electronic Passport must be electronically readable on a globally interoperable basis. Vendors should consider that incorporation of the IC into the document should be accomplished with as little impact on current book manufacturing and passport issuance operations as possible. There are three areas of operational consideration that together constitute the overall concept of operations for the U. S. passport production.  First, GPO will continue to manufacture the US passport at its location in Washington, DC.  It is intended that the chip assembly/inlay, embedded onto the passport cover material will be provided to GPO for incorporation into the passport book at GPO, with as little impact as possible on existing GPO book production processes.   The susceptibility of the assembly/inlay to temperature variables, flexing, bending, etc. are important features that will be addressed in testing by NIST.  Second, the Department of State will continue to personalize passports using its Toppan MP300US printers. The use of the chip and the incorporation of the inlay in the book must be compatible with this process to the extent possible and without any impact on the ability to print data into the passport. Finally, the inspection of documents, generally carried out at international ports of entry, is the third systemic area of concern. Inspection of U.S. passports will vary all over the world and passports will be subject to manual, machine-reading and possibly unattended examination. Electronic Passport readers will vary in many ways, although ICAO has recommended that ISO Standard 14443 both A and B capability be used. The inspection authorities will also likely be equipped to read the OCR-B as at present as well as reading of other document features facilitated by full-page readers. The chip assembly’s performance variables should be addressed in this inspection context. Pricing information will be required for both small quantities required in early stages of implementation as well as larger quantities that will be required for full nationwide implementation. The US currently issues approximately 8 million passports annually.  It is the intent of CA that all will be issued as electronic passports by 2006. Policy options under consideration related to the US passport could possibly increase annual passport issuance to the range of 12 million or higher. Potential bidders will be requested to include a schedule for delivery, milestones related thereto, dependencies or caveats in such scheduling, and manufacturing capacity/flexibility with regard to both small quantities early in implementation and higher quantities as volume reaches maximum. Bidders will also be asked to disclose any information regarding health and safety concerns with respect to the use of proposals (i.e. the use of adhesives to bind the offered cover material with embedded inlays to the passport book).  A draft RFP will be released on/or about 5/17/04.    A pre-proposal conference will be held on/or about 5/25/04.  It is anticipated that a walk-through of the Government Printing Office and a typical passport agency will be conducted on or about 5/27/04.  A maximum of two representatives from each prospective prime may attend these walk-throughs. Confirmation dates, times, and locations will be specified in the draft RFP. Issuance of a solicitation can be expected on/or about 6/11/04, with a response due on or about 7/12/04.  Contract award(s) will be made on or about 8/30/04. Offerors will be evaluated on technical merit and price.  Multiple awards may be considered. This will be a firm-fixed contract for materials with T&M rates for labor. Award is planned for one-year with four 1-year options. This procurement action will be unrestricted but only those companies with proven inlay design and fabrication experience will be considered. Buy American Act provisions apply to this procurement.  All prospective offerors should submit their questions to Albertha Broadnax, GPO Contracting Specialist; abroadnax@gpo.gov; or the Contracting Officer; Herbert H. Jackson, Jr.; hjackson@gpo.gov.  This synopsis does not constitute an RFP and does not obligate the Government in any way.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTICE - NON-MANDATORY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MEETING FOR INTERESTED BIDDERS:  All interested Bidders are invited to attend a non-mandatory meeting at the Richard Bolling Federal Building, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri, to be held at 5:30 pm on Tuesday, May 11, 2004.  The purpose of the meeting will be to allow Bidders to view inside of vertical return shafts and pipe shafts in locations that cannot be opened during regular working hours.  Representatives of Kingston Environmental Services, Inc. will conduct the viewing and answer questions.  Contractors are encouraged to supply their own flashlights and PPE as desired.  Hard hats will be required.

Interested Bidders will be required to pass through building security at 5:30 pm and assemble in Conference Room N-133 on the First Floor.  No building access will be permitted after 6:00 pm.


ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:  The project is a continuation of Phase I of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.  Approximately 80,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated cost range is $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.  Completion time is 196 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about July 19, 2004.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the bi-state Kansas City region consisting of the Kansas Counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri Counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray; (2) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (3) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 15 and 16 and various return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 15 and 16 will be vacant.  Base Bid contract work includes tenant improvements consisting of new drywall partitions; minor amounts of ceiling replacement; new doors, frames and hardware; paint, plaster, and vinyl base; casework; tenant signage; redistribution of existing above ceiling HVAC; new, and relocation of, existing lighting fixtures; floor box connections for office furniture; new panel boards; and telephone and data raceway and drops.  Base Bid also includes shell work consisting of patching and preparing concrete floor slab for finishes, demolition and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts at the 15th and 16th floors, installation and finishing of new shaft walls at the 15th and 16th floors, and installation of new transformers.  Option Bid work includes minor modifications in rest rooms and vending rooms; installation of epoxy terrazzo and base, vinyl wall covering and carpet; and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage 1 will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage 2 will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the prime contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications and price are approximately equal.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price most advantageous to the Government.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered - technical qualifications and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management Plan Approach.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  After all proposals have been ranked according to their technical quality, price proposals will be opened and separately ranked.  The two separate ranks will be averaged together into a single total rank and the offeror with the highest total rank will be considered the most advantageous.  If the ranks of two or more offerors are equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, completed drawings and specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  The drawings are being provided as .DWF file.  Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.  Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.   

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact, 
2.	Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.	Your Company’s Tax ID Number, 
4.	Your Telephone Number, and 
5.	Your E-Mail Address.

ATTACHMENT 1-

1.  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES.  Except as otherwise stated in this contract, the contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment,  tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform air transportation services for passenger movement as defined in this contract.  The transportation of passengers shall be in compliance with D0D Commercial Air Carrier Quality and Safety Requirements as described in 32 CFR Part 861.3.

1.1  SPECIFIC TASKS

1.1.1.  Regular Schedule.  The contractor shall provide air transportation services utilizing aircraft that are IFR equipped, multi-engine, and turbine powered.  Contractor base of operations shall be located at NAS Pt Mugu CA.  The primary purpose of the contract is to shuttle passengers between NAS Pt Mugu CA and San Nicolas Island CA five days a week. (See subparagraph 1.1.2.)  Additional passenger missions between these locations may be required during the week, weekends and holidays as well as to other off-line locations within a 500 nautical mile radius of Pt Mugu CA.  (See subparagraph below entitled “Off-Line Missions”).

1.1.2.  The contractor shall transport a minimum of 130 passengers and baggage in aircraft with capability of meeting mission requirements with no more than five (5) outbound/inbound missions from Point Mugu/San Nicolas Island CA.  At least 130 passengers (32,500 pounds) must be transported to San Nicolas Island CA by 0930 with the first departure from Point Mugu CA at 0700.  NOTE:  If more than one aircraft is used, departure times will be staggered at each location in 15 minute intervals, i.e., 0700, 0715, 0730, etc.  Route pattern “HOTEL” (61 NM) is the most commonly used Navy directed flight plan.  The daily flight schedules are as follows:

Monday (or first working day of the week) – Transport a minimum of 130 passengers from Pt Mugu to San Nicolas Island within 2.5 hours of the initial scheduled departure time of 0700.  Transport a minimum of 60 passengers from San Nicolas Island to Pt Mugu from 1500 to 1730.

Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of First Week and Tuesday and Wednesday of Second Week.  Transport a minimum of 60 passengers from Pt Mugu to San Nicolas Island from 0700 to 0930 and transport a minimum of 60 passengers from San Nicolas Island to Pt Mugu from 1500 to 1730.

Friday of First Week and Thursday of Second Week  – Transport a minimum of 60 passengers from Pt Mugu to San Nicolas Island from 0700 to 0930 and transport a minimum of 130 passengers from San Nicolas Island to Pt Mugu within 2.5 hours of the initial scheduled departure time of 1500 to 1730.

Changes to Regular Schedule  During periods of inclement weather, the regular scheduled flights may be delayed, but the passenger airlift requirement must still be met as soon as practical.  Flight schedules to San Nicolas Island are subject to change during federal holidays and the holiday seasons.  These changes will be made to match passenger load requirements and airfield hours.  The contractor will be given ample notice of changes to the regular schedule.

After Hours Additional Flights:  In addition to the regular schedule, there will be add-ons to the schedule to meet test requirements.  Some test operations will require week-end, evening (after 1730), and/or holiday back-up dates for completion.  For example. A test operation may be scheduled for Friday with back-ups scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.  If the test operation is not performed on Friday, the contractor will be required to fly on the weekend to transport passengers between Point Mugu and San Nicolas Island.

1.1.3.  Off-Line Missions  The contractor shall provide airlift service for extra mission requirements between Point Mugu and a 500 mile radius from 0930 to 1500 Monday through Friday.  These off-line missions may be flown Monday through Friday from 0700 to 0930 and 1500 to 1730 only if lighter than normal daily passenger loads permit use of contractor aircraft.

Notification of Changes and Additional Requirements:  The government will give the contractor 14 hours advance notice for additional week-day requirements and twenty-four advance notice for weekend and holiday requirements.  The contractor does not have to accept missions requested inside the 14 or 24 hour advance notice period.  Additional missions will be scheduled so as not to exceed normal crew duty days.

<DESC>NOTICE OF AMENDMENT TO PRIOR POSTING (RFI-2004-SR-00003)DATED 3/30/2004.  THE DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF INFORMATION AND DATA/PRODUCT SAMPLES IS HEREBY EXTENDED TO 6/1/04.  THE DUE DATE FOR INTERESTED VENDORS TO MAKE PRESENTATIONS IS EXTENDED TO THE WEEK OF JUNE 14, 2004.     The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is seeking to sign a Letter of Agreement (LOA) to work with an aerial lift manufacturer to conduct applied research on aerial lift safety. The goal of this project is to improve the safety of aerial lift operators and ground personnel by conducting applied research on the mechanisms of fall/collapse/tipover incidents related to this equipment while in operation.  This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner selected will share in the research and engineering findings with NIOSH researchers 

Between 1992-99, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics identified 341 deaths in construction related to the use of personnel lifts. An investigation of occupational aerial lift fatalities (McCann, 2003) showed that aerial lift operators are at risk of falls from elevation from tip-over events and from other failure modes related to the operation of this equipment. Tipovers of scissor lifts involved 30% of vertical lift deaths, mostly while the lifts were elevated at least 15 feet; hitting a hole or driving over the edge of elevation changes accounted for one-quarter of tipovers.

The project is currently in the study protocol phase.  NIOSH has conducted a surveillance study of fatal and nonfatal injuries related to the operation of aerial lifts, and is about to move into a second phase of the study, which will focus on engineering analysis of various factors such as the center of mass and loading conditions of aerial lifts, and the design of safety features that will affect operator safety. Prior to finalization of the research protocol, NIOSH wishes to solicit input from industry partners on the overall focus and direction of the research, so as to incorporate expert counsel from manufacturers of this equipment, as to the leading causes of injury-producing events, and most effective safety controls that can be incorporated into equipment design. 

Candidate companies which appear to possess the greatest capacity to meet the requirements listed below, will be evaluated based on their capability to successfully perform the following tasks: Perform engineering analysis of aerial lift components and systems, as well as perform modeling, simulation, design and associated research and engineering tasks needed to assess and modify design and operational characteristics of aerial lift equipment. This announcement does not obligate NIOSH to sign an LOA with any presented company.  NIOSH reserves the right to establish a partnership based on engineering analysis/evaluation capabilities found under this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the government. 

Collaborative Capabilities Parameters: (Companies should try to meet as many of these requirements as possible, but highly innovative solutions without testing are not discouraged from presentation or response.) 

(A) Providing significant engineering and technical expertise in manufacturing aerial lift equipment or safety control equipment for aerial lifts.   - Required; 

(B) Fabricating prototypes incorporating enhanced safety features or safety control equipment for test and evaluation - Required; 

(C) Providing expertise to NIOSH in designing and conducting field evaluations  - Required; 

(D) Reviewing test results and recommending design modifications; 

(E) Reviewing testing methods and recommending appropriate, new testing criteria. 

NIOSH is seeking an innovative partner to address these safety issues.  A company that is qualified and currently manufacturing or fabricating aerial lifts or safety control devices for aerial lifts is highly desired.  However, past testing and design of similar equipment is not required.  If prior testing has been performed the test information and results should be provided.  Interested parties responding to this request should provide detailed information regarding capabilities, test results, and cost data.  Presentation material may consist of literature, electronic presentation, or video. (Samples and data provided to the government as part of this solicitation will not be returned to vendors following the completion of this project.)  Vendors may be offered the opportunity to meet with representatives of the project team following a review of all submitted data. Data and/or product samples must be delivered to NIOSH by May 7, 2004  Although every effort will be made to consider all information received, the government will not be obligated to evaluate information received after May 7, 2004.  Vendors should note any proprietary data as such. If any data is to be excluded from exchange with any of the project participants, a statement of that fact shall be included with the statement of propriety.  Presentations from interested vendors are optional but encouraged. The government has identified  May 26 & 27, 2004, for these presentations to be conducted.  The Government reserves the right to identify an alternate meeting date if those identified are not viable for one or more interested vendors.  Please send literature to: Christopher Pan, Project Officer, CDC/NIOSH, MS/G800 1095 Willowdale Road Morgantown, WV 26505 Phone: 304-285-5978 Fax : 304-285-6047 syp4@cdc.gov (Please include 3 copies)

7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/CENTRAL ASIA, Almaty, Kazakhstan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

Objective

To serve as U.S. Personal Service Contractor (USPSC) in the capacity of the Director of Program Support Office for the USAID Mission to the Central Asian Republics, Almaty, Kazakhstan.

A)	Background

The Regional USAID Mission for the Central Asian Republics (USAID/CAR), located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, is responsible for the development and management of the USG regional assistance program directed at improving livelihoods through support to economic, democratic, social sector and natural resources reform and development in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

The Program Support Office provides programmatic support to the USAID/CAR Mission.  The office’s principal functions include: (a) oversight of program approval process; (b) monitoring/ evaluation of program performance and analyses of program strategic relevance and direction; (c) management of program budget; (d) management of information services; (e) oversight and final preparation of Mission reporting requirements, principally the annual report; (f) preparation and dissemination of public information material; and (g) management of the participant training program and the Eurasia Foundation grant..

The FY04 program budget is approximately $107 million, with a carryover FY03 budget of approximately $25 million.  The USAID/Central Asia Republic Mission is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Dushanbe, Tajikistan and Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.  The technical programs in the Mission focus on energy/water; health; enterprise development; democracy/conflict mitigation and basic education.

There is strong Washington interest in the program, including close scrutiny by Congress as well as by the State Department.  Funding for the program is authorized through the Freedom Support Act.  The State Department is responsible for implementation of the act, and USAID programming is done in very close coordination with the embassies in each of the countries and the State Department’s coordinator’s office in Washington, D.C., which has oversight responsibility for implementation of the Freedom Support Act.

The Program Support Office is responsible for management and/or oversight of Strategic Objective 4.2 (the cross-cutting SO), which includes one contract (participant training), two cooperative agreements (Arizona-Kazakhstan Partnership and Eurasia Foundation), carryover budgeting for basic education and conflict prevention and funding for program development and support.

B) Major Duties and Responsibilities

The USPSC Program Officer, reporting to the Deputy Mission Director, is a senior Mission position responsible for all aspects of programming oversight, including the program budget and strategic planning related to the Mission program.  He/she is a member of the Mission senior staff and has the following major responsibilities:

1. Utilizes high level expertise in interpreting Mission program strategy to advise senior Mission management, including the four principal country officers in the Central Asian countries, on all matters pertaining to Mission wide program direction and strategy, providing analytical and conceptualization leadership for all five country programs managed by the Regional Mission for Central Asia. Also, provide high level knowledge to support the development and management of monitoring, information and evaluation systems to track and report and impact of USAID activities in Central Asia.

2. Ensures continuous, high quality planning and development of technical and program resources to accomplish essential USAID objectives. Directs and coordinates all activities related to the planning, budgeting and strategy development process for the five bilateral assistance programs, including preparation and revision of Congressional Presentations, strategic plans, program impact assessments, evaluations, and other documents, as required.  Creativity in development of appropriate and comprehensive impact reporting is required.

3. Directs and manages Mission wide semi-annual review process and annual reporting.  Provides expert analyses of strategic issues and changes arising from reviews and reporting.  Serves as primary liaison with the USAID/Washington office of the Europe and Eurasia Bureau for all programmatic matters.

4. Ensures high level expertise in critical programmatic and budget support services to Mission technical offices, principally in the areas of program/activity approval, ADS (USAID’s Automatic Directive System) and program budget support.

5. Supervises Mission wide reporting and publicity on USAID programs, both within Central Asia, and to wider audience in Washington.  Reporting incorporates activity reporting, budget reporting, impact reports, as well as public information/press reporting. 

6. Represents USAID as required, and briefs senior officials of bilateral and multilateral donors, private individuals and others as needed on USG economic assistance programs, policies, objectives and development priorities, thus ensuring coordination and achievement of maximum development impact with USAID resources.

7. Works closely with the U.S. Embassy/Kazakhstan for input into the Embassy’s Mission Performance Plan, annual reporting requirements under the Freedom Support Act and USAID budgetary requirements.  Provides high quality support service to the other four country offices for similar Embassy requirements.

8. Provides expertise and overall direction for the participant training program, PD&S funds and the development of Global Development Alliance activities.  Assures Mission oversight of the USAID/W funded Eurasia Foundation.

9. Utilizes expert knowledge to address Program Support Office staff development to improve capacity to work more effectively with technical and country offices and increased value added functions.

10. Other duties as assigned, including, but not limited to, providing coverage in the event of absence of either the project development officer or the FSN budget specialist, or both, and providing, if required, office coverage of one or more of the country officers (Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan)

C) Supervision and Relationships

The USPSC Program Officer is supervised by the Deputy Mission Director.  The USPSC Program Officer supervises the following program support office staff:
	1 US Resident PSC Information Specialist – GS-12
	1 FSN Program Budget Specialist – FSN-11
	1 FSN Administrative Assistant – FSN-7
Two FSN Project Management Specialists (FSN-12 and FSN-10) are supervised by the USDH Project Development Officer, but the Program Officer, in corroboration with the Project Development Officer, provides overall direction and leadership for their functions.

As a USPSC the Program Officer cannot directly supervise the USDH Project Development Officer, but the Program Officer will be expected to provide technical direction to the Project Development Officer, and input to the Deputy Mission Director for preparation of the Project Development Officer’s annual evaluation.                                      

Direct supervision of the one contractor and two cooperative agreements rests with the FSN-12 Project Management Specialist.  However, the USPSC Program Officer will provide appropriate technical direction and leadership

D) Other Factors

A high degree of tact, firmness, and creativity is required at all times.  Interpersonal skills are also at a premium, given the large number of people both within and outside the US Mission with which the Program Support Office must engage.  Mission technical offices operate with a high degree of autonomy and program support functions must be adaptive to a value-added approach.

E) Required Qualifications

10 or more years as a USAID program officer is required.  Persons having served in FE-OC positions and demonstrating program management skills are encouraged to apply.  Supervisory management experience is preferred.  Specific experience in working with USAID program budget management, monitoring/evaluation, performance management plans and strategy development is highly desirable.

<SOLNBR>W15QKN-04-X-0240
<RESPDATE>060104
<CONTACT>CAROL YANAVOK, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3365
<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal,  New Jersey is conducting a market survey to identify sources that are capable  of supplying Mounts (bipods) and Baseplates for U.S. 120mm Mortar Systems.   This survey is intended to identify sources for two distinct efforts: 1)  Manufacture and deliver Mounts (bipods) and Baseplates in accordance with the  Government Technical Data Package (TDP); and 2) Manufacture and deliver  Lightweight Mounts (bipods) and Baseplates in accordance with a contractor TDP  and Government technical/performance requirements.   Effort 1.   The contractor shall manufacture and deliver Mounts (bipods) and  Baseplates in accordance with the Government TDP.  The Technical Data Package  (TDP) for the M120/M121 will be provided under contract and contains the  minimum basic configuration requirements.  The required production quantity of  each component will be approximately 90 each with options for additional  quantities.  The supplier will provide all resources and materials to produce  the required items.  Component and system design may incorporate product  improvements over current U.S. M120/M121 weapon systems and shall have the  potential for adaptation to emerging lightweight technologies. Deliverable  items shall be produced from high-grade materials using state of the art  manufacturing processes, yielding quality workmanship (free of defects), and in  strict accordance with an ISO 9001-2000 compliant quality management system.   Two each (2) components/systems must be available no later than three (3)  months after award of the contract for qualification test and evaluation  (T&E).  Two each (2) additional systems must be available no later than five  (5) months after contract award for First Article Acceptance Test (FAAT).   Pending results of qualification T&E and FAAT, delivery of production items  shall commence no later than 2 months after First Article approval.    Effort 2.   The contractor shall manufacture and deliver Lightweight Mounts  (bipods) and Baseplates in accordance with a contractor TDP and Government  technical/performance requirements.  Lightweight robust designs requiring  minimum qualification and tests are key objectives.   Lightweight candidate sub- systems (mounts and baseplates) shall be 30-40% lighter (threshold) than  current M120/M121 sub-system weights.  The complete technical data package for  new and lightweight designs shall be a deliverable item under pending  contract.   Quantities and schedules TBD. The 120mm Mortar System lightweight  components must meet the minimum requirements described herein.  The  components’ and system design shall be mature (fully developed, qualified,  safety certified), of high quality (designed to meet or exceed customer  performance requirements), optimized for manufacture, readily producible for  immediate fielding, and require minimal test and qualification.  Design  optimization shall facilitate ease of manufacture, efficient production  processes, and ensure maximum durability and field life of weapon system items. - The components shall be functionally compatible with existing U.S. 120mm M120  and M121 Mortar Systems equipment (i.e. New baseplates shall be usable with the  existing U.S. M120 120mm mortar cannons and mounts.   New mortar mounts shall  be usable with existing U.S. M120/M121 120mm cannons, baseplates and the M1064  Mortar Carrier).  The new Baseplates and Mortar Mounts shall be transportable  on the M1064 and Stryker mortar carriers using the current baseplate and mortar  mount stowage provisions on both mortar carriers.  The components shall be  capable of operating and being stored in environmental extremes (hot and basic)  as prescribed in AR 70-38.  The components’ materials shall be stable  construction to resist corrosion due to fuels, salt spray, or atmospheric  conditions likely to be met in storage or normal use.  - The mortar baseplates and mounts shall support the smooth bore U.S. 120mm  mortar cannon during ground firing of the full suite of U.S. M900 series mortar  ammunition under all surface and sub-surface conditions including sand, mud,  and hard surface (macadam or concrete).   The mortar baseplates and mounts  shall be sufficiently robust to support the mortar cannon during the full range  of mortar ammunition fire at weapon elevations 45 degrees to 85 degrees, at  charges 0 (approximately 1,700 psi) thru charge 4 (approximately 11,600 psi),   and proof firing of mortar system at 19,000 +/- 500 psi.   Lightweight  candidate sub-systems (mounts and baseplates) shall be 30-40% lighter  (threshold) than current M120/M121 sub-system weights (70 lbs/78 lbs mounts and  136 lbs baseplates) and retain the full functioning capability of the current  M120/M121 design. - The 120mm Mortar Mount shall provide the cannon cross leveling, elevation and  traversing adjustments for required accuracy of U.S. M900 series mortar  ammunition during ground and carrier firing.  The design of the cross leveling,  elevation and traversing adjustments shall incorporate smooth gearing  mechanisms to enable uninterrupted traverse through at least 150 mils, to  enable a mortar emplacement time of no more than 2 minutes and to minimize time  required to adjust fire after firing a mortar round.  The gears and gearing  mechanisms shall be precision made and sealed to protect against fouling from  dirt and sand.  The cross leveling, elevation and traversing adjustments shall  operate in the same basic manner and direction as the U.S. 60mm and 81mm mortar  systems.   The mount shall provide an interface for the M67 Sight Unit to  enable the gunner, without the need to move his head from the M67 Sight, to lay  the mortar in any aforementioned elevation and deflection.  The mount shall  incorporate heavy duty high strength components and a robust buffer system for  maximum shock absorption to retain the mortar in battery (during and after  firing) and shall prevent related performance failure to the mount sub  components and to the M67 Sight Unit during mortar fire.    The total weight  for a lightweight candidate M120 mount is 42 – 49 lbs (threshold).  The total  weight for a lightweight candidate M121 mount is 46 – 54 lbs (threshold).  The  mount durability shall be a minimum of 10,000 charge 4 rounds. - The 120mm Mortar Baseplate shall provide a stable base for firing the mortar  system from the ground and shall be capable of withstanding the mortar recoil  loads at all charges and under all surface and sub-surface conditions.  The  breech ball interface socket shall permit firing in all directions (360  degrees) without moving the baseplate.  The weight for a lightweight candidate  baseplate is 81 – 95 lbs. (threshold).  The baseplate durability shall be a  minimum of 3,000 rounds.  Material Certifications and Government Source  Inspections will be required as part of the contemplating contract, which will  be on a firm fixed price basis.  The Government will utilize the information  provided from responses to this market survey for planning purposes only and  shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the  part of the Government.  All information submitted will be held in a  confidential status.  Interested firms with the capability of supplying 120mm  Mortar System Components as described herein should provide, at no cost to the  Government, a summary of their firm’s capabilities (Effort 1, Effort 2, or  both), including a description of their facilities, personnel, size business  (whether Large or Small), the ability to meet the aforementioned production  delivery schedule (Effort 1), and past experience within fifteen days of this  publication by electronic mail to cyanavok@pica.army.mil or call 973-724- 3365.

<SUBJECT>The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) intends to establish a qualification requirement for the manufacture and refurbishment of SSBN 726 Class Main Shaft Seal per the provisions of FAR 9.2.
<DESC>The Main Shaft Seals are critical in maintaining the watertight integrity of the submarine in all operating conditions.  These seals are difficult to manufacture and/or refurbish, with extremely critical tolerances and flatness requirements.  When the NAVICP procures the manufacture and refurbishment SSBN 726 Class Main Shaft Seal, only sources that have been approved under the qualification requirements will be considered for contract award.  Contractors interested in manufacturing and refurbishing SSBN 726 Class Main Shaft Seals may request a copy of the specification and drawing package and the technical data package from the Contract Specialist at NAVICP: Naval Inventory Control Point  Code 0243.23 5450 Carlisle Pike Mechanicsburg, PA 17055 (717)605-7821 email Kevin.Kauffman@Navy.mil The item is the Main Shaft Seal, National Stock Number (NSN) 7H2825-01-391-9808 an d is manufactured to the following: NAVSHIPS Drawing No. 203-5770269 Rev B  Engineering Notice EN DM105188 Rev F NAVSHIPS Drawing No. 203-5770270 Rev C NAVSHIPS Drawing No. 203-5770271 Rev C EB SPEC2842E EB SPEC 2856D Due to the military critical technology contained in the specifications and drawings, a completed and approved DD Form 2345, entitled Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, must accompany  the contractor’s request for documents.  Certification under the JCP establishes the eligibility of a U.S. or Canadian contractor to receive technical data governed, in the U.S. by DoD Directive 5230.25 and, in Canada, by the Technical Data Control Regulations (TDCR).  The Defense Logistics Information Service at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/ijcp/ is responsible for the administration and functionality of the Certification process.  Once a contractor has been provided wit h a copy of the specification and drawing package, all further actions regarding the qualification process will be between the contractor and Department of the Navy,  Naval Seal Systems Command  Attn:  Code 05Z22, Mr Quoc Nguyen  1333 Isaac Hull Avenue S.E. Stop 5214  Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-5214.   Any qualification for manufacture of SSBN 726 Class Main Shaft Seal will be done by the contractor and will not be accomplished under a Navy contract.  The approximate time period following submission of a paper product for qualification testing within which the applicant will be notified whether the product passed or failed the qualification testing is currently estimated to be 45 days.  The approximate time period following submission of a hardware product for qualification testing within which the applicant will be notified whether the product passed or failed the q ualification testing is currently estimated to be 30 days.  When a product is submitted for qualification testing, the applicant must furnish any specific information that may be requested of the manufacturer before testing will begin.  This information is specified in the technical data package and includes the contractor’s proposed certification/testing plan and the contractor’s repair and manufacturing process and procedures.  Once a contractor becomes qualified, the Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command, Code 05Z22 will notify NAVICP.  At that point, the newly qualified firm will be included on the mailing list of any SSBN 726 Class Main Shaft Seal solicitations and will be considered for possible contract award.  It is anticipated that the NAVICP will begin making awards to these qualification requirements starting in May, 2004.

<DESC>Ethnographic Study of the CACO Dune Shacks Contractor to furnishing all labor, equipment, supplies,  materials and travel expenses, as well as the necessary qualified personnel, facilities, and support  to provide a technical report that fully documents the historical and traditional cultural significance of the Dune Shacks of the Peaked Hill Bars Historic District to the dwellers of these shacks within the Cape Cod National Seashore (a unit of the National Park Service).  Using the results of the documentation research, the scope of work requires a determination of eligibility (DOE) for inclusion of the dune shack historic district in the National Register based on traditional cultural significance.  A site visit and fieldwork involving ethnographic interviews and the collection of oral history will be carried out and it is expected that fieldwork will take place during the summer of 2004.  The documentation report will describe the traditional cultural significance of the Dune Shacks Historic District and, using this information, will evaluate the eligibility of the historic district as a 'traditional cultural property' and of the dune community as a 'traditionally associated people.'  Although the district has documented historical significance based on its association with artists and writers from the first half of this century, and its landscape and unusual architecture, there is a lack of information about the dune dwellers and the dune 'way of life' which is independent of the artistic tradition and that created and maintained the district to the present time.  The ethnographic information and analysis will augment existing knowledge about the historic significance of the district and will be used by park management for the development of effective management procedures for the protection and preservation of the historic district.    Proposals will be evaluated on the following criteria in descending order of importance:  Technical Approach  1.  Adequacy of methodologies proposed for data collection and analysis (30 points);  2.  Project Schedule, including allocation of time among different research tasks and project activities (10 points); Staffing Plan:  1.  Appropriateness of professional experience and academic specialty of Principal  Investigator and other personnel; and adequacy of mix of staff expertise, if any(20 points);  2.  Demonstrated experience completing technical reports and professional publications in a timely manner (10 points); 3.  Experience applying techniques of data collection and analysis responding to regulatory issues related to management of cultural or natural resources (10 points); Detailed Cost Proposal:1.  Adequacy of cost elements to achieve stated study objectives  (20 points) This is a two-phase project.   Phase I work will be the basis for award.  Phase II work is considered an option, and may be elected at time of award, pending the availability of funding.  If funding does not permit election of the option at time of award, this option may be elected at a later date, pending the availability of funding.   INSTRUCTIONS TO INTERESTED PARTIES: Proposals will be accepted for the next 15 days from date of issuance.  Any proposals submitted after the date and time for receipt will be handled in accordance with FAR 15.208 Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.    E-mail responses are preferred and should include the Subject: Cape Cod Dune Shack Ethno project.  Cost proposals/spreadsheets shall be separate from Technical proposal and submitted in MS Word/Excel Format and include total columns.   Proposals shall include supporting documentation and narratives that explain all cost proposed, projections or, estimates.    Award will be made on a "Best Value" basis and in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria listed above which are weighted according to their importance.    A Best Value is defined as the offer that results in the most advantageous acquisition decision for the Government. Evaluation of offers will be made by the National Park Service, Northeast Regional Office.  All questions must be forwarded in writing to:     Ellen_Barr@nps.gov, please reference A4506040200 and NAICS CODE 541990 .

CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR)
Effective October 1, 2003, all vendors that do business with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Federal Government must be registered in CCR.  Contractors are strongly encouraged to register with CCR now to avoid payment delays.  

Changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) require, among other things, that contractors be registered in the CCR before award of any contract, basic agreement, blanket purchase agreements, or basic ordering agreement can be made, and that contract payments and/or new awards will be conditioned on CCR registration.  The FAR change will also require that contractors with existing contracts that require performance after September 30, 2003, register in the CCR.  There are 5 exceptions to the CCR registration requirement, including purchases that use the government-wide purchase cards as the purchasing mechanism, certain emergency operations and urgent procurements, certain purchases where CCR registration could jeopardize national security, and awards to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States. 

The preferred method for completing a registration is via the World Wide Web at http://www.ccr.gov.  There, a CCR Handbook is available to provide detailed information on data you will need prior to beginning the on-line registration, as well as steps to walk you through the registration process.  You must have a DUNS number in order to begin your registration.  If you do not already have a DUNS number, please call Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., at 1-866-705-5711 or  610-882-7000. There is no cost to obtain a DUNS number.

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE HEREBY PROVIDED TO ALL QUOTERS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND DO NOT BECOME PART OF THE SOLICITATION:

PART ONE

1. On the Desktop System: On Page 2:  The Case Dimensions are Unclear: The requirement states Case Dimensions - 18" x 6 7/8"H x 18 3/8Dx 7W. Could you please specify the dimensions, they are unclear.  Are Dimensions of 17.5"(H) x 7"(W) x 19"(D) acceptable?

THE SOLICITATION IS CLEAR ON ITS FACE

2. On the Laptop Computer:  a) Processor Pentium 4-m 2.4GHz.  This processor is being discontinued by Intel according to Intel's website in December of this year, which will make this processor obsolete and cause potential replacement/supply problems.  Would the Navy accept another processor that has equal benchmark performance standards, if such performance can be verified?
 
THE SOLICITATION IS CLEAR ON ITS FACE

3. The Navy is requesting am internal, swappable, removable 250MB Zip Drive.  If we are providing the required 3.5" Floppy Swappable Internal Drive and CD/DVD Internal Swappable Drive to meet your requirements, can we propose an external USB 250MB Zip Drive, since all of our suppliers that have the Floppy/CD-DVD Dual Drive requirement met, do not offer the Internal Swappable 250MB Zip Drive.

THE SOLICITATION IS CLEAR ON ITS FACE

4. We are unclear as to the submission of the Bid in response to this requirement.  Are you requesting we provide (1) desktop and (1) laptop with our proposal submission, or are you requiring them (the Desktop and Laptop) 2 weeks after the closing date of the Solicitation?  The delivery requirement on the unit requested for technical review seem unclear, please clarify.

SEE PART 2
 
5.  Is this requirement Full and Open competition or are there Set-Aside provisions (Small, Disadvantaged, Disabled Veteran, 8A Businesses) that will be part of the evaluation and selection of the awardee?

THE SOLICITATION IS CLEAR ON ITS FACE

6. In the solicitation it says that they have to be Pentium 4 3.06 cpu;s with an 800mhz Front side bus and ddr 400 memory, that’s impossible, the P4 3.06 is a 533 front side bus processor and uses ddr 333. You have to fix it to say a Pentium 4 3.0 or 3.2 with a 800 mhz Front Side Bus. 

SEE PART 2

7. These units are to be dropped shipped or will they need to be installed and setup?

THE SOLICITATION IS CLEAR ON ITS FACE

8. Was curious if there were any specific systems that these were modeled after, such as dells or gateways and if so what are the model numbers?

THE SOLICITATION IS CLEAR ON ITS FACE
9. Regarding the subject solicitation, are you seeking one source for both items (desktops and notebooks) on this bid.  Or, would it be acceptable for my company to bid solely on the notebooks?
THE SOLICITATION IS CLEAR ON ITS FACE

10. Included in the specifications for the desktop configuration are the dimensions of the CPU case, which read 18" X 6-7/8"H X 18-3/8"D X 7"W.  Will you please clarify the height dimension (18" X 6-7/8"H)? 

THE SOLICITATION IS CLEAR ON ITS FACE

11.  Additionally, what exactly is meant by "CONUS" and "OCONUS" support?

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR OFFICE CHAIRS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to extend the due date and answer questions.  The chairs will be used in the Mission Evaluation Room of the Mission Control Center onsite at NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.  This is an environment where multiple shifts use the same equipment.  For this reason, durability and adjustability are priorities. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to May 13, 2004. The following questions and answers are provided below:   Question #1:   Please clarify the following so that we may provide an accurate quote: a)Back support option:	(N2) no additional support or (AJ) adjustable lumbar support? b)Base finish: (G1) graphite; (XT) titanium with smoke frame; (CD) polished aluminum with graphite frame? c)Casters: (BB) 2 ½” black casters for carpet; (C&) 2 ½” black casters for hard floor? d)Seating Material:  Price category #1, #2, or #4E? e)Armpad Fabric:  Grade 1, 2, 3, 4, etc?

<DESC>This is Amendment 0004 to combined synopsis/solicitation W58RGZ-04-R-0547 for the purpose of revising the requirement for the Aerial Surveillance Platform.  Industry has questioned the exclusion of air conditioning in the aerial surveillance platform  on numerous occasions.  The specific questions and answers are found in Amendment 0001, Q & A 6 and Amendment 0003, Q & A 2.  This requirement has changed.  Paragraph 3.0.1 AIRCRAFT CHARACTERISTICS	is hereby revised to add the requirement for air conditio ning.  In Amendment 0002, question 22, an industry representative questioned what secure equipment the coms package would have to interface with.  The answer provided was incomplete.  The government does not have specific equipment interface identified.  T herefore, the requirement stated at paragraph 3.0.4(2) is deleted from this requirement.  The evaluation criteria for the training plan element was inadvertently omitted from the original combined synopsis/solicitation and is provided as follows: In the Tr aining Plan Element, the Maintenance Training factor and the Pilot Training factor are equal in importance.  The offerors maintenance training approach will be evaluated based on completeness and adequacy of the approach to the extent that it represents a thorough understanding of the requirement.  The offerors approach regarding training materials, manuals, media, training assets, course content and instructor proficiency will be evaluated.  The offerors pilot training approach will be evaluated based on c ompleteness and adequacy of the approach to the extent that it represents a thorough understanding of the requirement.  The offerors approach regarding training materials, flight manuals, media, student workbooks, training assets, course content and instru ctor proficiency will be evaluated.  The evaluator will consider the procedures, skills, facilities and course content the offeror proposes to use to perform the aircraft maintenance and pilot training for adequacy and relative effectiveness.  It is furthe r clarified that the training plan, logistics support package and airworthiness are equal in importance.  The proposal due date is hereby extended to 21 May 2004, 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST).  Changes to the requirement should be annotated in pen  and ink to the original synopsis/solicitation. Solicitation W58RGZ-04-R-0547 will not be reposted in its entirety.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0005 to combined synopsis/solicitation W58RGZ-04-R-0547 for the purpose of revising the requirement for the Aerial Surveillance Platform.  Three additional questions from industry have been received, one of which results in a change  to the specifications set forth in paragraph 3.0.5 of the solicitation, as amended.  Q1: With regard to the Gen 1 requirement; I have spoken to (company name) and to quote their VP of sales, there is not a Gen 1 system made that will meet the requirements  of para 3.0.3 of the solicitation.  Therefore, we are quoting a system that (company name) recommends which is a Gen 3 sensor.  The question then is, if awarded a contract, will the Government assist with the export licensing?  Or, will the delays caused by the export license requirement be allowed by the Government?  A1: A Generation I sensor is all that is required for this acquisition and as stated in Amendment 0002, question 18, no export license is required.  Should a proposal include a sensor other t han Generation I that requires an export license, it is the offerors responsibility to obtain the export license.  The proposed delivery schedule should include sufficient lead time for obtaining the license.   Q2: The IFF transponder requires a Kit 1C to give it the mode 4 IFF capability.  As we understand from our vendor, the Kit 1C is not available-rather is issued by the controlling USG agency.  Can we assume the Kit 1C will be issued by the government?  A2: An IFF transponder is not required; therefore , Kit 1C will not be required.  For clarification, the aircraft must be equipped with an operable coded radar beacon transponder having either Mode 3/A 4096 code capability, replying to Mode 3/A interrogations with the code specified by ATC, or a Mode S ca pability, replying to Mode 3/A interrogations with the code specified by ATC and intermode and Mode S interrogations in accordance with the applicable provisions specified in TSO C-112.  The aircraft must be equipped with automatic pressure altitude report ing equipment having a Mode C capability that automatically replies to Mode C interrogations by transmitting pressure altitude information in 100-foot increments.  The aircraft transponder must report Mode 1 requirements to ATC and Air Defense agencies.  Q 3: The HF specifications IAW para 3.0.4 require a frequency range of 1.5 to 30MHz.  We cannot find a vendor that supplies a radio with the frequency below 2.0, most say that below 2.0 is in the HAM range and is not used for airborne purposes.  Will the HF frequencies 2.0 to 30 be acceptable?  A3: No.  The required frequency range is 1.5 to 30 MHz.  The proposal due date is remains 21 May 2004, 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST).  Changes to the requirement should be annotated in pen and ink to the origin al synopsis/solicitation. Solicitation W58RGZ-04-R-0547 will not be reposted in its entirety.

<CONTACT>judith.bollenbacher, 256-876-5412
<DESC>The following technical question was submitted. The following government response is also provided. QUESTON Your requirement states that you are requesting the DVCS to have 8 channels scaleable to 32 (within a chassis) with an option for an additiona l 8 channels (Option 9). How many of your DVCS systems (5 total) require the Time recording  specified in the C.3.1.3 Data Recording Section. How many channels from each of those systems. LMS configures our Time Recording capabilities separately into a Dat a Reduction system which will increase recording performance, allow multiple time sessions per test, and record directly to the PC disk without the need for downloading it. The systems will work together as one (through status and COLA channels) and will g ive you the best performance.  As such, we have many ways to deliver this. 1. We could match every DVCS with its own Data Reduction system (double the channels and higher cost) 2. We could deliver 2 Data Reduction systems (8 ch) to be used with any DVCS (m ost flexibility and the channels can be put into 1 frame for larger tests) 3. We could deliver 1 Data Reduction system (16 ch) to be used with any DVCS (covers high channel needs, but only 1 frame to work with 1 DVCS at a time). RESPONSE The Options 9, 8 c hannel addition is an incremental upgrade from the base 8 channel system to the maximum of 32 channels. It is anticipated that a minimum of one DVCS will be equipped with 32 channels for multichannel data acquisition requirements. As indicated in paragraph  C.3.1.3, Statement of Work the DVCS requires the capability to independently perform the time waveform recording and associated control. Thus, the option 1 above (with 8 channel recording) will meet the base statement of work requirement. Identification o f the additional hardware cost is suggested to evaluate the proposal accurately. An alternate proposal may be submitted for evaluation, such as optional hardware for 8 channel time waveform recording with an incremental additional channel cost. This QUESTI ON and RESPONSE is also located at web site www.yuma.army.mil/contracting/rfp.html for review.
