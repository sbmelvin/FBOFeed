<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma contemplates the acquisition of two crane systems that will meet the specifications listed in Attachment 0001. The FAA's Enroute Support Program is responsible for transporting heavy antenna system equipment through the utilization of two semi-trailers.  The components stored in these trailers are required to be moved around both within the trailer and off-loaded.  The system will be used to load and unload components such as tools, equipment and antenna pedestal assets weighing up to 2000 pounds.  The majority of the Long Range Radar systems are located in remote areas in which standard material handling equipment such as forklifts are unavailable.  Currently, a chain hoist is installed in each trailer, however these hoists are underrated for the components now part of the Enroute Support Program's mission. The FAA is interested in locating a firm that is capable of providing the crane systems and is capable of the installation of systems, which will need to be permanently mounted inside two Government furnished semi-trailers.  The hoist systems must be capable of operating independently of an AC power source (i.e. run off the truck battery).  The crane systems will need to be mounted in two Government furnished 27-foot semi-trailers.   Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the solicitation process. Inquiries regarding this market survey should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Kelly Tillery, 405/954-7831

<DESC>The following is an outline of the acquisition procedures that the US Department of Transportation intends to use in preparation and execution of its DOT Solicitation No. DTOS59-08-R-00002 for the TELECOMMUNICATION OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE (O&M) SUPPORT SERVICES AND RELATED SUPPLIES ? 2008 ? 2013 ?TOM 8-13? acquisition.  The construct of this acquisition is considered due diligence in protecting sensitive information related to the DOT assets and infrastructure while providing adequate information and proposal opportunity for potential offerors.  The acquisition participation parameters outlined herein are provided for both information and comment purposes.  Additionally, potential offerors need to be cognizant of and strictly adhere to the pre-registration and attendance requirements applicable to pre-solicitation conference and the subsequent pre-proposal conference.

The TOM 8-13 acquisition is expected to result in two separate contract awards: one as a full and open competitive award focused on meeting the DOT?s ?core? telecommunications/PBX assets O&M support services within its headquarters campus and Washington metropolitan areas; and, a second small business set-aside award for ?non-core? telecommunication O&M support services such as infrastructure/closets management and connectivity, cabling, as well as moves, adds and changes.  Offers for the ?core? O&M support services award component of this acquisition may be submitted by any business type and/or size consistent with 2007 NAICS codes 517210, and 517919.  ?Core? offerors are also required to have an established Nortel certified relationship for award.  ?Non-core? offers will only be accepted from 8(a), Hub Zone and Service Disabled Veteran companies consistent with 2007 NAICS codes 517919 and 541618.  Offerors otherwise qualified are not precluded from proposing for both the ?core? and ?non-core awards.? It should be noted that any proposed teaming arrangement where an otherwise qualified small business teams with a large business, the Government fully intends to closely monitor post award work to assure that the small business actually performs more than 50% of the work.  And while the Government anticipates making two awards under this single TOM 8-13 acquisition, the Government also reserves the unilateral right to make only one award should that choice be determined as in the best interest of the Government.

TOM 8-13 awards will be for a base year and four one-year options to be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  Most if not all work will be performed as firm fixed price, fixed price contract line items, and/or task orders with fixed price time and materials labor and overhead.  Both ?core? and ?non-core? offers are expected to provide firm fixed price CLINs and fully loaded maximum labor rates and administrative handling rates applicable for time and materials or other support services task orders.  The ?core O&M support services award includes activities to begin with approximately a month transition period between the awardee and the current DOT telecommunications/PBX O&M provider, Verizon Federal.  There is no minimum guarantee associated with an award under the TOM 8-13 acquisition.

?Core? award and ?non-core? O&M support services award work, while generally separated according to the applicable SOW and not typically inter-mixed with respect to performance, are expected to sometimes interface and are required to be mutually supportive of Government?s requirements in such instances.  For further clarity, the Government?s expectation regarding potential cross over activities and cooperation is further described as follows:
-	At the discretion and prior approval of the cognizant Government Contracting Officer, the ?core? O&M support services provider may include fixed price contract line items, time and materials and task order elements of their contract that are ancillary to and/or directly applicable to other ?core? work being performed.  
-	The ?non-core? telecommunication O&M support services provider will generally be precluded from work typical of the ?core? O&M support services.  More specifically, the non-core O&M support services provider will not perform ?core? O&M support services without explicit written direction from the cognizant Government Contracting Officer and concurrent notification of the ?core? O&M support services provider regarding such direction.  
-	In all potential or actual work cross over situations, the cognizant Government Contracting Officer is the final decision point.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).   Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:  Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax:  (202) 475-3904.

<DESC>Attached is a Draft RFP for advanced planning, review and comments for the MOUT Training Systems.  Please note the planned pre-solication conference details in Section L of the RFP.  This Draft RFP contains a full set of CLINs desingated for East Coast installations; however, it only has a partial set for the West Coast and OCONUS.  For your review, consider the the East Coast CLINS to be duplicated in full for the West Coast and OCONUS.  The RFP attachemnt will be re-released as it's updated and completed. This effort is for a Worldwide Firm Fixed Price Requirements contract for the production, test, installation, and delivery of the USMC Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) Training Systems located at U. S. Marine Corps or other DOD Installations.  The contractor shall perform a mix of engineering analysis, design, fabrication, and installation of MOUT Training Systems. Extensive studies by the Marine Corps War Fighting Laboratory has shown that units trained to operate an integrated combined arms team are more successful within the urban battle space and suffer fewer casualties.  This training is required to ensure Marines are properly trained prior to deployment for real world operations in the Third World.  MOUT Training Systems are required in order for the Marine Corps to conduct quality and credible Advanced Urban Warfare Training.  MOUT Training Systems will primarily be used for company and battalion force-on-force and force-on-target maneuver training.   Non live fire training typically utilizes  Special Effects Small Arms Marking System (SESAMS) ammunition and/or Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) equipment.  Live fire training typically utilizes 5.56mm, 7.62mm, 9mm, and 50 caliber ballistics.  Individual MOUT Training Systems may be used exclusively for non-live fire training, live fire training, or a combination!   of both.   The MOUT Training System will provide a realistic environment to support a variety of training tasks related to the deployment and maneuver in an urban setting and enable Marines to conduct training in an environment replicating realist third world urban conditions.  The training system will provide a challenging and complex urban training environment replicating the difficulties Marine units will face as they communicate, coordinate, maintain situational awareness, navigate, execute, and track urban operations.  The MOUT Training System also allows Marine units to master the challenges of urban navigation, movement, target acquisition and engagement, and cross boundary coordination.  The MOUT Training System provides Marine units a full range of tactical challenges from humanitarian relief efforts to peacekeeping and law enforcement to direct combat that might be encountered in a complex urban setting within a relatively brief timeframe or a small physical area – known as t!  he “three block war”.   To accomplish the realistic third-world training mission, the MOUT Training System may be configured to include the following functional components:  Government, Industry, Education, Commercial, Medical, Religious, Public Areas (including Athletic Fields and Plazas).  Some of the components are live fire and non-live fire environments.  These components are comprised of non-permanent building structures constructed of various materials.  The structure, character, density, and features of each town, village, zone, or district reflect logical functions that are typical within that setting (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, recreation, religious, etc.). This annoucement is for advanced planning, review and comments and in no way implies either implicitly or explicitly that respondents will be compensated in any way by the US Government for information or materials provided. It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. All information provided becomes USMC property and will not be returned.

This sole-source solicitation is not meant to be used as a vehicle for the Army to procure an upgraded/updated replacement for the current legacy AN/APX100 Systems.  Replacement of the legacy Transponder Sets is a tri-service obje ctive that is being satisfied with the Army acquisition of the new RT-1836( C )/APX-118( C ) Transponder. The above version C RF Modules and A2 CCAs are sub-assemblies of the RT-16XX(V)/APX-100(V) Transponders.  There is currently no detailed Technical Data for the RT-1471A/APX-100(V) and RF Module sub-assemblies available from the Army.  The government does not possess adequate drawings and other final documentation for the RT-16XX/APX-100(V) Transponders and A2 CCAs. The Transponders shall be warranted to meet the following criteria: Form, fit and functionally interchangeable (down to the module/circuit card assembly), with Raytheons Part Numbers.  Meet requirements for DOD AIMS 97-1000 (DoD International AIMS Program Performance Standard, para. 4.1), DoD AIMS Program Office approval is required prior to procuring COTS/NDI to be used as replacement for an interface with existing AIMS systems. CECOM will not want to spend the time and money to AIMS qualify new Transponder sets or incur any  additional cost due to new/additional provisioning, logistics and maintenance support for a different AN/APX-100 configuration. Production Lead Time of 6-9 months is required for Transponders and 6 months for RF Modules.   Meet the requirements of MIL-R-81876B The RF Modules and A2 CCAs shall be warranted  to be form, fit and functionally interchangeable with Raytheons Part Numbers. When the RF modules and A2 CCAs are assembled in the RT-16XX(V)/APX-100(V) Transponders, the Transponders shall meet all the above  Transponder criteria. The current commercial source for Transponders, RF Modules and A2CCAs that meet all the above criteria is Raytheon Systems Company.  Detailed Technical Data and updated/current drawings are not available from the Army.   In addition this market survey is to locate additional commercial sources for Depot Repair Support Services for the AN/APX-100 Transponder System.  This will be an effort involving total and complete depot repair down to the piece part level and the contra ctor will have to overcome problems relating to repair parts obsolescence when problems of this nature arise.  This effort shall also include procurement of repair material and retrofitting of RT-12XX/APX-100(V) and RT-15XX/APX-100(V) units into RT-16XX/AP X-100(V) units to incorporate Modification Work Order (MWO) 11-5895-1037-30-2.  These tasks include repair of Weapon Replaceable Assemblies (WRA), Line Replaceable Units (LRU) and indentured Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRA).  The services and materials to  be provided to the government will not reflect total government repair needs, but only the repair and availability needs that, which at any given point in time, are discovered to be above and beyon d that which government depot facility can accomplish in the timeframe necessary, using government depot facilities and/or other levels of repair (AVIM, AVUM, SRA etc.).

<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command Hawaii (NAVFAC Hawaii) is extending the current 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) from November 30, 2007 to November 29, 2008 and is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) construction firms with SBA Hawaii District Office or 8(a) certified construction firms with a bona fide place of business in Hawaii or Guam to participate in this BOA program.  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the government reserving the right to exercise extensions up to three years.  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) construction firms that are located in Hawaii or Guam.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the NAVFAC Hawaii and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement.  Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.  Under the BOA, firms with an applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code compete on Task Orders.  The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines).  Only NAICS code sectors 236, 237 and 238 pertain to this BOA.  Each firm will identify the NAICS codes that reflect it?s performance and qualifications for which it would like to be considered.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement.  The task order range will be established at $25,000 to $1,000,000.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety letter (as applicable) and for each proposal over $25,000 and Performance and Payment Bonds on each Task Order.  Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  The Contracting officer will open / advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year.  Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly.  No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate.  Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any task orders previously issued.  The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder.  Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification.  This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party.  Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation.  Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place task orders under the BOA.  Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA.  Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible.  To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria and the criteria listed on the 8(a) BOA Checklist:  (1)  Be a certified 8(a) construction firm under the SBA Hawaii District Office; or with certified 8(a) construction firm with a bona fide place of business in Hawaii or Guam;  (2)  Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, http://www.ccr.gov, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), http://www.bpn.gov; and VETS-100 http://vets100.cudenver.edu/ (if not applicable, provide statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3)  Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $25,000.00 to $1,000,000.00; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS sectors 236, 237, and /or 238 within the last three years.

II.	GENERAL INFORMATION EPA is seeking input from the industry on the re-compete of contract 68-D-03-052.  The Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) is a long-term environmental monitoring network that measures changes in ambient air quality and assesses atmospheric deposition over broad geographic regions of the U.S.  Operating since 1987, CASTNET has evolved into a robust monitoring program which currently consists of 87 monitoring stations nationwide.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) operates a majority of the CASTNET monitoring stations.  In cooperation with EPA, the National Park Service (NPS) currently operates 28 stations.  Table 1 is a list of EPA operated CASTNET sites as of October 2007.  The primary monitoring objectives of CASTNET are to: Provide atmospheric data on total acid deposition, nitrogen deposition, rural ground level ozone and other forms of atmospheric pollution; Monitor the status and trends in regional air quality and atmospheric deposition; and Assess and report on geographic patterns and long-term, temporal trends in ambient air pollution and acid deposition. Existing Contract Structure: EPA currently has one hybrid contract with a Base program the is Cost Plus Fixed Fee, a Level of Effort program that is Cost Plus Fixed Fee, and finally a Fixed Rate portion for Laboratory Services. III.	PROPOSED CONTRACT APPROACHES: EPA is studying acquisition strategy alternatives which may be driven, in part, by various contracting approaches aimed at increased technical and cost efficiencies such as Fixed Rate, IDIQ for all areas of the SOW. IV.	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: All interested companies are request to contact Andrea Brunsman, brunsman.andrea@epa.gov , Contracting Officer, by November 2, 2007.

Because of the large demand for hotel rooms and meeting space during the IACP Conference, agencies are assigned hotel space through a lottery system after IACP has secured their rooms and conference facilities.  The hotel requirements used to initially choose a hotel for this conference are as follows: 1) the availability of 400 room nights for the dates above, to include the ATF Special Agent Conference (SAC) which concludes on October 19, 2007; 2) location within close proxmity of the IACP conference at the New Orleans Convention Center; 3) the availability of a spacious room with a least four (4) dedicated outside lines to serve as an ATF command post; and 5) thea availability of meeting rooms to facilitate the SAC conference and small meetings amongst ATF managers and executives.  Eleven (11) hotels, including the W New Orleans Hotels, were surveyed in February 2007 for the IACP lottery.  The nightly rate of and distance of the conference site from the W New Orleans Hotel were equal to or higher than three of the hotels surveyed.  However, these hotels were booked prior to ATF's assigned selection in the lottery.  Also, two other hotels surveyed in the lottery did not have enough rooms or available meeting room space to accommodate ATF's group requirements.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 721110.  The vendor, W New Orleans Hotel, is required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration before award.  All invoices must be submitted electronically to financebranch@atf.gov.  Please contact Amanda Boshears via email amanda.boshears@atf.gov with any questions.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

STATEMETN OF  WORK NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES Project Identification:			Consultation  for Air Quality Science Assessment for Particulate Matter: Human Clinical Studies of Acute Morbidity Period of Performance:		Date of Award ? September, 30, 2009 Type of Purchase Order:		Firm Fixed Price (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) Estimated Level of Effort:	213 Hours for Tasks 1-7  (50 Hours for Optional Tasks 8-9) INTRODUCTION The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As a part of this process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of  Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the Criteria Air Pollutants in an Integrated Science Assessment (ISA), historically known as an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is now in the process of reviewing the NAAQS for particulate matter  (PM).  The last review of the PM NAAQS was completed in 2006.  At that time, the EPA lowered the level of the 24-hour PM2.5 standard from 65 ?g/m3 to 35 ?g/m3, and retained the current annual fine particle standard of 15 ?g/m3.  The Agency also retained the existing national 24-hour PM10 standard  of 150 ?g/m3, while revoking the annual PM10 standard.  The Agency is now initiating the next review of these standards.  The current review of the NAAQS for PM is targeted for completion in October 2011, to meet the five year-interval requirement for review of the criteria and NAAQS for PM (as  described in the Clean Air Act, section 109(d)(1)).  As one of the first steps in the review process, the first external draft of the PM ISA is targeted for release in August 2008 for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) and the public at a public meeting to be held in  autumn 2008.  The EPA?s proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for the second draft and final PM ISA. The scientific information on PM shall be evaluated, integrated and synthesized in an Integrated Science Assessment and its annexes.  Initial draft materials for the ISA and  annexes will be reviewed at a peer review workshop sponsored by the EPA.  These initial draft materials for the ISA will be written prior to the peer review meeting using discipline-specific (i.e., epidemiology, toxicology, controlled human exposures, etc.) findings from each respective section and  integrating them into a concise document.  Following this meeting, the ISA will be revised based on author and peer reviewer comments, resulting in an external review draft which will be released for public comment and CASAC review.  The EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the PM ISA for public  and CASAC review prior to the completion of the final PM ISA.   Under this order, as outlined in the tasks described in the statement of work, the EPA seeks the professional services of an expert scientist(s) to assist with the review, critical evaluation summary, and integration of the available  scientific database on human health risks from PM exposure.  In particular, assisting in the preparation of the PM ISA sections related to human clinical studies (controlled human exposures). TASKS The Contractor shall accomplish the following tasks and shall complete these tasks according to the  estimated deliverable schedule below.  Because of the importance of these tasks to EPA?s mandated environmental objectives, any late deliverables may negatively affect the outcome of the entire project.         TASK 1.	Submit an Expanded Section Outline and Joint Quality Management/Quality  Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP) 		The Contractor shall submit a Joint Quality Management/Quality Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP) for the product specified in Task 3 within 10 days of award of the order (see Attachment 1 for an outline of the plan).  The JQM/QAPP shall address issues of quality  assurance and control procedures and issues of the use of secondary data to produce the deliverables specified in Task 3.  The JQM/QAPP must be approved by the EPA Technical Project Officer (PO) within 7 days of receipt. 		In addition to the JQM/QAPP, the Contractor shall submit to the EPA PO an  expanded section outline within 10 days of award of the purchase order.  The expanded outline shall provide a clear presentation of the scientific issues (see Attachment 2) and identify some preliminary key studies to be discussed in the controlled human exposures/clinical studies section of the PM  ISA.  The intent of the outline is to ensure that the Contractor has a clear understanding of the specified technical direction and guidelines for the completion of this section. TASK 2.	Participate in Preliminary Meeting for Authors 		NCEA shall hold a teleconference to assess the current  understanding of PM and the expanded outline provided by the Contractor (Task 1).  This meeting will provide an opportunity to discuss the content and organization of the document as appropriate, and to clarify the requirements in the Statement of Work.  Potential participants will include NCEA  staff and authors or contributors who may participate in the development of the PM ISA.  This teleconference is intended to provide the Contractor with important scientific guidance in fulfilling the tasks and responsibilities outlined in the Statement of Work, and to raise and address issues of  importance in assessing human health effects of PM exposure, specifically within the context of human clinical studies (see Attachment 2).  It will also provide the Contractor with a clear understanding of the nature and schedule of the PM ISA preparation.  The meeting is tentatively scheduled to  take place in November, 2007.  The Contractors shall be notified by the PO of the exact date of the meeting within two weeks of the award. TASK 3.	Prepare Written Section(s) for the ISA Relevant to Health Effects in Response to Controlled Human Exposures 		The Contractor shall prepare a text  section for the PM ISA that concisely reviews the most relevant scientific literature related to health effects following controlled human exposures to PM.  This will include a brief review of the controlled human exposure studies described in the 2004 Air Quality Criteria Document for Particulate  Matter and the 2006 Provisional Assessment of Recent Studies on Particulate Matter, as well as a comprehensive review of all new studies not included in either of these two documents (a sample outline is presented in Attachment 2).  In addition to the text section, the Contractor shall prepare  tables that summarize all newly published studies on the assigned topic. 	In order to successfully complete Task 3, the Contractor shall perform the following subtasks. Subtasks (1)	The Contractor shall present a brief summary of the state of knowledge concerning the evidence from controlled  human exposures on the toxicological effects of PM at the time of the writing of the 2004 PM AQCD and the 2006 Provisional Assessment of Recent Studies on PM.  Key conclusions shall be presented, which will frame the discussion of new studies and issues.   (2)	The Contractor shall perform a  comprehensive and detailed literature search of all new peer-reviewed articles, books, and reports, either published or accepted for publication, that present relevant health effects data and information from controlled human exposures to PM that were not included in the previous PM AQCD.  The  Contractor shall provide information on QA procedures used to conduct the comprehensive literature search, including keywords, specific databases and search engines used, and limits placed on the searches.  The basis used for selecting controlled human exposure literature for the present assessment  include whether a given study reports sufficient information on:  Particle type and collection or generation method  Analyses of effects of specific types of PM or indicators related to PM sources (e.g., diesel exhaust, concentrated ambient particles, wood smoke, etc.) and/or size fractions  PM  exposure concentration  Exposure duration  Exposure system (i.e., exposure chamber, bronchial instillation, etc.) Analytical and statistical methods Using these criteria, the Contractor shall document reasons for which potentially relevant studies have been omitted from inclusion in the human  clinical section. (3)	For each study identified from Task 3, Subtask 2, the Contractor shall evaluate and consider: PM sources, components, or other characteristics that may be responsible for the observed health outcomes Method(s)/instrument(s) used to characterize PM properties If the measured  health endpoints were meaningful If the analyses used were appropriate and properly performed and interpreted If study design limitations were acknowledged If the reported findings were internally consistent, biologically plausible, and coherent with other known facts and/or studies In addition,  for each study the Contractor shall document available human subject ethics information, which may include information on informed consent, institution review approval, and ethics standards under which the study was conducted.  (4)	The Contractor shall prepare tables describing the newly published  studies, which shall include for each study: Number, age and health status of subjects tested within each gender Particle type, size, component, source, and origin Method(s)/instrument(s) used to characterize PM properties Exposure concentration and duration Exposure protocol (e.g., intermittent  exercise, co-exposures, etc.) Principal study findings along with study strengths and weaknesses (5)	The Contractor shall perform a balanced and objective evaluation that summarizes, interprets, and synthesizes the most important studies in the controlled human exposure literature on the health  effects of PM.  This shall include an integrated discussion of data from new studies, as well as studies that have been described in the previous PM AQCD.  To the extent possible, the review shall include a comparison of study results with different PM components or sources, as well as a discussion  of possible mechanisms and pathways responsible for the observed health effect.  In addition to the written text, the results and conclusions of the studies shall be presented in quantitative summary tables and figures as appropriate. As part of this subtask, the Contractor shall summarize and  integrate the literature in a manner that addresses the issues that have been identified and revised throughout the process of development of the document.  For the health effects reviewed, the Contractor shall provide a clinical and public health perspective and identify new issues and literature  as appropriate.  The Contractor shall develop this work product to aid in the development of the ISA, a concise and focused assessment that addresses the issues identified and provides the framework for the PM NAAQS.  The Contractor shall also provide EPA with a copy of all journal articles  referenced and include a thorough bibliography of references.        TASK 4.	Review and Evaluate the Preliminary Draft of the Health Effects Chapter of the PM ISA and Attend the Peer Review Workshop to Discuss the Draft 	A preliminary draft of the health effects chapter of the PM ISA will be  developed by the EPA using the drafts of the authors? sections from the various health disciplines (e.g., human clinical, epidemiology, toxicology, etc.).  The Contractor shall review and provide written comments on this entire chapter prior to the peer review workshop.  The draft chapter will be  provided to the Contractor by the PO two weeks in advance of the event.    	The Contractor shall attend the peer review workshop which will be convened to review the draft section(s) and preliminary health effects chapter of the ISA to ensure that issues pertinent to review of the PM NAAQS have  been adequately addressed, and that all relevant, new literature has been identified.  The Contractor shall be present to discuss his/her specific draft section of the PM ISA, as well as to provide input on other related draft sections.  This workshop is expected to take place over a two day period  in April 2008. TASK 5.

A post-meeting written response to comments shall be  delivered to the EPA PO two weeks after the workshop. 	Upon receipt of the revised drafts, the EPA will process the various sections to produce a unified word processed draft version of the PM ISA that includes text, figures, tables, and references.  In so doing, the EPA will first examine the  text for quality control, both technical and editorial, and implement appropriate revisions.  The EPA will then integrate the material across the various sections and chapters of the document, and will interpret the overall available information.  The Contractor shall be available to assist in the  development and synthesis of the ISA.  The EPA will assume primary authorship of the ISA in this process.  Contributing authors are listed in the final document as appropriate. TASK 6.

A sample similar type monument cap showing the quality of inscription, depth of indentation, and degree of polish acceptable under terms of this contract is available for inspection at some of the Bureau of Land Management offices listed in Attachment 1. 4.1.3 MONUMENT CAP MAGNET: The monument cap shall have a ceramic magnet permanently attached within the cap socket and retained by mechanical means. For aid in assembly, an adhesive may be used in ADDITION to the mechanical retention. The ceramic magnet shall be capable of remaining in place should there be no adhesive or the adhesive should unbond between the monument cap or the ceramic magnet. 0-1 Recommended minimum magnet dimensions are as shown in Drawing No.2 (Section 0Attachments ). The monument cap magnet shall have a minimum detection range of at least 3.5 feet when using a Schonstedt Instrument Company, model GA-52C metal detector, or an equivalent metal detector. 4.1.4 PIPE CAP RIVET: The cap rivet shall be 3/16" x 3" flat or oval head rivet, solid stainless steel, type 304 or equivalent. Equivalency is based on the durability and corrosion resistant properties in the following environments: acids, bases (alkaline), salts, and dissimilar materials (reduced galvanic reaction). 4.1.5 MONUMENT PIPE The monument pipe is made from Type 304 or Type 316 stainless steel, Schedule 10 pipe, with a nominal inside diameter of 2 inches and cut 30" long. The actual pipe inside diameter is 2.157 inches (2 5/32 inches). The pipe wall thickness is 0.109 inches (7/64 inches). The actual pipe outside diameter is 2.375 inches (2 3/8 inches). The stainless steel pipe may be either seamless or continuous butt welded. If there is a seam, it must be flush both on the inside and outside of the stainless steel pipe. 4.1.6 PIPE BASE The pipe base shall be either cut as shown in Drawing No.3 (Section D-Attachments) or notched as shown in Drawing No. 4 (Section D-Attachments). The 4 cuts or 4 notches in each pipe base must be equally spaced. All of the monuments in each individual order shall be shipped either flared or unflared as specified by that specific order. Flared monuments shall be flared 5 112 ins. ? 1/4 in. (See Drawing Nos. 3 and 4 in Section D-Attachments.) 4.1.7 ASSEMBLY: The monument cap shall be pressed onto the top of the pipe with a firm fit and shall bottom inside the cap. The cap and pipe shall be drilled, fitted, and set with a rivet. A matched through hole shall be drilled for the rivet using a guided "V" block, or equivalent, to assure the hole is drilled on the pipe center line. Sufficient edge material must be allowed to prevent the rivet hole from cracking out when the rivet is set. The rivet must be installed and finished with at least 5/16 inches diameter material on each end of the rivet after it is set (battered). The final set (battered) rivet must be tight against the brass cap with no visible movement. 0-2 If requested, the awardee(s) shall be sent, at the expense of the government, a sample of a similar type survey monument. The sample similar type survey monument shall be returned, at the expense of the contractor, at the time the first article is submitted. 4.1.8 FINISH The finished monuments must be free of grease and mechanical oil on the exterior surfaces. Unflared monuments shall have no sharp burrs, capable of cutting an ungloved hand, on the exposed portions on the exterior of the monument. 4.1.9 SHIPPING All items furnished under this contract shall be handled in such a manner to protect them from any damage while in the possession of the Contractor. The Contractor shall pack all items for delivery consistent with standard commercial practices to ensure carrier acceptance and to provide adequate protection from shipping damage or loss during transit to the contract designated destination point. The Contractor shall be responsible for any damage or loss caused by improper packaging and any damage or loss while in transit. The survey monuments shall arrive in a neat and orderly condition, (not loose). Weight per skid (or container) shall not exceed 2000 pounds. Each individual skid (or container) shall not exceed 4 feet in length, width, or height. Each shipping container shall be clearly marked with the address and destination, contract number, delivery order number if applicable, item nomenclature, contractor's name, address and date of shipment, number of items per container, number of containers, weight of each container, and weight of each container with the items (gross weight). 4.3 SPECIFICATIONS 4.3.1 Sub-Surface Mae:net 4.3.2 GENERAL The sub-surface magnet assembly, also called a magnetic marker, is required by the government surveyor to be deposited and oriented at the base of the hole which has been excavated for the setting of a survey monument post. The sub-surface magnet is a cylindrical ceramic magnet housed within a plastic container. 4.3.3 Magnet The magnet shall be 7/8 +1- 1/32 inches diam. and 1 +1- 1/8 inch long. The magnet shall be composed of strontium ferrite (chemically inert and anisotropic) 4.3.4 Container The magnet plastic container shall be I 718 to 2 5/8 inches overall length, with 1 to I 118 inches square end caps on a 1 to 1 1/8 in. diam. cylinder. It is preferable that the magnet does not move about within the plastic container. 0-3 The magnet plastic container shall be composed of polyethylene or equivalent end caps with a polyethylene or cellulose acetate cylinder or equivalent. The magnet plastic container shall have one end cap black in color, and marked "THIS END DOWN", "THIS SIDE DOWN", "BOTTOM", or equivalent nomenclature. The other end cap and cylinder will be white or translucent white. Upon final assembly, the case shall have no holes which would permit the intrusion of water. 4.3.5 General The total weight of the magnet and plastic container is approximately 2 ounces. The sub-surface magnet assembly, when deposited in the ground and oriented with the black colored end cap down, shall be detectable with a Schonstedt Instrument Company magnetic locator, model No. GA52C or equivalent at a minimum range of 8 feet below a typical ground surface. 4.3.6 Assembly The sub-surface magnet assembly shall be shipped assembled with the magnet contained and properly oriented in the plastic container with both end caps attached. If the plastic end cap(s) are of a friction fit on the plastic cylinder, they shall be of a tight enough friction fit to require a minimum of 2 hands to disassemble the plastic container. The minimum tightness of the friction fit specification is to prevent the accidental disassembly of the sub-surface magnet assembly in shipping, handling, or carrying in a backpack by a surveyor. In the event that a hole exists in the case for an aid for air escape during assembly, it shall be plugged with silicone type material or equivalent upon assembly to prevent later water intrusion into the case. The magnet will be oriented in the plastic container in order that the maximum detectable magnetic range is obtained (on the ground surface from the sub-surface magnet) when the black colored plastic end cap is placed in a downward position when the magnet is assembled in the plastic container and vertically aligned. 4.3.7 Shipping The assembled sub-surface magnet assemblies, in their containers and considering their magnetic fields, will be packed vertically in a neat and orderly fashion in horizontal rows columns and vertical columns, with no spaces (not loose), and will be contained in a minimum of a cardboard box container, designed for shipping, not exceeding 2 cubic feet. Each shipping container shall be clearly marked with the address and destination, contract number, delivery order number if applicable, item nomenclature, contractor's name, address and date of shipment, number of items per container, number of containers, and weight of each container. 0-4 Compliance with Chapter 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Department of Transportation, hazardous material transportation, regarding magnetized material, is the contractor's responsibility.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This request is an announcement for information/market research for planning purposes. The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, invitation for bid nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.


The 526 ICBMSG/PKA, Hill AFB, Utah is seeking potential sources to develop, test, deliver and install a Linear Acceleration Vibrator System at Honeywell, Clearwater FL.  The Linear Acceleration Vibrator System will be utilized for dynamic testing of the Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer (16-PIGA) inertial instrument used in the Minuteman-III Weapon System.  It will provide precisely defined dynamic acceleration exposure to the instrument under test.  This acceleration exposure is necessary to determine modeling terms for the 16-PIGA in support of engineering investigations.  The system will also be used in assisting engineers in the determination of the true condition of the instrument and support failure investigations of intermittent field failures.  Some of the performance requirements include:  single degree of freedom acceleration in a horizontal plane with a maximum displacement of 10 inches within the 5 ? 100 Hz frequency range; +/- 1dB, 10-100 Hz frequency response;  maximum acceleration of 13 +/- 0.1 g?s in the 10 ? 25 Hz range with less than 4% total harmonic distortion in the acceleration waveform; less than 0.05% cross axis acceleration; magnetic field at the gyro ? less than 5 gauss.  Contract work must demonstrate the Linear Acceleration Vibrator System robustness and repeatability.


THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPORSALS (RFP).  Firms responding to this announcement should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business.

<DESC>The purpose of this request for information is to determine Small Business (SB) capability information for performing modifications on the various systems and sub-systems managed at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC), Robins Air Force Base, Georgia.  The market research Request For Information (RFI) is restricted to responses from SBs only.  It is not anticipated that any one SB or team of SBs will have capabilities across all areas in the Requirements Traceability Matrix included herein.  The intent of the matrix is simply to assist the Government in scoping a SB modifications program/contract by determining in which areas SB capabilities exist.  Those SBs wishing to form teams or joint ventures for responding to this requirement should refer to 13 CFR 121 and contact their SBA District Office for further detailed information on SB teaming, Joint Ventures, and affiliation rules.

This acquisition will be all tasks required for SB modifications to Products and Systems (See Requirements Traceability Matrix).  A modification is defined as an alteration to a Configuration Item (CI) applicable to aircraft, missiles, support equipment, ground stations, software (imbedded), trainers, etc.  As a minimum, the alteration changes the form, fit, function, or interface of the item.  For the purpose of this program, a SB modification is based on proven technologies, mature technical data packages, established systems engineering processes, commercially available design tools, and Commercial Off-The-Shelf components.

It is anticipated that this program will provide a multiple award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) task-ordering capability for the procurement of SB modifications and may include engineering, technical, logistics, and other services, spares and repairs in support of SB modifications (hardware and software) for the enhancement of reliability, serviceability, and maintainability, and performance improvements.  Also, this program may include non-recurring engineering, technical documentation, trial installations, ground and flight-testing, kit-proof technical support, kit manufacture and production installation.

<DESC>This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but a survey to locate potential sources capable of performing the work described below. It is anticipated that a Contractor will be required for an effort to investigate the effects of seismic and related multi-hazard loads on structures, non-structural components and other issues such as land movement and tsunami as they are identified by FEMA; to develop technical design and construction guidance products; to mitigate damages; and to support the dissemination of these products and related outreach efforts based on these products. These voluntary resource guidance products present criteria for the design, construction, upgrade, and function of buildings subject to earthquake ground motions in or as well as other hazards that inflict loads on structures so as to minimize the risk to life for all buildings, increase the expected performance of higher occupancy structures, and improve the capability of essential facilities to function during and after earthquakes and other hazards anywhere in the United States. 

FEMA has had considerable success in attracting some of the best earthquake engineers, structural engineers, civil engineers and scientists to assist in the development of these FEMA resource products. Because of this, our products have been widely used by practicing design professionals and building officials. The techniques and technologies contained in these products are being incorporated into national model building codes and consensus and industry standards. The objective of this proposed contract will be to establish a process for the contracting of specific tasks to support the investigation of seismic and other related multi-hazard technical issues as they are identified by FEMA, the development and publication of technical design and construction guidance products to address those issues, the dissemination of those products, and support of training and related outreach activities based on those products to the various user groups who need that information. The specific tasks shall be identified by FEMA with input from the Contractor and various outside sources. 

Minimum capabilities must include documented evidence of experience and expertise in all of the following areas: 1) Demonstrated experience in the investigation and documentation of seismic and multi-hazard technical issues as identified both in the enforcement of seismic building codes and in the investigation of post-earthquake building performance, and of related earthquake ground motion generated hazards, such as tsunami; 2) Demonstrated experience in working with researchers and research programs in addressing advanced seismic and seismic-related technical issues, such as soil-structure interaction; 3) Demonstrated capability of enlisting the services of nationally recognized seismic design and construction experts experienced in the development of technical guidance products, including structural engineering, civil engineering, architecture, earth science, geo-technical, construction, code development and enforcement, public policy, and academic researchers; 4) Demonstrated experience in the development of other seismic and multi-hazard technical design and construction resource guidance documents and other related products; and 5) Demonstrated experience in the development of training materials and marketing/outreach programs that promote the use seismic and multi-hazard technical design and construction guidance products. Each of these requirements shall be rated equally. 

Firms with these capabilities are invited to submit complete information to the procuring office identified in this notice in three (3) copies within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this notice. Information furnished should include: 1) the number and professional qualifications of scientists, engineers, technical, and other appropriate personnel; 2) company experiences related to the proposed project; 3) a description of general and special facilities; 4) a current financial statement; and 5) other literature which demonstrates minimum capabilities listed above. Submission of complete information to the procuring officer by electronic means is acceptable. 

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted. Based upon responses received, the Government reserves the right to set aside any and all procurements that may result hereunder for small or minority-owned businesses. If the evaluation of responses received concludes that none of the responding firms have the necessary capabilities, negotiations may be conducted with the Applied Technology Council on a noncompetitive basis.

<OFFADD>Comm for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Committee for Purchase, Committee for Purchase, 1421 Jefferson Davis Highway Jefferson Plaza #2, Room 10800, Arlington, VA, 22202-3259, UNITED STATES
<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Folder, Classification to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of classification folders by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following products to the P/L:

 
Folder, File Classification, 4part, Legal
7530-00-NIB-0824 (Earth Red) 
7530-00-NIB-0825 (Light Green)
 
The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY. 
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Classification Folders to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

ACC-16034				ACC-16044
SJP-S61950				SJP-S61951			
ESS-2157 R				ESS-2157 GRN
SMD-18775				SMD-18776
GLW-PU-44-RED			GLW-PU-44-GRN
UNV-10260				UNV-10261
NAT-01092

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing classification folders to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 7, and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<SUBJECT>X -- Sole Source Notice
<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Colorado Springs World Arena) under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 2 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally by considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon the following justification.  The USAF Academy Band performs several public concerts in Colorado Springs each year in support of the community relations mission.  In order to fulfill this mission, a concert hall must be rented.  The best venue to meet our needs is the Pikes Peak Center.  2007 and 2008 Performance dates are as follows:     
10 Dec 07 - Concert Band load-in and evening performance
11 Dec 07 ? Evening Performance
12 Dec 07 ? Evening Performance
17 Feb 08 - Performance
20 Apr 08 - Performance
12 May 08 - Concert Band load-in and rehearsal
13 May 08 - Concert Band performance - Armed Forces Week concert
7 Aug 08 - Concert Band load-in and rehearsal
8 Aug 08 - Concert Band performance
Statutory Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  See FAR 6.302-1.  The Pikes Peak Center is the only local venue available that can offer size, acoustics and logistical support for events of this magnitude.  Therefore, we request only the Pikes Peak Center be considered for award of this contract.  It is essential that The United States Air Force Academy Band and the United States Air Force produce the highest quality community-relations performances possible.  The Pikes Peak Center possesses all the equipment, experience, acoustic properties and unsurpassed first-hand knowledge necessary to accomplish musical performances in a world-class manner.  The Pikes Peak Center is uniquely qualified to hold our events because it is the only acoustically viable venue large enough to handle the 2000 plus audience attendees (per concert) within the Colorado Springs area.

HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [Jun 2006]   
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional cost that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Commercial Items (Sep 2007) Offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision with offer or complete only paragraph (j) of the provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov .  If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) through (i) of this provision.

"The U.S. Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center has a requirement for various software program subscriptions including: Military Specs & Standards, DoD Adopted Industry Standards, AV Data (Air Worthiness Directives and Federal Aviation Requiements),Haystack Gold, Worldwide Specs and Standards andAIA Specs and Standards. The standards need to be downloadable for immediate access.  Market research has identified only one known source, Information Handling Services, capable of providing a one year subscription for the required software programs.  Market research identified various "users" of the same software programs, however it appears these users all use Information Handling Services as their source of supply. Based on these market research results only Information Handling Service is known to be able to meet the government?s requirement". LEGAL EFFECT OF QUOTATIONS (FAR 13.004) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract.  The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions.  A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offers.  The supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered, by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.  When appropriate the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order in writing.

(a) Prohibitions. 

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional cost that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a paper solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is MCC-08-0014-RFQ-79, and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ), with incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17.  A firm fixed price contract is anticipated.  The period of performance is one year with options for four additional years. This requirement is being synopsized under the North American Industry Classification System code 524114 - Direct Health and Medical Insurance Carriers, and the size standard is $6.5M.

Description:  

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), 875 Fifteenth Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20005, intends to acquire medical assistance services for its personnel traveling and living abroad.  The purpose is to obtain emergency medical assistance services 24 hours/7 days a week when the traveler and/or eligible family member is 100 or miles away from their permanent residence on official travel or a permanent assignment.  The following is a sampling of the countries in which travel may occur:

Armenia, Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Dominican Republic, East Timor, Ecuador, Georgia, Ghana, Honduras, Jordan, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Moldova, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, United States, Vanuatu.

A medical emergency is defined as physical, mental and/or natal.  

All MCC employees and their eligible family members traveling on official temporary duty orders or official permanent assignment orders are under the direct jurisdiction of the U.S. Ambassador.  As such, the U.S. Embassy serves as the first point of contact in most emergency situations.  If a traveler is injured, becomes ill or is deemed mentally unstable and adequate medical care is not available, the selected contractor will work in tandem with the U.S. Embassy medical staff, when such staff is available.  Final decisions on medical evacuations able to MCC are to be in joint consultation between the contractor, the U.S. Embassy medical staff and if possible the injured party or his/her guardian.

The following services are not required but are HIGHLY DESIRABLE:
The countries to which MCC permanently assigns its employees are considered inadequate for safe births.  All pregnant personnel must be medically evacuated for a period of three months - six weeks prior to and six weeks post birth.   The medical evacuation includes the pregnant female and minor children that the spouse remaining in country is unable to care for.

Deliverables:

A.  The contractor will provide standard ID cards and program descriptions to MCC for each covered employee.

B.  If a traveler is left alone or hospitalized for more than 7 days, the contractor will coordinate for a family member to join them.

C.  If minor children are left unattended due to a medical emergency, the contractor will coordinate their return home, accompanied by a qualified escort if necessary.

D.  If a traveler should pass away while on official travel, the contractor will arrange for their remains to be returned to their permanent residence.

E.  The contractor will facilitate the transfer of medication, vaccines and blood products if unsafe or unavailable in country.

F.  The contractor will provide the following medical assistance services:

-  In the event of illness of injury, the contractor will make new reservations for airlines, hotels and other travel services as needed.
-  The contractor will assist in replacing passports, tickets and other important documents.
-  The contractor can provide immediate translation services in a variety of languages and/or referrals to local interpretation services. 
-  Travelers may send and receive emergency messages via the contractor.
-  The contractor will provide medical referrals for worldwide medical and dental care.
-  When consent is given, the contractor will notify appropriate individuals of the situation.
-  When consent is given, the contractor will transfer medical information and records to the traveler or the appropriate physician.
-  The contractor will arrange for the replacement of corrective lenses or medical devices if they are lost, stolen or broken during travel.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Far Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. The NAICS code is 517110 with a small business size standard of 1,500 employees. 

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Comcast Online, P.O. Box 827554, Philadelphia, PA 19102 for the requirement of high speed internet services. 

This is a continuation of existing services. Comcast has been providing these services to the NLM for the past six years and is the only known source of providing these services. Comcast is the largest provider of Broadband services in the country with a presence in 40 states and reaches into 40% of U.S. households including more than 70% coverage of the greater D.C. market.

Cable companies, in most cases, do not overlap geographically. Therefore, cable Internet services are usually only available from a single provider in any given geographic area. For example, in the greater D.C. area, Comcast is the primary cable provider in Montgomery County, Prince George County, Prince William County, Arlington, Alexandria, and Reston, VA. DSL bandwidth is distance sensitive and hence is not available in many areas; and not available with enough bandwidth for NLM's applications in other areas. Therefore, Comcast cable services are the only known option available for the broadest coverage for NLM remote staff and contractors. 

Comcast offers speeds of Standard 6.0 Mbps downstream and 768 Kbps upstream on their Teleworker Standard product and 8.0 Mbps downstream and 768 Kbps upstream on their Enhanced product.

The contractor shall provide a report with the information listed below.  The report shall be of quality to be publishable in the peer-reviewed literature.  Three separate reports shall be provided.  Each report will include descriptions of: 1) the statistical models used to analyze the data; 2) the procedures used to ensure quality of the statistical work; 3) the results shall including: a. list of all parameters for the single-chemical models, b. list of parameters for the  additivity and mixture models, including tests of significance for deviations from dose-additivity, c. calculation of ED30s, plus 95% confidence limits, for the additivity and mixture models; 4) graphical representations of the results; 5) a descriptive text, including any relevant statistical equations, that explains the design for experimentally testing additivity of a complex mixture of pyrethroids, and corresponding bibliography when applicable; 6) Conclusions based on the statistical analyses; 7) The contractor shall provide electronic files that document, validate and explain all the procedures applied to reach a final decision on testing the default hypothesis of dose-addition and construct the formal report. The electronic format for storing these electronic files (i.e., CD or DVD) will contain copies of the original  files for all graphical (single-compound and mixture dose-response curves or plots) or schematic (e.g., mathematical expressions) representations prepared using user-friendly formats (preferable Excel or SigmaPlot for graphical plots, and Word, Word Perfect or PowerPoint for text, mathematical expressions, tables, diagrams, or any schematics).  ATTACHMENT A - SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES.  The contractor shall provide analytical services for each study, described below for each of three projects.  Each service, or study, shall constitute a separate deliverable.  Studies.  There shall be three projects based on the endpoint examined: motor activity, cellular activity, and ion flux.  A deliverable shall include the analyses of each project, i.e., three final products. 1.  Motor Activity:  A total of 5  pyrethroids will be included in this mixture.  Dose-response data will then be collected for two mixtures, using each of these endpoints.  The mixing ratio will be defined by: A) relative potencies of the individual chemicals, and B) relative human exposure to the individual chemicals based on EPA projections of food, water, and air exposures. For the motor activity endpoint, the dose-response data has already been analyzed and relative potencies were previously determined (see Wolansky et al., 2006).  These values may be re-calculated under this contract if required. 2.  Cellular Activity:  Up to 11 pyrethroids will be included in this mixture.  Each pyrethroid will be tested individually to define the concentration-response characteristics on cellular activity.  Concentration-response data will then be collected for one mixture.  The  mixing ratio will be defined by relative human exposure to the individual chemicals based on EPA projections of food, water, and air exposures.  3. Ion Flux: Up to 11 pyrethroids will be included in this mixture.  Each pyrethroid will be tested individually to define the concentration-response  characteristics on ion flux.  Concentration-response data will then be collected for one mixture.  The mixing ratio will be defined by relative human exposure to the individual chemicals based on EPA projections of food, water, and air exposures.  Total, 3 studies to be analyzed. Statistical Basis of Analysis.  The data shall be analyzed by the dose-additivity models previously described, the so-called ?single chemicals required method? (Casey et al., 2004; Gennings et al., 1997, 2002, 2003a,b, 2004; Meadows et al., 2003).   Specifically, single-chemical data shall be used, under an assumption of dose-additivity, to predict the response of a fixed-ratio mixture.  A nonlinear threshold model will be fit to the mixture data in terms of total dose along the specified fixed-ratio of the chemicals.  An overall test of additivity shall be performed by comparing the two models.  The contractor may elect, based on the professional judgments of the contractor, to examine the data by other advanced statistical techniques. 1. Definition of Additivity: a. The single chemical dose-response data will be used to estimate an additivity model. b. The additivity model used shall be based on the definition of additivity (i.e., zero interaction) given by Berenbaum (e.g., 1985) and is based on the classical isobolograms for the combination of two chemicals  (e.g., Loewe and Muischnek, 1926; Loewe, 1953). 2.  Preliminary study of the relationship between the mean and variance. a. Throughout the analysis of these data, a quasi-likelihood estimation method shall be used which is based on assumptions of the model for the mean as a function of dose and the relationship between the variance and the mean. b. Graphs of the sample variances versus sample means shall be used to illustrate the form of this relationship. 3. Estimation of the Additivity Model. a. The method of maximum quasi-likelihood shall be used to estimate model parameters. b. The adequacy of the fit of the additivity model to the single chemical data will be assessed through a goodness-of-fit test and will be assessed graphically, i.e., the observed and model predicted responses for each single chemical  shall be provided. c. The estimated additivity model will be used to predict the mean response along the fixed mixing ratio of the chemicals in terms of total dose. A plot of the predicted response under additivity along the mixture ray in terms of total dose also shall be provided. d. An overall test for departure of the experimental data from the predicted additivity model shall be provided. e. Individual data point predictions will include both the predicted value and the 95% prediction interval for the estimate. f. In addition, a table of parameter estimates, standard errors, and p values will be included in the analysis report.  4. Estimation of the Mixture Model. a. A nonlinear threshold model will be fit to the mixture data. b. A plot of the observed and model predicted responses in terms of total dose shall be  provided. Included in this graph will be the predicted curve under the assumption of additivity. c. Adequacy of the model fit shall be conducted graphically. d. A table of estimated model parameters, standard errors, and p values will be included in the analysis report. e. Using additivity models as described in Gennings et al (2002), prediction intervals will be produced under additivity at each mixture group and shall be included in the analysis report.  5. Test of additivity. a. Comparison of the mixture model to the additivity model along the fixed-ratio ray will be statistically conducted based on suitable statistical methods. A 5% significance level will be used. b. The results of the test shall be provided in the analysis report. c. If departure from additivity is detected, the suitability of the data for  estimation of an interaction threshold shall be determined. d. If appropriate, the interaction threshold shall be estimated and reported.  The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors ?Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items.  Evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: The Government intends to award a single contract to the responsible offeror whose technically acceptable quotation represents the best overall value to the Government based on the evaluation of the technical criteria, past performance, and price.  Only those offerors submitting technically acceptable quotations shall be considered for award.  For the purpose of this best value evaluation of technically acceptable proposals, technical capabilities and  past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The following is a description of each evaluation criterion, including information which must be included with the response: I.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.
