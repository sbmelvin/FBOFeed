<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR the Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III Space Qualified Solar Cell Supply Chain Project. This is a pre-solicitation synopsis which is not a request for competitive proposals. The purpose of this project is to establish a qualified domestic source for the manufacture of solar cell germanium (Ge) substrates to meet National Security Space (NSS) requirements. The DPA Title III Program Office intends to award a contract or a Technology Investment Agreement, as appropriate, on the basis of less than full and open competition for this requirement to Sylarus Technologies, 4167 South River Rd., St. George, UT, 84790. The U.S. Government is contemplating this procurement under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.). In accordance with the DPA statutory definition of "domestic", the offeror must perform in the US or Canada substantially all of the research and development, engineering, manufacturing, and production activities related to establishing and maintaining a domestic germanium substrate manufacturing capability. This project will leverage prior work performed in development of a domestic source for the manufacture of germanium substrates. Key tasks in this effort include developing, improving, and implementing: Ge crystal growth manufacturing processes; Ge substrate preparation processes; quality assurance, testing and inspection processes; and packaging and shipping processes. The selected contractor shall demonstrate an existing ability to manufacture Ge substrates to meet space-qualified NSS applications. A thorough and credible Producibility Improvement Plan is required to demonstrate the recipient's ability to positively affect its manufacturing yields, throughput, quality and unit costs. An Integration and Validation Plan is also required to document and track the degree to which the recipient's Ge substrate manufacturing capability is satisfying NSS requirements. Additionally, the selected contractor shall demonstrate it possesses sufficient marketing and customer sales experience to support the unique product specifications and requirements of its Government customers. Key tasks also include development and implementation of a comprehensive strategic business plan and a marketing plan to address both Government and commercial applications for this technology. The period of performance for the procurement is anticipated to be 63 months.
<p>The Government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), "Only One Responsible Source" or "DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400 (b)," based on the aforementioned requirements, as well as an assessment of technical and programmatic risk to the Government. Offerors who are capable of meeting the requirements stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing (either electronically or mail), to the POCs listed above, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. This documentation shall specify the offeror's area of expertise and experience. It shall identify the offeror's current production capabilities and capacities for producing germanium substrates for NSS applications. The offeror shall provide documentation that it possesses sufficient company infrastructure and resources to support the production of germanium substrates, and certify its compliance with the DPA definition of "domestic". Documentation shall also include a listing of products and services currently offered along with market share. The documentation shall identify relevant production experience, and a listing of both Government and commercial customers that currently possess and utilize the offeror's germanium substrates. Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered. Direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting point of contacts listed above in this announcement. Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency. See Numbered Note 22.*****</p>

For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes. (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable).<br>This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for quote/proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a quote/proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Solicitation Number W911S1-11-T-0265 is assigned for reference purposes.

Please be advised that hard copies of the solicitation will not be made available; you must download solicitation documents from the ASFI. All potential sources must obtain a DUNS number and register in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) in order to transact business with the government. Failure to obtain a DUNS number and register in the CCR may result in the delay of award of a contract or possible award to the next otherwise successful offeror who is registered in the CCR at the time of award.

<SUBJECT>MAIDETS Application Revision and Update
<SOLNBR>2011-Q-13640
<RESPDATE>072011
<ARCHDATE>10202011
<CONTACT>Margaret L Mooney, Purchasing Agent, Email zia3@cdc.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Researh (OMSHR), hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to PENTAD Systems for MAIDETS Application Revision and Update..
<p>Purpose and Objective: The mission of NIOSH's Office of Mine Safety and Health Research is to eliminate mining fatalities, injuries, and illnesses through research and prevention. The program, which began in 1910 under the U.S. Bureau of Mines, has contributed significantly to safety and health improvements in the mining industry. Mine safety research engineering needs and targeting is dependent on mine accident, injury and illness surveillance data. It is important to have current, relevant data. Fast and systematic procedures to accurately process, analyze, and distribute these data are vital.</p>
<p>MAIIDETS is an intranet application (http://maiidetsdev.cdc.gov/) that uses an array of application programming interfaces (API's) and internally developed application tools to process the Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA) data from the agency's "Address and Employment", "Accident , Injury, and Illness", and "Area and Personal Samples" data files available from MSHA at http://www.msha.gov/STATS/PART50/p50y2k/p50y2k.HTM. or on an individual mine basis from their "Mine Data Retrieval System" (http://www.msha.gov/drs/drshome.htm). Though the MAIIDETS application hosts direct access to mine and accident data summary tables and charts, it is most useful to researchers for its interactive capabilities. MAIIDETS offers users the ability to build custom datasets and provides tools to examine, analyze, map, and report results from these datasets. The application was designed to make MSHA data more transparent and easily accessible to both frequent and occasional users. Though MAIIDETS is supplementary to other in-house analysis tools, the application's goal is to offer interactive tools that provide standardized methods that produce consistent results across a wide range of user skills. MAIIDETS also could serve as a host for future data sharing/integration opportunities for noise, demographic, and mine equipment data. Top third party applications were integrated into the application to enhance and expand output capabilities.</p>
<p>This statement of work for the revision and update of MAIIDETS delineates the tasks needed to make the application operational on CDC servers in Atlanta. The tasks delineate the work necessary to make MAIIDETS fully functional, utilizing "state of the art" code. MAIIDETS will also need to be loaded with MSHA Mine Address and Employment, and Accident, Injury, and Illness data from 1983 through 2010.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following tasks.</p>
<p>Task 1: Deploy and Host MAIIDETS on a Fully Functional Development Server</p>
<p>The MAIIDETS application is currently housed on a server in Atlanta. The contractor shall install and configure MAIIDETS on their own server at their own place of business for testing and development.<br />Task 2: Rewrite .NET and SQL Server Code</p>
<p>The MAIIDETS application is currently written in ASP.NET version 2.0 and SQL Server 2000. The contractor will update MAIIDETS code to .NET 3.5 ( or .NET 4.0 if it is available when coding begins) and SQL Server 2008. Updating will substantially increase MAIIDETS capabilities and efficiencies.<br />Task 3: Install New Third Party Software</p>
<p>OMSHR staff will request from Atlanta ITSO the creation of a consolidated environment for the MAIIDETS ASP.NET application and its database. After Certification and Accreditation of Third Party software and the MAIIDETS application with its database, the contractor will be responsible for installation of newer MAIIDETS upgraded Third Party software on host servers in Atlanta. This will require the contractor to work remotely with ITSO personnel in Atlanta for direct access to the application for updating and modification. The contractor will be responsible to ensure that the most recent versions of Third Party software are installed properly on the correct servers and that their functionality within the MAIIDETS application is fully restored. Purchase and acquisition of the upgraded versions of this software (the 508 Compliant Corda Technologies, server graphing PopCharts / Optimap and Autodesk MapGuide Server software) will be the responsibility of NIOSH OMSHR.<br />Task 4: Load Current and Historic MSHA Data</p>
<p>The contractor shall load SPSS, SAS, or dBase MSHA data files into MAIIDETS. The MSHA data files will be provided by OMSHR. These data will be processed MSHA year-end close-out files covering the time period from 1983 through 2010.<br />Task 5: Correct Coding Errors</p>
<p>The contractor will work with the NIOSH OMSHR surveillance personnel to identify and restore original functionality that once worked but is now reported as an "error". This may be due to programming changes made elsewhere in the application or incompatibility due to system environmental changes that occurred during the application's move from the Spokane server environment to the Atlanta environment. For example, the incidence rate calculator wizard no longer results in a numerical rate output.<br />Task 6: Install Login Security to Enable Restrict-by-Account</p>
<p>MAIIDETS currently has no system limits. The contractor will write into the application a tool that will manage user access rights. The revised system will have a security management system enabling new accounts to be granted "GUEST" privileges as default. A MAIIDETS system administrator will need to have the capability to grant access rights beyond "Guest."<br />Task 7: Reformat Fonts and Style to Conform to NIOSH/CDC Standards<br />The contractor will update the MAIIDETS format style so that it is consistent with fonts and formats of existing OMSHR/NIOSH/CDC web sites.<br />Task 8: Create Working Models for Updating Procedures<br />The contractor will create an update utility to allow OMSHR personnel to add future year's MSHA "close-out" data to the system. This will enable designated personnel with the proper administrative access rights to run stored automated procedures that will update the MAIIDETS Production Server with annual MSHA Address and Employment, Accident Injury and Illness, and Sampling data. <br />Task 9: Create a "Glossary of Terms" and "User Help Guide"<br />The contractor will create a "Glossary of Terms" database widget that can be accessible from anywhere in the MAIIDETS application to look-up definitions of mining terms. The contractor will also create an on-line help manual which will be accessible from anywhere in the system.<br />Task 10: Prepare Final Project Report<br />The contractor will prepare a final report which presents a summary of the work done to update and make functional the MAIIDETS application. This report should also include recommendations for improving the speed, efficiency, and ease of use of MAIIDETS.<br />Special Notes:<br />&#61607; The contractor will document and provide to OMSHR all source code modification of old code and the new code written to update the MAIIDETS application.<br />&#61607; OMSHR will take ownership of all source code and any Third Party tool licenses used in MAIIDETS, other than Microsoft Visual Studio.<br />&#61607; To the maximum extent possible, 508 compliance must be addressed in the reporting, charting, and mapping products of the application.<br />&#61607; The contractor will be required to submit to OMSHR interim installs of builds during development for OMSHR testing and assistance with the certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) process.</p>
<p>No other vendor has the knowledge of or the experience working with the MAIIDETS application as PENTAD Systems. PENTAD worked to transfer the MAIIDETS system to the CDC Atlanta server, and helped the Atlanta personnel configure and launch the system. Pentad Systems also has a working prototype on their own Developmental server and used this to optimize the configuration for Atlanta. The personnel at PENTAD Systems have extensive and expert experience with Accident and Injury data such as management of the safety program at the large Kaiser Aluminum TrentwoodPlant in Spokane Valley, WA. The company has a unique interest and understanding of accident and injury data and incidence rates, use and precautions as well as a sense of reporting format needs from the work done at Kaiser.. The company is familiar with MAIIDETs program language as well as the application itself. PENTAD is sole positioned to commit work on MAIIDETS quickly, efficiently, and cost effectively.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2011-Q-13640. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with PENTAD Systems, 17 West Falcon Avenue, Spokane, WA 99218 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

This instrument detects over 400 different cell lines and 100 primary cells for the high-throughput, accurate and quantitative analysis of mRNA, genomic DNA, siRNA and proteins in biological and experimental samples so as to identify biomarkers of disease progression and to study disease pathogenesis of AIDS and other retroviral infections of the brain.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>Digitalizing Microfilm with Indexing Services</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is for market research to assess what services are available in the commercial marketplace to:</p>
<p>&bull; convert an inventory of microfilmed records into digitalized form; and<br />&bull; implement an indexing schema to facilitate efficient searching of these records once they are in digitalized form.</p>
<p>The microfilmed records in question are maintained by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD).</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Bureau's Office of Retail Securities (ORS) is responsible for providing direct-access services to private individuals and organizations. The Direct-Access program enables these parties to purchase U.S. Treasury debt obligations directly from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and have these security holdings maintained and serviced by ORS.</p>
<p>The most commonly known Direct-Access service provided by ORS is the U.S. Savings Bond program. Savings bonds were first introduced in March of 1935, and continue to be sold to this day. Over the life of the program, Retail has compiled an extensive inventory of records that document the issuance and retirement/redemption of savings bonds. In addition to these savings bond records, there is a smaller segment of records documenting transactions involving other Direct-Access products. These other products include U.S. Treasury marketable securities held in definitive (i.e. paper) form, Current Income Bonds (CIB) and other accrual type securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and held in definitive form.</p>
<p>In the late 1940s, the Bureau started microfilming its transactional records. All existing and subsequent paper records were retained on microfilm and the paper records were destroyed. BPD continued this practice until:</p>
<p>&bull; 1993 for issuance records; and<br />&bull; 2003 for retirement/redemption records.</p>
<p>The existing inventory of records that pre-date the 1993/2003 cut-over to electronic form are retained in microfilm form, and these records were not converted to electronic form. In a very general sense, BPD's microfilmed records break down into four broad categories.</p>
<p>&bull; Numerical Registers which were summary-level ledgers used to record the disposition of a specific bond. These registers were updated manually as transactions were processed. BPD stopped using these ledgers in 1964 when office automation provided a more efficient and viable alternative.</p>
<p>&bull; Registration Stubs/Carbons which were used to record the bond's ownership information when it was issued by an agent. In 1964 BPD began accepting this information from agent via computer output, and in 1993 stop accepting paper-based submissions from agents.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Computer Output to Microfilm (COM) which was the permanent record of the issuance information transmitted by agents to BPD via computer output. At the time COM was in use, the level of information technology was not sufficiently mature to provide a method of permanently retaining this data electronically, so the output was maintained in microfilm format. In 1993, BPD implemented an IT solution to address this issue, and stopped using COM.</p>
<p>&bull; Bonds redeemed or retired were microfilmed as a permanent record. In 2003, BPD implemented an IT solution to receive and store this data electronically, and stopped using microfilm to document these transactions.</p>
<p>BPD maintains two separate sets of microfilm within its library. One set is the original microfilm that is retained as the archival master. The other set is a diazo duplicate of the archival master, which is used by Bureau personnel to perform their official duties. The library consists of almost 1.3 million rolls of 16 millimeter (mm) microfilm. On average each roll contains 9,000 images, and the overall library is estimated to contain approximately 9.9 billion unique images.</p>
<p>The microfilmed images were produced using grayscale with reduction ratios of 1:25 to 1:50. Each microfilm roll is either 100 or 250 feet in length. The microfilm's thickness ranges from 2.50 to 6.00 mm. In general, the film in the Retail microfilm library varies widely in legibility, clarity, density, and so forth, according to the technology available at the time of its creation. Likewise, the size, color, and composition of the source documents varied significantly, and filming procedures over the years were revised and adjusted to accommodate changing program needs. As a result, film images may be simplex or duplex, comic or cine, and still other films contain images on the left side down their length and on the right side up their length.</p>
<p>The library, especially the archival master set, is maintained in a protected environment to preserve its integrity. Obviously, though, microfilm degrades over time despite the best preservation practices. As a result, the overall quality of the microfilm has been compromised to a degree. BPD generally rates the legibility quality of most of the microfilm images to be poor to below average.</p>
<p>Specifics on Market Information Requested</p>
<p>As indicated above, BPD is assessing the feasibility of converting either its entire microfilm library or a portion of it into digital form. This conversion would also implement an indexing schema to facilitate efficient searching of the records. BPD is soliciting information from private firms in order to perform this assessment and to decide on the appropriate course of action. The following items identify the specific issues BPD would want a response to this RFI to address:</p>
<p>Reproduction Standard: The interested vendor should include the reproduction standard (whether a set value or range) usually provided for this service.</p>
<p>Quality Control: BPD needs to ensure that the microfilmed information is accurately and correctly converted to a digital format. The response to the RFI should address what actions (both procedurally and process-wise) the vendor usually implements to ensure quality control.</p>
<p>Indexing Schema: BPD has used a different indexing method based on the time-period that the microfilm was first created. As a result, there are several different indexing methodologies in place throughout the microfilm library. The response to the RFI should address whether the vendor's conversion process can address several different indexing methods.</p>
<p>Optical Character Recognition (OCR): BPD is interested in soliciting information on whether the vendor can use OCR software to develop a more standardized indexing method to search the digitalized images. If the interested vendor's service provides this service, then the response to RFI should address this issue.</p>
<p>Security: Most of the microfilmed records contain sensitive information that is classified as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). U.S. federal law and regulations require that BPD implement certain controls to protect the security of this information. These measures include restricting access to this information to only those individuals who have successfully passed an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) background investigation. The response to the RFI should address whether the vendor's staff includes members who have undergone a successful OPM background investigation and/or are capable of undergoing such an investigation. Furthermore, the response should indicate that the interested vendor is willing to cooperate in full and comply with all requirements placed by BPD to ensure that this information is properly secured.</p>
<p>Coordination: BPD personnel will require access to the microfilm records during the conversion/indexing process. The response to the RFI should address the vendor's plan to accommodate this requirement.</p>
<p>Logistical Issues: BPD will need to know whether the conversion/indexing process:</p>
<p>&bull; Must be performed at the vendor's site;<br />&bull; Can be performed at BPD's facilities; or<br />&bull; Either option can be selected.</p>
<p>The response to the RFI should address what logistical arrangements would be necessary (transportation of the microfilm to the vendor's facility, set-up of the vendor's equipment at BPD's facilities, accommodations for the vendor's staff, etc.), and any additional charges for these activities.</p>
<p>Capacity: BPD fully understands that a single vendor can process only so many microfilm records within a certain time-frame. The response to the RFI should address the vendor's maximum capacity for converting/indexing microfilmed images over a specified time-period.</p>
<p>Responding to the RFI</p>
<p>BPD believes that a written response to this RFI, although useful, would not adequately address the intended goal of this RFI. The market information needed to properly assess a project of this size and complexity would be more adequately acquired through a more interactive venue rather than a passive written response. Consequently, BPD is inviting interested parties wishing to respond to this RFI to make arrangements to discuss their capabilities in a face-to-face presentation with BPD business and technical staff.</p>
<p>BPD will be holding discussions with interested respondents Monday, August 8, 2011 through Friday, August 12, 2011. Each appointment will be limited to a not-to-exceed time of two (2) hours. Interested parties should contact the procurement official via psb3@bpd.treas.gov Attn: RFI-BPD-11-0059 Site Visit WP/MC to make an appointment for the week of August 8, 2011. The presentations will be held at BPD's facilities in Parkersburg, West Virginia.</p>
<p>Each respondent who makes a site visit appointment, may make arrangements to have a sample of BPD's microfilm records provided in advance of the appointment for analysis and assessment. This sample will consist of images of our microfilmed records that have been suitably redacted and sanitized to remove any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). If a respondent is interested in obtaining a sample, please inform the procurement official when making your site visit appointment.</p>
<p><br />Qualified contractors must provide the following:</p>
<p>1. The name and location of your company, contact information, and identify your business size (Large Business, Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HubZone, etc.) based on NAICS Code 518210, size standard $25.0m. Please ensure contact information includes the name of the point of contact, email address, and telephone number should the Government have questions regarding individual responses.</p>
<p>2. Whether your services are available through an existing Government contract vehicle (please provide the contract number) or on the Open Market.</p>
<p>3. A brief capabilities statement that includes a description of your company's standard line of business and experience, the qualifications and certifications of available interpreters, and a list of customers (either public or private sector) your company currently provides these services for.</p>
<p>4. A General fee structure for the services provided</p>
<p>5. Contractors should provide their DUNS, if applicable.</p>
<p><br />The following file extensions are not allowable and application materials/data submitted with these extensions cannot be considered:</p>
<p>.bat, .cmd, .com, .exe, .pif, .rar, .scr, .vbs, .hta, .cpl, and .zip files.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office compatible documents are acceptable.</p>
<p>No other information regarding this Sources Sought Notice will be provided at this time.</p>
<p>This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. All firms responding to this notice are advised that their response is not an offer that will be considered for contract award. All interested parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately from their response to this notice.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. A request for more information, or a copy of the solicitation, will not be considered an affirmative response to this Notice. Telephone responses to, or inquiries about, this Notice will NOT be accepted.</p>
<p>Responses to this Notice must be submitted no later than 2:00 p.m. ET on July 29, 2011 and must be submitted electronically to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov, Attn: RFI-BPD-11-0059 WP/MC.</p>

All eligible business' responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below services upon receipt of order.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize yourself with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>Background<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Branch, developed cell lines from patients with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a devastating lung disease of women. The cell lines developed are being used to understand the pathogenesis of this disease. A critical aspect for the understanding of the disease is to obtain information about the cells gene expression when treated with estrogen. We are also interested on determining the role of mutations in the tumor suppressor gene (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2) because it affects development of Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) which is a disease studied in this laboratory. This aspect is important because of the prevalence of LAM in women. We have studied many candidate genes involved in LAM but we can not get a full understanding of the disease. Thus, we would prefer to obtain a more global idea of the gene expression changes of these cells. Therefore, we would need to carry out gene expression profiles of cells non-treated or treated with estrogen. These experiments are essential for the goals of the branch.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:<br />The main of objective of this requirement is to carry out gene expression profiles that would allow us to obtain data that will tell us differences of the genes present in each sample when treated with estrogens. The work will involve following services on the below samples: <br />-Isolation of RNA from cells cultured in vitro. <br />-Labeling of the RNA <br />-Analysis of the molecules</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Processing 40 Human samples on Illumina HT-12 beads arrays<br />2. Processing 48 18 mouse samples on Illumina WG-6 beads arrays<br />3. Processing 48 human samples on Illumina HT-12 beads arrays <br />4. Processing 24 mouse samples on Illumina WG-6 beads arrays <br />The Government's estimated delivery time is 6 weeks from the time of sample shipment.</p>

<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, Protected Resources Division in St. Petersburg, FL intends to award a Purchase Order to the Columbus Zological Park Association, Powell, OH for the operation of an acroporid rearing facility at the Caribbean Marine Bological Institute (CARMABI), Curacao, Netherlands Antilles
<p>Objectives: <br />-Operate an acroporid field, land-based culture facility (nursery) at the Curacao Sea Aquarium, Curacao, Netherlands Antilles <br />-Rear Elkhorn coral recruits from field collected gametes in Curacao in nursery<br />-Re-introduction of recruits for research and restoration purposes</p>
<p>SECORE is an international, independent partnership of more than 50 institutions dedicated to nature conservation through the development of sexual coral breeding plans and the sustainable management of coral reefs. The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium (CZA)is the SECORE member institution responsible for financial facilitation for the partnership. As such, CZA is the only institution through which funds can be transferred to support the partnership's projects. Further, SECORE is, to our knowledge, are the only institutions that have successfully and repeatedly reared acroporid corals from larvae in aquaria. The methods they utilize to collect and rear the corals are proprietary.</p>
<p>Elkhorn and staghorn corals were listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in May 2006. In critical habitat designation for the species in November 2008, we determined the key conservation objective for the listed acroporids is the facilitation of sexual and asexual reproduction. SECORE is directly addressing this key conservation objective through their projects focusing on the development of sustainable techniques for the sexual reproduction of elkhorn coral. SECORE has the following objectives:<br />(1) establishing a field protocol for restoring acroporid corals;<br />(2) studying sexual coral reproduction;<br />(3) developing ex situ breeding techniques; <br />(4) disseminating techniques among the aquarium and research community through workshops and publications; <br />(5) developing an international network of public aquariums and research institutions to enhance co-operation; and <br />(6) establishing breeding programs to sustain ex situ and field populations.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of these objectives will directly support the recovery of listed acroporid corals through the facilitation of sexual and asexual reproduction. Within the past three years, SECORE has successfully raised larvae and juveniles under aquarium conditions. A critical need exists to establish to our knowledge gained in aquaria to field conditions for establishing a protocol for restoring the natural population of the listed acroporid coral throughout its geographic range - the Caribbean.</p>
<p>MINIMUM TASKS REQUIRED:</p>
<p>Task 1: Operation and maintenance of coral nursery for 12 months.</p>

This is a notice of intent to go Sol Source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for the following items:
Use of The Nature Conservancy Facility's on Palmyra Atoll
Vendor:
Nature Conservancy, The4245 North Fairfax Dr. Ste. 100Arlington, VA 22203-1637

The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is the proprietor of the only research facility on Palmyra Atoll, an inholding in Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge (NWR).  When the Pacific Reefs NWR Complex Fish and Wildlife Services (FWS) personnel are on Palmyra the must use the TNC Facility while on-island as there is no alternative selection.  The atoll is uninhabited, except for the camp that is run by TNC for the Palmyra Atoll Research Consortium that is dedicated to educational research.  The service manages remote camps on other atoll NWR's and the cost are well known to the Service.  While at the atoll, FWS personnel are in temporary duty status and it is more cost effective and operationally feasible for the government to use the TNC facility than it would be to establish a separate remote field camp on the Atoll.

Thus, WHV is the only available firm who can provide the professional services to complete the work as specified.
This is not a request for competitive proposals. Firms believing that they can provide these services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer at kmurray@usgs.gov.

<DESC>Statement of Work (SOW) Multimode plate reader
<p>52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal<br /><br />***Please ensure your quote is valid through September 30, 2011***<br /><br />Part I: General Information<br />A. Introduction<br />Procurement of multifunctional plate reader for quantitative analysis of functional antibodies and protein:protein interactions<br /><br />B. Background<br />Presently we rely heavily on the use of an older model plate reader Victor X. This plate reader is used on a daily basis by our lab as well as others to generate data critical to our mission within the Division of Viral Products. At this point the Victor X has become dated and we require an update to this instrument to keep up with changing technologies. <br />Influenza virus is a major human pathogen that causes morbidity and mortality each year in the United States. The Division of Viral Products at CBER has traditionally facilitated the manufacture of seasonal flu vaccines. With the pandemic threats there is also a need for CBER to support pandemic vaccine production. Technology to accurately quantify protein interactions (antibody/antigen) and binding avidity is an essential tool to evaluate immune responses to vaccines. A range of technologies are used, depending on the level of sensitivity needed, the substrates at hand, and validated protocols. We currently use photometry to measure antibody responses to antigens, fluorometry and luminescence to measure neuraminidase activity of influenza and will need to use a label-free method to determine binding avidity of virus to cells or antibodies to antigen. <br /><br />C. Scope<br />Our objective is to obtain a multimode plate reader capable of measuring the following outputs: absorbance, fluorescence, luminescence, label-free interactions with cells, label-free protein:protein (biochemical) interactions. The plate-reader will be used for important regulatory-based research projects.</p>
<p>Part II: Work Requirements</p>
<p>A. Technical Requirements<br />1. Benchtop instrument with multiple read-out technologies, to include photometry, luminometry, fluorometry, as well as label-free technology<br />2. Must have plate stacking capabilities (at least 20 plates per stack)<br />3. Must have at least 2 automatic injectors<br />4. The label-free technology should have capacity to perform cell-based assays as well as measure biochemical interactions<br />5. The instrument must have integrated full scale computer with software including IC50/EC50, linreg, spline, 4PL/5PL curve fitting capabilities, concentration calculations, flexible report formatting and automatic data export; Full size touch screen software interface is beneficial<br />6. The instrument must be capable of reading either 96-well or 384 well plate formats<br />7. Will be advantageous to include Alpha Technology capability with optimized laser excitation and plate cooling feature to ensure maximum sensitivity (&lt;100 amol) and throughput, as well as pre-programmed and validated AlphaLISA assay protocols<br />8. Should have high performance quad monochromator with 5nm bandwidth on both excitation and emission for maximum precision.<br />9. The instrument must include injectors</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Installation and Training<br />&bull; Components should be installed to meet specifications as written in bid response and must be met after any service visits<br />&bull; On-site training should be complete within 6 weeks of instrument delivery</p>
<p>3. Warranty<br />&bull; Shall include 1 year extended warranty or base (one year from date of delivery/installation) for all components and software. <br />&bull; Shall include 4 additional years extended warranty or base (after the initial year warranty) for all components and software listed as follows:<br />Option 1<br />Option 2<br />Option 3<br />Option 4</p>
<p><br />B. Deliverables<br />Contractor shall deliver and install to specifications, set up analytical software and provide warranty and training in instrumentation and analysis.</p>
<p><br />Part III: Supporting Information</p>
<p>A. Security<br />Contractor shall pass through NIH Main Campus (Bethesda) security for access to NIH Campus and deliver to 29 Lincoln Drive, Building 29A loading dock, Bethesda, MD 20892</p>
<p>B. Place of Performance<br />Deliver to:<br />Attn: Katie Harris <br />29 Lincoln Drive<br />Bldg. 29A Rm. 1D24 (via loading dock)<br />Bethesda, MD 20892<br />301-402-3846</p>
<p><br />C. Period of Performance<br />Delivery shall occur 30-60 days from date of award.</p>
<p><br />Part IV: Evaluation Criteria<br />&bull; Meets all technical performance requirements<br />&bull; Price/ Best Value</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request For Proposals No. JT0611-29<br />Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory<br />Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)-2nd Campus</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), which is operated under a Prime Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), intends to subcontract for professional planning services for the creation of a Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) and accompanying Design Guidelines for a proposed 2nd UC LBNL Campus. <br /><br />The University seeks to develop a second UC LBNL campus with the potential for approximately 2 million gross square feet (GSF) of research and development facilities to accelerate its pace of innovation, technology transfer, and commercialization; creating high quality jobs in the process. The new campus would consolidate up to approximately 480,000 GSF of leased laboratory and office space supported by up to approximately 70,000 GSF of operations space in the first phase of development. Existing programs in leased facilities include Genomics, Life Sciences, and Physical Biosciences. The balance of the development capacity would allow for additional consolidation, growth of existing programs, new initiatives, and co-location with UC Berkeley, other UC programs, and complementary third-party R&amp;D organizations.<br /><br /><strong>A. PROJECT SCOPE SUMMARY <br /></strong>The planning firm will provide services for the creation of a 2nd Campus Long Range Development Plan and accompanying Design Guidelines, as required by the University of California Regents. The 2nd Campus LRDP will provide a land use plan to guide the physical development at the second campus over the next 20 years. The scope and nature of the LRDP will reflect current and projected regional and national scientific priorities, and balance programmatic goals, support needs, environmental character of the site, and harmonious integration with the surrounding community. The evolution of these priorities over time will drive a corresponding change in the actual development that will occur at the 2nd Campus.</p>
<p>To maximize the 2nd Campus responsiveness to evolving national priorities, the LRDP will provide a general land use plan and development framework to guide the siting of new facilities and infrastructure. The Plan will not commit the University to any specific project. The LRDP will provide Laboratory management, facilities staff, and the UC Regents with decision making guidance for future projects. It will be a highly visible document, that to be effective, must be concise, compelling, and useful to a wide range of readers: The Regents, UCOP officials, Department of Energy, LBNL management, planning staff, as well as local citizens, and city officials.</p>
<p>The 2nd Campus location has not been determined at the time of this RFP, but a preferred site will be identified by the time of award of this subcontract. The LRDP will be written for the preferred site.</p>
<p><strong>B. SCOPE OF SERVICES<br /></strong>The work includes, but is not limited to, providing professional planning services, technical writing, graphic design, and document production needed to complete the LRDP in a timely manner. The following items will comprise the 2nd Campus LRDP:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; Introduction and background<br />&bull; Scientific vision <br />&bull; Space and population projections<br />&bull; Site and facilities existing conditions and future vision <br />&bull; Land use designation zones<br />&bull; Motor vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian circulation; parking, and transit&nbsp; connections<br />&bull; Open space, landscape, and wayfinding<br />&bull; Utilities and infrastructure<br />&bull; Appendices as needed for data completion<br />&bull; Accompanying Design Guidelines<br /><br /><strong>C. PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE<br /></strong>The University will conduct a mandatory pre-proposal conference on-site at LBNL July 18, 2011 from 08:00 to 10:00. The Pre-proposal conference will be held at LBNL Building 15, Room 253. LBNL will present additional information about the project which should be of interest to all Offerors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Offerors should contact Ms. Erin Beardsley via email at EEBeardsley@lbl.gov or phone (510) 486-7877 to arrange for bus transportation and a visitor pass. Parking onsite at LBNL is very limited due to ongoing construction projects. The University will provide bus transportation from the Lawrence Hall of Science main entrance to LBNL Building 15.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See http://lawrencehallofscience.org/visit/hours_cost_location/driving_directions for directions to the Lawrence Hall of Science. The LBNL bus will depart the main entrance Lawrence Hall of Science @ 07:30 and 07:50.</p>
<p><strong>D. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS<br /></strong>All forms, a proposal instructions memo and a Sample Subcontract can be found at http://facilitiesprojects.lbl.gov/</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br /></strong>The LBNL main site LRDP may be reviewed as an example: http://www.lbl.gov/Community/LRDP. The University does not guarantee that any subcontract will be awarded as a result of this announcement and reserves the right to award a subcontract for only a portion of the work described.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Proposals must be received no later than 3:00 PM (PST), August 19, 2011 Proposals that are received after the time and date specified may be rejected. Fax copies of proposals will not be considered. Proposals should be addressed to:</p>

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-52.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intend to procure on a sole source basis with Columbus Instruments Intl Corp., 950 North Hague Avenue  Columbus, OH 43204 the following instrument and components:1.	Upgrade Oxymax 070500/07504/080471/090304 w/Food Mass Monitoring and Telemetry to comprise of the following:
a.	P/N: CLAMS-FM-8-UP --- CLAMS 8 Station Food Mass Monitor Upgrade  QUANTITY (1) EAb.	P/N: CLAMS-CFU-M  --- CLAMS Center Feeder Upgrade to Oxymax Chamber for Mouse (25-50g)  QUANTITY (8) EAc.	P/N: CLAMS-TR-8 --- CLAMS 8 Station Telemetry Receiver and Antenna  QUANTITY (1) EA	d.	P/N: CLAMS-TT ---  CLAMS Telemetry Transmitter for Temperature (only)  QUANTITY (8) EAe.

Oxymax/CLAMS is the only product that provides a one test solution for the simultaneous collection of multiple parameters describing metabolic and behavior performance of up to 32 animals.  Oxymax/CLAMS is ideal for use as the center piece in a phenotyping core facility or when employed within a more focused project where reliable and repeatable data must be collected across a broad range of physiology/behavior  and compared over long periods of time. Such system is currently present at our animal phenotyping core facility and it is able to monitor metabolic and activity parameters in 8 animals at a time. In order to expand the data collected from each mouse at the same experimental paradigm, an upgrade to include food intake and temperature monitoring is required. Upgrading of the lab existing system will allow the lab to get metabolic, behavior and temperature analyses using only one system.  The lab current system is a product of Columbus Instrument, thus it is logical to use the upgrade offers by Columbus thus ensuring that compatibility with the existing equipment.

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK 6/30/2011<br />Requisition Number # NCNM7300-11-02765<br />Exhibiting Maritime Heritage Connections: The development and construction of a modular Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument Maritime Heritage themed exhibit for display at select ONMS and partner host sites</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a United States Federal agency dedicated to understanding and predicting changes in the Earth's environment and to conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet Unites States economic, social, and environmental needs. NOAA is the steward of national coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine protected areas as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species.</p>
<p>The Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS), established in 1972 by the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) and administered by NOAA, protects a network of 13 special marine and freshwater areas. The goal of the NMSA is to set aside and manage areas for resource protection, research, enhanced public education, and compatible public and private uses. Management activities for each sanctuary are detailed in site-specific management plans which outline regulatory goals, describe boundaries, and identify staffing and budget needs, set priorities and performance measures for resource protection, research, and education programs.</p>
<p>In 2001, NOAA initiated a process to consider designating the waters surrounding the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) as a National Marine Sanctuary. On June 15, 2006, George Bush established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (Monument) by Proclamation 8031 to ensure the comprehensive, strong, and lasting protection of the coral reef ecosystem and related marine resources and species of the region. These waters contain a large portion of all coral reefs found in the United States' jurisdiction and support more than 7,000 marine species, of which one quarter are unique to the Hawaiian Islands chain. The 1200-mile stretch of remote islands, atolls and reefs, is also the most remote archipelago in the world.</p>
<p>At a time when ocean resources around the world are in major decline, the designation of the Monument enabled nearly 140,000 square miles of the region to receive the highest form of marine environmental protection in the United States, creating the largest protected marine area in the world.</p>
<p>Project Description</p>
<p>In February of 2010, a new exhibit opened at the Monument's Mokupapapa Discovery Center in Hilo, Hawaii dedicated to the interpretation of the Monument's Maritime Heritage. A large wall space in the program room is devoted to the Lost on a Reef exhibit. This exhibit helps to look more closely into the maritime heritage of the Monument including the history of the USS Saginaw, using the ship's bell (15" x 14") and sounding lead (5" x 3") recovered from the site, as well as other objects and large photos to tell the story of their last mission, and then stranding on Kure Atoll. The exhibit tells the story of whaling ships that sailed through the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands in the early 19th century with the aid of a ship's bell (18" x 30") recovered from the American whaling ship Parker lost at Kure Atoll in 1842. And finally, the exhibit describes the history of shipwrecks in the Monument with a map, depicting the location of discovered shipwreck sites. The material culture from these shipwreck sites, along with other objects that are on loan from partner institutions including a whaling harpoon, a dive helmet, and a sextant, aid in telling the stories of the early seafarers who passed through the Monument hundreds of years ago. A maritime heritage themed interactive display compliments this exhibit and elaborates on the topics discussed in the wall panels.</p>
<p>The proposed Maritime Heritage modular exhibit will be based upon the Lost on a Reef exhibit created for display at the PMNM's Mokupapapa Discovery Center. The exhibit will tell the story of maritime heritage in the Monument along with the broader story of natural and cultural resource protection and preservation in the remote atolls of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). The exhibit will be exhibited at different host sites in the Sanctuary System (such as Thunder Bay NMS) and partner sites (such as Mariner's Museum, NC and VA Aquariums, etc.). Additionally, the exhibit should have the potential to be displayed at potential display spaces in Hawai'i such as Whaler's Village in Maui, the Lahaina Courthouse, and potentially the Bishop Museum in Honolulu.</p>
<p>Through the use of interpretive panels and an interactive display, the exhibit will be modular and easily updatable. The computer interactive from the Lost on a Reef exhibit will be duplicated and packaged to travel for the proposed exhibit. The display will allow visitors to view a variety of topics such as shipwreck and survival camp stories in the remote atolls of the NWHI, maps and images of shipwreck sites, seafaring stories and activities of maritime archaeologists in the field, in addition there will be information about broader PMNM and ONMS efforts. Exhibit content will also focus upon the links between Sanctuary sites and maritime heritage stories that make connections.</p>
<p>In addition to the interactive display which will include video, the exhibit should also include an audio component that will use environmental sounds as well as instrumental slack key and an oli (chant) to add to the atmosphere of the exhibit.</p>
<p><br />In February of 2011, Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument Maritime Heritage Program staff announced the identity of a previously unidentified whaling shipwreck at French Frigate Shoals: the Two Brothers. This rare archaeological discovery is the first discovery of a wrecked whaling ship from Nantucket, Massachusetts, the birthplace of America's whaling industry. Two Brothers was captained by George Pollard Jr., whose previous Nantucket whaling vessel, Essex, was rammed and sunk by a whale in the South Pacific, resulting in inspiration for Herman Meliville's famous book, Moby-Dick. Pollard gained national notoriety after the Essex sinking, when he and a handful of his crew resorted to cannibalism in order to survive their prolonged ordeal drifting on the open ocean. The exhibit will also tell the story of the Two Brothers shipwreck site, a Nantucket whaling ship discovered at French Frigate Shoals. The exhibit will have the potential to incorporate artifacts recovered from the Two Brothers site as well as artifacts currently curated at Mokupapapa Discovery Center. To date, maritime archaeologists have recovered eight artifacts from the shipwreck site ranging from 6 inch long whaling harpoon tips to a 60cm x 60cm cast iron cooking pot. These artifacts, if appropriate, may be included in the exhibit. It may be determined that it is more appropriate to display replicas, to avoid issues with curation of original artifacts.</p>
<p>This project aims to contribute to broader ONMS education and outreach goals, and bring a very remote and largely inaccessible place within the ONMS system (PMNM) to a geographically diverse audience. The goal of this project will be to highlight links between Sanctuary sites through maritime heritage. Through engagement with the public, PMNM and ONMS maritime heritage efforts will reach a broad audience and diverse communities.</p>
<p><br />Scope of Work</p>
<p>Contractor will design, develop, construct and deliver casing, interpretive signage and any other necessary materials for the modular PMNM maritime heritage exhibit based upon the look and feel of the Lost on a Reef exhibit. Contractor will construct an exhibit that can easily be shipped and displayed to partner host sites. Contractor is responsible for building and producing the shipping container and any associated materials needed for the finished product to be shipped to exhibit locations. This includes crates, packing material and any other associated shipping material necessary for safe and simple transport.</p>
<p>Exhibit size will be approximately 15-20 linear feet, arranged one way, and 10 feet by 10 feet arranged another. The exhibit should be designed to facilitate the possibility of wall mounting or free standing panels and small cases, as host sites may have different preferences. Exhibit should include video and audio components. Video components include the duplicated interactive display from the Lost on a Reef exhibit as well as sound equipment.</p>
<p>Development and creation of the modular maritime heritage exhibit will be done in close collaboration with the Monument maritime archaeologist. Vendor should have experience working in Hawaii and creating exhibits that include components of Hawaiian language and culture.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.
ALL QUOTES WILL BE ACCEPTED IF RECEIVED NLT JULY 15TH, 2011 COB EST.
AWARD WILL BE MADE ON OR ABOUT JULY 18TH, 2011.

<p>(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). <br />(The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

Accordingly, while on Offutt AFB, operators and passengers must wear restraints and may be ticketed by Offutt security personnel for failure to comply. In addition, the following administrative penalties, as a minimum, will be imposed on drivers who are cited for speeding 10 mph - 15 mph over base housing posted speed limits: the first offense will result in the issuance of a 7-day driving suspension and the individual's traffic history being assessed points.

The wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices (except for hands-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited (DoD Joint Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision Regulation, paragraph 4-2). Using a cell phone while driving, without a hands free device will be considered a "primary offense", meaning that violators are subject to being stopped and ticketed solely for this offense and the individual's traffic history on Offutt AFB being assessed points for the first offense. Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on your ability to perform your contract.</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers Received to Assist in Preparations of Quote:<br /><br />1. On fedbizopps, the response date lists is 7 July 2011 at 5pm EST, however, the SF 1449 indicates that the offer due date is 6 July 2011 at 4pm EST. Which date and time is the correct deadline?
<p>Answer - 7 July 2011</p>
<p>2. Is the customer only accepting hard copy proposals or may we submit our proposal electronically?</p>
<p>Answer: Electronically is fine, submission must be made to BohacMJ@state.gov and SanchezVJ@state.gov</p>
<p>3. Will the participants be the same for both courses? That is, will the students who take the Intro course also take the Advanced course, or will the Advanced students be a separate group of students who have not taken the Intro course?</p>
<p>Answer: No. At times, the attendees from the Intro course may then take the Advanced course. However, there are individuals who have taken previous introductory courses that will be permitted to take the advanced course without attendance in this particular intro course.</p>
<p>4. In Section 4. Delivery Schedule, the RFP indicates a minimum requirement for the Intro course. Is their a minimum requirement for the Advanced course?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, some sort of foundational basis and attendance in an Introductory analytic course.</p>
<p>5. Section 2.A. Instructor Requirements specifies that there should be two instructors for the course. Is this per course or total? For example, could two instructors teach the Intro Course and a different two instructors teach the Advanced course? Could it be one instructor per course? Or is the expectation that two instructors will teach both courses together? Lastly, does this include guest speakers?</p>
<p>Answer: The requirement is for two instructors per course. The preference would be for the same instructors to facilitate both the Intro and Advanced courses. The proposal had included guest speaker.</p>
<p>**END OF Q&amp;A** No Further Questions and Answers have been offered, please consider the above before responding to ensure your firm understands the requirements as stated.</p>

The OCC has a need for consumer compliance quick reference guides to supplement its Basic Consumer Compliance course which provides training to OCC bank examiners on the practical application of the compliance regulations. Quick reference guides would serve as reference on compliance regulations when examiners complete a community bank compliance exam. Although the primary need is directed towards course participants, the guides would be useful for examiners desiring quick reference to regulations when completing a compliance exam and identifying violations. Having electronic reference guides that are easily updatable is also an important consideration given the ever-changing Consumer Compliance Regulatory environment. <br /><br />For a more detailed description of the requirements, please see the attachment to this posting.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />

<DESC>This extends proposal due date for this previously announced requirement to July 12, 2011 at 3:00 PM PST.
Original announcement can be found below:
SOURCES SOUGHT The USFWS has a requirement to Provide Remote Electrical Power for the Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, Calipatria, CA (Imperial County).  Interested contractors will provide a Performance Work Statement that will describe how the objectives listed below will be reached.  
A Performance Work Statement (PWS) should be provided by July 6, 2011 at 3:00 PM PST.  This PWS can be written in narrative form and should be a detailed desription of how the work should be performed.  Proposals will be ranked based on proposed methodology.  Price to be negotiated with the contractor that provides the best overall proposal.  If a fair and reasonable price cannot be reached through negotiation, USFWS will enter into negotiations with the second ranked contractor and so on until a fair and reasonable price is reached.  The PWS should be submitted to Shannon Blackburn by Fax to (503) 231-6159 or by email to shannon_blackburn@fws.gov.
Possible NAICS codes for the proposed work include:221119 - Electric Power Generation237130 - Alternative Energy Generation238210 - Electrical Contractors541330 - Electrical Engineering Services
All technical questions are to be directed to Chris Schoneman at (760) 348-5278, x227 and contractual questions to Shannon Blackburn at (503) 872-2825.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  Performance Work Statement should meet the requirements for the following Statement of Objectives.
I.	Purpose:
Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR needs electrical power at a remote site where there is no power supply. The electricity is needed to power two water pumps, each with a power requirement of 3 phase, 220 volt, 7.5 HP.

II. 	Scope or Mission:
In addition to the basic electrical requirement to electrify pumps for moving water, the intent of this project is to accomplish this project using solar technology, either with Stirling Engine generators or Organic Rankine Cycle turbine generators, or similar technology. The location of the project site is in one of the hottest regions of the United States, making the potential for solar power generation very feasible. The site is at the southeast shore of the Salton Sea in Imperial County, California where a habitat restoration project is being planned.  No city quality water is available at the site so water for cleaning will need to be hauled as needed. The closest site of this quality water is at the refuge maintenance yard 1.5 miles away. 
III.	Period and Place of Performance;
Electrical supply is expected to be needed by Dec 31, 2013. The electrical supply will be needed near Red Hill Bay, approximately 1 mile northeast of the Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR headquarters office. Access to the site will either be from Garst Rd. or Red Hill Marina County Park.

IV. 	Background:
This project is part of an attempt to restore wetland bird habitat of the Salton Sea, an area of extremely high migratory bird value and use. Project planners intend to use screw pump technology to lift water uphill from the current shoreline of the Salton Sea to blend with upstream fresher water, keeping the current shoreline of the Salton Sea wet. A screw pump manufacturer has estimated that we would need a single 36 inch screw pump running at 50 rpm 24 hrs/day to lift 5 cfs of water 6 feet, plus another single pump for standby. Because we are requesting a solar source of electricity, we are increasing the estimated number of pumps to 2 considering they would only be running during daylight hours.  The Salton Sea is drying out and its wildlife habitat values are diminishing. Because the Salton Sea is drying out the site can be very dusty, sometimes the dust is high in salts which may be corrosive. This fact and considering the technologies requested are generally more efficient at generating power, we are not requesting Photovoltaic electricity. Developing an alternative source of electricity is good for a variety of reasons: 1, Electricity is needed. 2, abundant sunshine/heat is available most of the year. 3, for the comparative cost of routing powerlines to the site, it is probably more efficient to develop a solar source of power. And 4, using a solar technology blend well with the environmental stewardship concept of habitat maintenance. Additionally there is a potential need for solar derived electricity at other potential habitat restoration sites around the Salton Sea in a modular style if perfected and demonstrated well.
No construction has begun yet. The project is being planned and environmental documentation prepared. These two parts of the project are expected to be complete by Dec. 31 2012.

V. 	Performance Objectives:
1.	Generate 3 phase, 220 volt electricity sufficient to operate two 7.5 HP motors.  
2.	Electricity needs to be solar generated power.
3.	Solar generators can not depend on a continuous supply of fresh water for cleaning, cooling etc.
4.	The system must perform during daylight hours of every sunny day of the year. The system should be low maintenance to operate, other than occasional cleaning and scheduled maintenance (no more than weekly attention).
5.	Replacement parts for all aspects of the generating system must be commercially available or easily machined at a local machine shop. The vendor must be able to provide a separate first year on-call Service agreement with a response time of no more than 48 hours after a service request. Depending on the complexity of the system and the refuge's ability to perform independent future generator maintenance, engineered drawings may be requested of the vendor sufficient for a qualified electrician to make repairs to any part of the system or build a new unit if necessary. Vendors not able to provide drawings and schematics upon request are not eligible to respond to this request for proposals.
6.	A security fence will be needed. Either a temporary fence can be installed to secure the site during construction by the vendor and a permanent fence installed afterward by the Government, or a permanent fence installed by the vendor. This part can be negotiated.

VI.	Operating Constraints:
The site where electricity is needed is on silty deposits of a lakebed. Some site preparation will be required before installation begins. Area for reflectors, dishes or concentrators is essentially not limited.
The project site is in Imperial County, California, a rural county with farming as a primary industry. Parts and supplies to build or maintain a newer technology may not be available locally. 
The government does not have dedicated staff to operate a power generating facility on a daily basis. Therefore it is imperative that the provided technology be relatively low maintenance.

Once you hit Darkhorse Lake approximately 5 miles up, continue on west of the lake, and hike up to the divide. This puts you in the middle of the project.

<DESC>Date for receipt of responses has been extended to 07/18/2011. No other changes were made to this notice. <br /><br />Concerning Proposed Change to SFLC cutter repair availability specifications
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) in accordance with FAR Part 10, Market Research. This part prescribes policies and procedures for conducting market research to arrive at the most suitable approach to acquiring, distributing, and supporting supplies and services. This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning, and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.</p>
<p>Information received in response to this RFI will be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 15.207(b); nevertheless, submitters must properly mark their response if it contains information the submitter does not want disclosed to the public for any purpose. If sources elect to submit competition-sensitive or proprietary information, sources bear sole responsibility for marking said information as such to ensure appropriate safeguarding by the Government. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.<br />Interested parties are encouraged to submit the requested information to Kathryn Stark at Kathryn.e.stark@uscg.mil by COB EST 5 July 2011. If additional information is required to formulate your response to this RFI, request the information through the POC listed above.</p>
<p>Background: Modernization, technical advances, and increased USCG cutter connectivity demands have dramatically impacted our ability to successfully support our assets during dry dock periods. Emergency dry dock periods and shipyard availabilities distant from a cutter homeport weaken already challenging process requirements and security demands. Prior to modernization, providing CGDN+ connectivity to assets in commercial shipyards varied based on a number of factors, including the geographic location of the shipyard, availability of internet connectivity, the local understanding of security requirements, and the availability and source of funding. While multiple technical solutions to provide CGOne connectivity remain available, the Coast Guard seeks to establish a minimum requirement for all assets during dry dock periods.</p>
<p>This RFI seeks industry comments to assist the Government in (1) Improving the Government's understanding of industry capabilities (2) Identifying sources capable of providing these critical services in support of USCG SFLC ship repair availabilities</p>
<p>Capabilities Sought:</p>
<p>Contractor activities shall be conducted at contractor facilities. No government-furnished equipment will be provided to the contractor for use in the contractor's facility.</p>
<p>3.3.2 Broadband. Provide Standard Broadband internet connectivity, distinct from any existing broadband internet connectivity the shipyard may already utilize. Broadband connectivity shall have a download speed of at least 4 Mbps and an interface modem or router that provides a DHCP interface and a 100BaseT Ethernet connection to customer's equipment. Coast Guard technicians must be afforded access during normal business hours to the interface modem or router to establish/troubleshoot/disestablish connectivity for the vessel.</p>
<p><br />Requested Information</p>
<p>Interested parties of any size can submit a capability statement that details their corporate capabilities and experience in performing similar tasks as outlined above. Within this capability statement, vendors must detail relevant, recent experience. In addition to the above, interested parties are required to provide, at a minimum, the following information within the capability statement:</p>
<p>Company Name<br />DUNS Number<br />NAIC Codes<br />Business Size Per Code<br />Address<br />Point of Contact (Name, Email, Phone Number)</p>
<p>1) Do you currently provide Standard Broadband internet connectivity to your customers during shiprepair availabilities, distinct from any existing broadband internet connectivity your shipyard may already use?</p>
<p>2) Does the broadband connectivity your company provides have a download speed of at least 4 Mbps, an interface modem or router that provides a DHCP interface and a 100BaseT Ethernet connection that can be connected to a customer's equipment?</p>
<p>3) If your company does not currently provide Standard Broadband internet connectivity to your customers during shiprepair availabilities, distinct from any existing broadband internet connectivity your shipyard may already use, provide an explanation of whether your company has the capability and capacity to conform to this standard.</p>
<p>4) If your company does not currently have broadband connectivity with a download speed of at least 4 Mbps, an interface modem or router that provides a DHCP interface and a 100BaseT Ethernet connection that can be connected to a customer's equipment, provide an explanation of whether your company has the capability to conform to this standard.</p>
<p>5) What limitations do you have if any?</p>
<p>6) If there are additional costs associated with providing these services that your company does not normally incur, please provide an estimated price to implement these services and if there is one, a monthly price to maintain the service. Provide one total for the implementation phase and one total for the monthly service phase. Please label accordingly.</p>
<p><br />Interested companies shall provide responses of no more than 3 pages to Kathryn.e.stark@uscg.mil .</p>

<DESC>MODIFICATION TO PRESOLICITATION NOTICE - Renovate Building 2 for Transitional Residency Program, Minor Project, at the VA Medical Center in Tomah, WI. 

This notification is to inform all interested parties that the anticipated date for issuing the solicitation is now on or about July 18, 2011 with the bid opening on or about August 31, 2011.

Additionally, the following change is made to the presolicitation notice:

"In accordance with the class deviation to 804.1102 Vendor Information Pages (VIP) Database effective October 1, 2010, all SDVOSB and VOSB firms must be verified by the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) prior to receiving an award under the program. If the successful bidder is not listed as verified in the VIP, the CO must contact the bidder and advise the bidder that it has 5 days to submit the verification documentation to CVE. CVE will process the documents and make a verification determination within 21 days of receipt of the documentation. In accordance with FAR 52.204-7, Required Central Contractor Registration, SDVOSB or VOSB firms also must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be eligible to receive an award. Firms may obtain CCR information at http://www.ccr.gov."

"In accordance with the class deviation to 804.1102 Vendor Information Pages (VIP) Database effective October 1, 2010 and with the subsequently passed Public Law 111-275, all SDVOSB and VOSB firms must be verified by the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) prior to receiving an award under the program. If the successful bidder is listed in the VIP database but is not verified, the CO must contact the bidder and advise the bidder that it has 5 days to request that its verification be expedited. CVE will then make a verification determination within 21 days. A firm MUST be currently listed in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) to receive this expedited verification."

<DESC>The ADAPT program is particularly looking to investigate innovative approaches to building ISR systems. For example, how might commercial practices be used to accelerate the development and delivery of ISR systems without burdening the resulting systems with the limitations typically found in the&nbsp;military use of commercial technology (e.g., limitations in performance, security, reliability or assured operation)?
<p>The elements of the ADAPT concept are divided into three areas: A reusable hardware core, reusable software, and sensor-specific applications. The reusable hardware core can leverage low-cost commercial components available at the time of manufacture, enabling it to be refreshed at the rate of commercial technologies. The reusable software encompasses core system software that will provide an operating system and open-source applications that provide functionality common among various ISR implementations. System integrators can leverage the core hardware, software, and application library to develop and field systems to instantiate sensor-specific capabilities through adjunct hardware and software.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:</p>
<p>U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Philips Research Site (PRS), Directed Energy Contracting Division (RDK), 2251 Maxwell Street, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5773.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED:</p>
<p>This action will be awarded as a new cost plus fixed fee contract to Northrop Grumman Space &amp; Mission Systems Corp. (NGS&amp;MSC), One Space Park Blvd, Redondo Beach, CA 90278-1001. The efforts associated with this acquisition provide for the continuation of RDS' (and portions of RDLE) engineering research and support of four integrated solid state laser, when combined, compose the Integrated Solid State Laser Test bed located at Kirtland Air Force Base, NM.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS:</p>
<p>Under this effort, NGS&amp;MSC will continue to provide onsite technical laser research and engineering advancements for a period of performance of 3 years. NGS&amp;MSC will provide technical laser engineering work on four continuous wave and pulse high energy solid state laser platforms located at Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB), NM with a contractual option for one laser system located in Maui, Hawaii. NGS&amp;MSC will provide total system level diagnostic reviews, laser system technical analysis and overall laser system adjustments in order to match various designated research and development experiments and efforts. This also includes adjustments to and calibration of internal optical laser components. Research will be focused on improving the integration with the total laboratory and the internal and external output beam characteristics from each laser system. NGS&amp;MSC holds exclusive technical data rights to key components of these laser systems. The estimated cost for the term of the contract is $1.9M over a 36 month period. Air Force Research and Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) 3600 appropriations are committed and reserved to fund program costs associated with this research expansion.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:</p>
<p>10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY):</p>
<p>A total of four specific laser systems are applicable to the efforts associated with the program. The first, Vesta II laser, was purchased under contract W9113M-05-C-0216. This contract was awarded as a result of a full and open competition under RFP number W9113M-04-R-0013. The other three laser systems, Elektra, Asterope, and Maia, were acquired under contract FA9451-04-C-0158. This contract was awarded as a result of a competitively selected Research and Development proposal received in response to BAA-03-DE-03.</p>
<p>In acquiring these four laser systems, the Government accepted limited data rights as part of the contract terms and conditions. The exclusive technical data rights held by NGS&amp;MSC prevents other companies from working on the internal components of the four laser systems as the design and components are considered NGS&amp;MSC proprietary information.</p>
<p>Specifically, NGS&amp;MSC data rights protect the laser phasing approach, the fiber front end design, the gain modules, mirror designs and coatings. These aspects encompass critical design aspects that need to be understood and accessible to satisfy the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Further, the technical data held by NGS&amp;MSC encompass proprietary information that is essential to understand how these unique systems operate. Key technology methods were developed by NG at private expense and therefore limited data rights were accepted when these systems were purchased by the AF. These data rights protect key specific technical specifications required for equipment and internal modifications to the system.</p>
<p>NGS&amp;MSC and their subsidiaries also manufacture unique equipment that is essential to enable continued operations and research for these laser systems. No other company could produce this unique equipment without access to the NGS&amp;MSC proprietary data.</p>
<p>Award to any other source would result in both a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, as well as result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling Department of Defense solid state laser advancement requirements. Additionally, the four laser systems delivered under the original contracts include developmental processes and limited data rights. The cost to award another contract to develop an alternate specialized laser system with comparable capability is expected to mirror or exceed the original efforts, which are completed, of Contracts W9113M-05-C-0216 and FA9451-04-C-0158, resulting in a 36-month effort and estimated $42M in cost. Delay and expense of this magnitude would seriously degrade AFRL/RDS (and portions of RDLE) optic laser beam research and development activities. Therefore, this acquisition is for continued performance of highly specialized research support.</p>
<p>VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE:</p>
<p>A Sources Sought Synopsis was published on Federal Business Opportunities on 03 Nov 2010. A single response from an 8 (a) party was received. However, upon evaluation of this company's statement of capability submission, the Air Force concluded that the respondent was not technically capable of performing the work requirements of this effort. This assessment was based upon the fact that the respondent did not have access to the proprietary data necessary to progress the research efforts supporting the various solid state lasers (but would have to try and acquire these technical data rights and would eventually need to subcontract more than 85% of the research expansion efforts to NGS&amp;MSC), did not have access to the software source code, would be forced to purchase equipment through NGS&amp;MSC that would exceed 50% of the contract cost, and did not have any knowledge or understanding of these unique solid state laser systems.<br /><br />VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:</p>
<p>Proposal analysis will be accomplished in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii) and FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(vii). The contractor's proposed costs will be carefully examined and verified to the maximum extent possible using material quotes and cost data. Inputs from the AFRL/RDS Program Manager (technical and cost evaluation) and DCAA (verification of direct and indirect rates) will be used to establish a negotiation objective. Weighted Guidelines will be used to determine a fair and reasonable fee. Thus, it is expected the resulting negotiated cost and fixed fee will be found fair and reasonable prior to award of any contract.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:</p>
<p>Market assessment, in this case, has been primarily supported by the results of the Sources Sought Synopsis as described in Section VI above. The market assessment confirms that due to the proprietary nature of the data rights and the limited access to this data, no other company (beyond NG and their subsidiaries) possess the expertise to perform the work on the four solid state laser systems. The market assessment confirmed that any other company, other than NGS&amp;MSC, that is interested in performing this work would need knowledge of the systems (hardware and software) and have to acquire the technical data rights from NGS&amp;MSC to properly meet the requirements of the contract. The market assessment confirmed that no other company has access to the data and/or equipment necessary to fulfill the contract requirements associated with this effort.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:</p>
<p>In reviewing the technical requirements of this project, the primary hurdles that limit these efforts to other than full and open competition are derived from the expertise solely possessed by NGS&amp;MSC and their subsidiaries and the technical data rights affiliated with the technical knowledge, inner workings, and software source code, unique to the four solid state laser systems. NGS&amp;MSC and their subsidiaries possess the data rights, coupled with unique advancements and concepts applicable to the four solid state laser systems, that are key to the continued development of this highly specialized equipment. Any company that would attempt to perform this work would be forced to solicit NGS&amp;MSC for data rights, software source code, and would have to reverse engineer the current systems to become proficient and technically acceptable . The costs associated with implementing such efforts far outweigh any cost or schedule savings that might be recouped via unrestricted full and open competition.</p>
<p><br />X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION:</p>
<p>There were two respondents that expressed an interest in these efforts. <br /><br />XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED:</p>
<p>The AFRL Solid State Laser program has been evolving over the last several decades. With this evolution, it has come to the Air Force's attention that part of the research development of this technology has, through time, unintentionally been relinquished to the various Prime contractors that have supported these research advancements. Consequently, the opportunities to convert these research efforts to a competitive environment have been limited by the ownership of data rights and technological expertise.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION:</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of her knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION:</p>
<p>As evidenced by his signature on the cover page of this document, the technical/ requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is his responsibility, is both accurate and complete.</p>

Justification and Approval
Under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) 
For Restricting Competition under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) "Single Source"


1.	Contracting Activity: 

Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20 Contracting , Supply Team A.  Amanda Glade, Purchasing Agent (208) 429-2019; amanda.glade@va.gov   Requestor:  Boise VA Medical Center, Biomedical Maintenance Service, Jeff Entringer, Point of Contact (208) 422-1594; jeffrey.entringer@va.gov

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: 

This procurement under Purchase Request 531-11-3-5047-0385 for a critical part (Anode High Voltage Transformer for GE Light Speed 16 slice CT with GRE console) to repair our CT scanner, that went down over the Memorial Holiday Week end.  This Anode High Voltage Transformer is required to operate the equipment.  Our CT scanner is Mission Critical to the BVAMC.  If we are not able to obtain this part within the week, there is a very high probability that we will have to send patients out for studies, which will increase expenditures and have a direct impact in patient care.  

3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:

Emergency purchase of a Anode High Voltage Transformer for GE light speed 16 slice CT with GRE console.  Estimated cost of the acquisition is $12,900.00.  This acquisition is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, therefore, in accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(13),  this action will not be advertised.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:

The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The reason for restricting competition for this purchase is based upon the urgent and compelling circumstances of the requirement. The Boise CT scanner is Mission Critical to continued patient care.  If we are not able to obtain this part within the week, there is a very high probability that we will have to send patients out for studies, which will increase expenditures and have a direct impact in patient care.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):

This request is urgent and compelling.  Because we have an existing In-House Assist Service Agreement in place, with the Vendor, we are able to obtain Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts at a 15% discounted rate and parts are in stock and are shipped over-night.  Vendor selected is the Original Equipment Manufacturer for equipment being repaired.  Part/Service is required Urgently to Maintain Continuity of Patient Care, Delivery Time Essential to Patient Care.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104:

Not Applicable:  GE OEM CT Scanner parts only available from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  Use of non-OEM repair parts would conflict with VA260-P-0742 Maintenance Contract (covering services) and might damage critical and expensive components and result in vastly increased repair parts, for which GE could not be held responsible to rectify.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3:

Part cost is determined to be fair and reasonable.  Part offered at best customer catalogue price.  Also, IAW the terms and conditions of VA contract VA260-P-0742, the VA acquires all service parts at a 15% discount off this pricing.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10):

Market research was not conducted by the Biomedical Department because OEM parts are available to the BVAMC from GE at a 15% discounted rate, IAW the Terms and Conditions of VA contract VA260-P-0742.  The OEM was contacted and we determined that the part was in stock, available for immediate shipment and could be shipped overnight in order to maintain an uninterrupted patient schedule, thus maintaining the continuity of patient care.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:

None

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:

GE Healthcare Technologies
OnDemand Services
P.O. Box 4144 (W-503)
Milwaukee, WI 53201

11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required:
\
Not Applicable.  Overwhelming high sunk costs involved with CT Scanner preclude system replacement at this time.  Also, GE maintenance contract indispensable to efficient operation of the scanner, therefore that will not be abandoned in the near term.  For as long as we are dependent upon GE for maintenance we are locked into using OEM parts.

12.	 Requirements Certification - IAW FAR 6.303-2(c):

I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>The contract is required for the construction of modular, relocatable tactical operations centers (TOCs) at various sites in Iraq. The imminent departure of the U.S. military requires the Department of State (DoS) to assume security responsibility for Government personnel in Iraq. These sites&nbsp;will require facilities to house classified systems for monitoring staff movements and gathering security-related intelligence for each of these facilities. No suitable facilities exist in these locations, which meet the project's physical and technical security requirements.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, SAO West, VISN 17 Network Contracting Activity, Dallas VA Medical Center, 4500 South Lancaster Road, Dallas, TX 75216

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  

VISN 17 Network Contracting Activity is seeking approval to solicit utilizing other than full and open competition for sole source, firm fixed price contract for VA North Texas Navi Care Nurse Call Systems.  Hill-Rom is the sole proprietary manufacturer and does not use distributors or sub-license any portion of the product.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:

The requirement is to provide an inpatient Nurse Call System that meets the requisite, as a result of an Inspector General Review entitled Patient Safety Alert to VA Medical Centers, mandating the required a retrofit or replacement of non-conforming beds.  The Hill-Rom Navi Care Nurse Call System enables Dallas VA Medical Center continued standardization that coincides with the "Patient Safety Alert," with the beds presently used.  Additionally, current studies indicate that Staff familiarization with Nurse Call Systems and beds reduces patient care delays.   100% digital audio between patient rooms to the nursing station and to wireless devices, real time audio volume control per room, allowing caregivers to raise or lower the talk/listen volume during the call to adjust to the patient, full duplex audio, allowing patients and caregivers to talk and hear simultaneously without cutting off audio, dual speakers on each audio station, improving sound quality by increasing the projected audio range throughout the patient room, directional microphones, improving reception of the patient's voice and blocking out other room noise, automated patient surveillance and alerts; improved safety protocol compliance, graphical touch screen patient station; easy to use and access information from nurse call, 100% digital Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) audio).  This will reduce patient care delays, increase customer service, reduce training, and provide standardized Nurse Call System. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competitions is 41 U.S.C.253 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 6.302-1 

	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
	Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): 

This equipment is required for safe patient care (i.e. provide routine and emergency communication between patient and staff).  The Hill-Rom Nurse Call System is compatible with all the currently used Versacare, Total Care Beds, Hill-Rom Total Care Beds, Sport Beds and Total Care Bariatric Beds.  It will ensure immediate notification of patient environment or therapy due; exception based alerts: Bed exit alarm, Bed brakes, Bed height, Head & foot rails, dedicated voice path to every patient room.  It has been determined that other manufacturer's beds do not operate properly with the Hill-Rom Nurse Call System.  Hill-Rom is the only manufacturer and sole distributor of the hospital beds that are required for the Dallas VA's 7C Inpatient Care Unit.  The Hill Rom beds are also the only beds that have optimum connectivity to the existing Nurse Call System that Dallas VA currently uses.  No other manufacturer provides the Hill-Rom Nurse Call System.  Further delay will impact patient care.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:

The Dallas VA Medical Center selected Hill Rom Nurse Call System that is compatible with the Hill Rom beds currently in use.  The described items must match the hospital beds currently in use at the Dallas VA Medical Center and only Hill-Rom items can fulfill this requirement. No other company is expected to respond to the requirement.  This system is proprietary and no other vendor is available.  It is neither realistic nor financially responsible to convert to another manufacturer.  Research has indicated that most Nurse Call Systems are proprietary. 

7.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

The anticipated price to the Government is approximately $257,072.00 for Dallas facility.  The list price for this proprietary upgradeis. It is the Contracting Officer's opinion that prices for this procurement will be determined fair and reasonable based on comparison with historical pricing and/or negotiation of prices.  A notice of Intent will be sent to Fed Biz Opps. 

8.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

Market surveys are continually conducted to identify new sources of supply for the Dallas VA. Medical Center; however, only Hill-Rom supplies the described  Navi Care Nurse Call System that is compatible with Hill-Om beds, and with all the additional beds being used by the facilities for both SCI and Hospice unit.  It was determined that only Hill Rom manufactures this unique proprietary system. 

9.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
See Section VI above.

10.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required.

None, there are no other sources available.

11.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

I certify this requirement as outlined in this justification is a bona fide need of the Department Of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data , which forms the basis for this justification, is complete and accurate.

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition
1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8, West Palm Beach Medical Center Medical Administration Service requests sole source procurement for transcription services for medical documents and backup for imaging and pathology reports. Purchase request via 2237 #548-11-4-44110048.
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: This request is for a Sole Source Fixed price contract for Transcription services at the West Palm Beach VAMC.
3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: Transcription services to be provided for medical record documentation of patient care using VA-owned dictation system equipment.
This sole source contract is required to continue service while a long term contract is competitively awarded. Currently, steps are being taken to implement a VISN-wide Transcription Contract for compliance with VHA Directive 2008-042 that mandates one contract per VISN for use by all associated facilities under their jurisdiction. However, this contract will not be effective prior to the expiration of the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center transcription contract, which expires June 30, 2011. Due to the time required to transition to a new vendor, train staff, install equipment and the lengthy procurement process, continuation of this contract is imperative to maintain the existing vendor to prevent delay in patient care. It is estimated to cost $60,000 per six (6) month period with an option to extend six (6) months beginning July 1, 2011.
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:
(X) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
( ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
( ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
( ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
( ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use  of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): Timely access to medical record documentation is critical to the clinical staff's ability to meet the VA's mission of providing quality patient care. Reliable medical transcription services are vital in the support of this endeavor. The VA's computer system (VistA) is complex and somewhat antiquated, which adversely impacts the transition process of a new vendor. In order to ensure a seamless transition with little impact on the care provided veterans, a longer period of time is required to establish standard operating procedures, train staff and vendor, test equipment and
 
software compatibility, install equipment and background checks. Failure to extend the existing contract to provide timely medical record access may result in delay in diagnosis; adversely impact the patient's treatment plan and the provider's ability to make medical decisions, which could create emergent or critical care outcomes vs. routine care. It is expected that conducting the required background checks and training employees on a new system would take approximately 60-90 days. The current contract will expire on 6/30/11. The delay in the implementation of the VISN-wide Transcription Contract has placed us in a vulnerable position. To prevent interruption of service, it is essential to extend our existing contract.
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: A long-term contract is currently being processed for these services.
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and  Reasonable: The contract will be awarded at lower prices than the current rates, which have previously been determined for fair and reasonableness.
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market  Research Was Not Conducted: Sources were sought using GSA Advantage, one response received from one GSA contractor. Notice of Intent was posted on the Government Point of entry FBO.GOV, finding there are multiple interested parties. Interested parties are aware of the long-term contract that is currently being processed for these services. Interested parties are encouraged to compete in the long-term contract.
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: N/A
10.	Listing  of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to  Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: Award of the future VISN-wide Transcription Contract will be open for the normal competition and bids accepted from interested vendors.
12.	Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
