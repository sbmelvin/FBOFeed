The objective of this contract is to increase forage production within deer winter range to achieve the desired forage/cover ratio by securing a complete set of services for performing juniper removal within established juniper stands in the Carr Allotment on national forest land.

The project area contains 11 work units totaling 796 acres.  The stands consist of pole size and old growth juniper. Within units, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the juniper was cut approximately 2 years ago. Woodcutters have been cutting in the area along the main roads. The work is to be performed during a 2 year period.  The locations on the Project Map are approximate and the locations on the ground take precedence over the locations on the Project Map.  

The Contractor shall, considering the specific tasks and sub-tasks involved, develop a plan of operations to accomplish the tasks and sub-tasks, and organize and direct all of the operations and personnel needed to fully accomplish the work. The Contractor shall furnish all technical expertise, labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals necessary to complete the project, except for that which the contract clearly states is to be furnished by the Government.    
 
Included Material within the work units shall be purchased from the Forest Service via a FS-2400-2 Timber Sale Contract.  Upon award of the service contract the Contractor shall execute a 2400-2 Timber Sale Contract and pay one lump sum payment for all Included Material.  Failure to pay for the included material within 30 days may be cause for termination of the service contract. See Exhibit D for a sample 2400-2 Timber Sale Contract if the material is removed as biomass.  See Exhibits C and D for sample 2400-2 Timber Sale Contracts if the material is removed.

<b><u><CENTER>LAND NEEDED</CENTER></u><br><br>
U.S. GOVERNMENT, through the FEMA Group Site Acquisition Process (GSAP)seeks parcels of cleared land for approximately 18,000 temporary housing units for individuals and households displaced from their permanent residences by Hurricane Katrina.<br><br>
REQUIREMENTS:</b><br><br>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Group Site Acquisition Process (GSAP) has a Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps) advertisement for parcels of land.  FEMA is seeking expressions of interest from owners of vacant parcels of land within the Parish of Orleans in Louisiana.  General Services Administration (GSA) will enter into a lease contract on behalf of FEMA with owners whose parcels of land are technically acceptable for the intended use of the Government.<br><br>
The intended use of the leased land is to provide approximately 18,000 temporary housing units to individuals and households displaced from their permanent residences by Hurricane Katrina.   Louisiana Housing Task Force, a division of FEMA, is implementing a federal program to develop and operate temporary housing sites in the referenced Louisiana Parish.  The selected sites will be developed, maintained and operated by qualified contractors.  The Louisiana Housing Task Force Program is a joint state and federally operated plan for temporary housing assistance.  For more information on this program, please contact FEMA Individual Assistance at 1-800-621-FEMA or visit the website at www.fema.gov/rrr/inassist.shtm.<br><br>
FEMA intends to lease only the land that is determined to meet all the governmental technical requirements.  The determination of technical acceptability is made by the GSA Contracting Officer.  The GSA Contracting Officer will use technical criteria provided by FEMA program officials, other federal agencies guidelines and technical contractors who are responsible for construction, operation and maintenance of the sites in making a determination.  The determination process is two-phased.  The first phase will use the criteria listed in this ad to determine if expressions of interest meet the minimum criteria for intended use by the government.  Those persons responding with an expression of interest that meets these minimum criteria will be provided with a Solicitation for Offer (SFO).  The second phase of determination is based upon the additional technical requirements specified within the SFO.  Only the offers that meet all the technical requirements of both this ad and the Solicitation for Offer will be considered for award.<br><br>
Land owners who meet the following minimum criteria are requested to provide expressions of interest to GSA:<br><br>
- Parcels of land no smaller than one tenth (1/10) acre and no larger than 100 acres in size<br>
- Land that is cleared of trees, debris and other impediments to construction<br>
- Land that has direct access from primary/secondary paved roads and with a minimum of 200 feet frontage on these roads<br>
- Land that is not wetlands<br>
- Land that is no further than 200 feet from water, sewerage and electric service<br>
- Land that is no further than 5 miles from schools, food service, and functioning emergency services (medical/police/fire)<br>
- Land that meets local government ordinances, zoning requirements and any other necessary approvals for government intended use<br>
- Land that complies with all necessary environmental, archeological and historical regulations<br><br>
The expression of interest should include as a minimum the following information:<br><br>
1) Owner name, address, phone number, email address if available<br>
2) Written proof of ownership and/or of the legal control necessary to lease the land<br>
3) Description of the land: size, physical characteristics and current use<br>
4) Location of the land: including the physical address, city & parish, and a small map<br>
5) Picture of the site<br>
6) If representing an owner, a written agreement with the owner<br><br>
All expressions of interest shall be addressed as follows and mailed to:<br><br>
<c>General Services Administration<br>
Expression of Interest to FEMA GSAP<br>
3535 S. Sherwood Forest Blvd, Suite 153<br>
Baton Rouge, LA 70816</c><br><br>
Please provide a return address.<br><br>
<b>SOLICITATION PROCESS:</b><br><br>
Typically, GSA will solicit offers from all technically acceptable sites.  Site acceptability will be established by the process of determination described above and within the Solicitation for Offer.  GSA will conduct multiple solicitations for land within Orleans Parish.  These parcels of land must meet the technical requirements that adequately accommodate travel trailers, mobile homes and other types of temporary housing units.  The leasing actions will be awarded to the lowest price technically acceptable offers first.  GSA will continue to solicit offers until the requirement is satisfied. GSA will solicit as many offers as possible for this solicitation period in order to promote competition to the maximum extent practical.<br><br>  
<b>DELINEATED AREA:</b><br><br>
All properties offered to the Government in conjunction with this requirement must be located within Orleans Parish, including the cities and towns located within the geographic area bounded by this parish, in the State of Louisiana.<br><br>
<b>LEASE TERM:</b>  12 to 36 Months.<br><br>
<b>GSA CONTACT:  Lill Clark, 225-757-5326, or via fax at 225-298-5439.</b>

<CONTACT>John E. Lynch 407-380-4197
<DESC>The government is seeking sources for procurement and installation of fifty  (50) target carriages for an existing known distance (KD) rifle range at Camp Hansen in Okinawa, Japan.  KD rifle target carriages are counter-balanced carriages that hold two 72”x72” targets connected by chain and sprocket so that when one is lifted the other is down.  The frames are constructed of wood 2”x2” frame with Coroplast backing attached to a 2”x4” upright.  The carriage is approximately 84” in width, 23” in depth and 84” in height.  They are bolted to an existing concrete pad.  The chain and sprocket must be heavy duty with replaceable links and be made of stainless steel to resist corrosion.  All other steel must be galvanized to resist corrosion from high humidity and salt air.  As this is a manual system, the targets must move with minimal effort and move smoothly even in windy conditions.    Metal to metal contact must be accomplished by neoprene rollers with greaseless bearings!  .  Counter-weights must be included with each carriage to replace one of the targets to allow use of only one target vice two when necessary.  The carriages must be anchored sufficiently to withstand tropical storm winds up to 130 knots. Contract will include removal of existing target lifters. The award will be approximately $100,000 with an anticipated delivery date of 90 days after contract award.   The vendor should supply comments to the documents indicating ability to meet specified requirements, specific items requiring clarification for responsive industry proposal, and specified requirements which un-necessarily drive system procurement or lifecycle cost. Received comments will be considered by the Government for basis of modification to the subject documents. Comments will not be directly responded to but may be addressed collectively at a future date during or prior to solicitation. Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command, PM Training Systems is seeking sources for procurement and installation of pneumatic pistol range target systems at Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center, Bridgeport, CA and Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point NC.  The target systems contain 25 targets Cherry Point and 10 targets at Bridgeport.  Targets will be emplaced approximately 48 inches on center.  The targets must be capable of turning 90 degrees to repeatedly face and face away from the shooter.  The target holders must be designed to hold a standard military “E-type” silhouette (20” x  40”) without modification and be designed using material that will not allow ricochets .  The control system must include a removable control box and must include a “Toughbook” type laptop computer (Mil Std 810F compliant) for automatic operation.  The computer must be fully installed with programmable, “Windows-type” software to operate the targetry according to standard Marine Corps ma!  rksmanship standards.  The operations system must include an air compressor with dryer package to include: a pressure gauge, regulator, filter, an air-cooled after-cooler, and a desiccant dryer assembly.   The Bridgeport installation must include installation of a protective barrier in front of the targets to protect the target mechanism and a small structure to protect the compressor from inclement weather.  Ricochet producing target mechanisms must be below the protective barrier in all cases.  Both ranges have adequate impact barriers or bullet traps behind the targets.  The contract will include removal of existing, obsolete pistol range targetry and equipment. The award will be approximately $50,000 with an anticipated delivery date of 30 days after contract award.  The vendor should supply comments to the documents indicating ability to meet specified requirements, specific items requiring clarification for responsive industry proposal, and specified requirements which un-necessarily drive system procurement or lifecycle cost.

<DESC>The government intends to award on a sole source to EOD Technologies, Inc., 2229 Old Highway 95, Lenoir City TN 37771 for the procurement, delivery and assembly of a total of 24 environmentally friendly steel aviation and armor targets for Camp Pendleton, CA and Camp Lejeune, NC.  Both installations will receive four mock-ups each, replicating a BRDM, BMP and T72 Tank.  These targets, commonly known as “Green Targets,” are unique in the industry and were designed specifically to be helicopter transportable, environmentally friendly and extremely durable to withstand impacts from large caliber weapons.  These targets are made from sheet steel with interlocking slots that fit together to keep it erect and three-dimensional.  They have coatings to give the appearance of the actual vehicle without having any material that is harmful to the environment.  The helicopter transportability reduces the need for explosive ordinance clearing of routes into the target area. The Contractor shall furnish the necessary services, supplies, FOB destination delivery to the bases at MCB Camp Pendleton, CA and MCB Camp Lejeune.  Installation and assembly is required.  Helicopter support may be provided by the government. This award will be approximately $400,000 with the anticipated delivery date of 90 days after contract award.   The Marine Corps reserve the option to purchase additional targets and supplies from EOD Technologies, Inc. for sites aboard other Marine Corps Installations. This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days after publication of this notice, the US Government intends to award a sole source contract to Austin Precision Products, Inc.  No Phone calls will be accepted.

<RESPDATE>083106
<ARCHDATE>07262007
<CONTACT>Luis Maestas Contracting Officer 3032361832     Luis_Maestas@blm.gov;
<DESC>STEWARDSHIP CONTRACT:  The Bureau of Land Management intends to enter into stewardship contract projects with private persons or other public or private entities to perform services to achieve land management goals on approximately 700 acres of public lands that meet local and rural community needs. The purpose of the Two Tail Peak Stewardship Project is to improve and sustain forest health by making the forest stands on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management in the Two Tail Peak area more resilient to insects & disease and reducing the potential for high intensity wildland fires.  Introduction/Background:  This is a Stewardship Contract Project.  Section 347 of Public Law 105-277 (as amended by Section 323 of Public Law 108-7) grants the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service (FS) authority until September 30, 2013, to enter into stewardship contracting projects (stewardship projects) with private persons or public or private entities, by contract or by agreement, to perform services to achieve land management goals for the national forests or public lands that meet local and rural community needs.  The Bureau of Land Management intends to enter into stewardship contract projects with private persons or other public or private entities to perform services to achieve land management goals on approximately 700 acres of public lands that meet local and rural community needs. Scope of Work:  Treatment actions taken under this stewardship contract will reduce both stocking levels, restore species composition to species that are more resistant to fire, insects & disease, and reduce fuel loading of forest fuels.  This will be accomplished by the Contractor identifying leave trees and removing excess trees, diseased trees, trees infested with insects, and dead & dying trees that currently are creating ground and ladder fuels.  Shrubs, brush, and non-merchantable excess trees shall be slashed by the Contractor and the resulting fuels will be either treated by the Contractor mechanically through mastication or prepared for prescribed burning.  Areas, identified by the Government will be reforested by the Contractor with seedlings provided by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall complete road renovation, culvert removal and installation, gate construction and installation, road maintenance, dust abatement, and soil stabilization work.  The Contractor shall also provide additional confer seed to be placed in the BLM's seed bank.     Desired End Result:  The purpose of the Two Tail Peak Stewardship Project is to improve and sustain forest health by making the forest stands on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management in the Two Tail Peak area more resilient to insects & disease and reducing the potential for high intensity wildland fires. Silvicultural treatments would guide these stands toward their historic species mix, stocking levels, and structure and diversity making them more resistant to wildfire and insect/disease attack.  The remaining stand on public lands will be dominated in the future by large diameter long-lived seral species consisting primarily of WL, PP, and DF.  Historically this type of forest structure and composition was maintained by mixed severity wildfire which has been eliminated by fire suppression.  The actions taken under this stewardship contract will protect the timber and natural resources on public and private lands, increase opportunities to suppress wildland fire, reduce the effects of wildland fire to the adjacent private land improvements, and increase the safety of the public and fire fighters during a wildland fire.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, 671 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854 for the development of the DNA methylation data and micro-satellite data modules for the Colon Cancer kNowledge Utility Toolbox (CoCaNUT).  The CDP is supporting the development of a large data set of molecular alterations in colon cancer through a program project, P01 CA065930-08.  One goal of this project is to develop comprehensive data on 600 colon cancers with data being generated by microarray analysis of gene expression,  mutation analysis, array CGH,  microarray based SNP analysis, DNA methylation analysis and micro-satellite instability analysis.  The investigators involved in this project have completed analysis of 300 colon tumors and are generating data on an additional 300 tumors.  The investigators will make all of the data available to the research community through the infrastructure established by NCICB.  They are collaborating with NCICB to use the caBIG tools, caIntegrator and the data base format developed for the brain tumor database, REMBRANT, to integrate their data and make it available through an application called CoCaNUT.  caIntegrator has the data module necessary for handling most of the colon data but lacks modules for DNA methylation data and micro-satellite data.  The Robert Wood Johnson Medical School a contractor under the original project and will develop the DNA methylation data and micro-satellite data modules.  It is critical that these modules be developed and become part of NCICB databases where the data can be obtained and entered by any cancer investigator.  DNA methylation in cancer initiation and progression is being realized and the generation of comprehensive methylation data on tumors is rapidly expanding.  The investigators at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School are the only known source to the NCI Researcher that has both the software development capability, the intimate familiarity with the colon cancer data and the expertise required to develop the data modules required for the CoCaNUT database.  They have large data sets of molecular alterations in colon cancer that no other organizations have on a comparable level and these data sets will be used to test the performance of the data modules as they are being developed.  In addition this contractor is already collaborating with NCICB to make the colon cancer data available to the community using the data modules already developed.  They are in a unique position for developing data modules for the DNA methylation and micro-satellite data that can be effective integrated into caIntegrator.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 7, 2006.

<DESC>The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) intends to negotiate with Duane Morris, on a sole source basis, for the continuation of legal services arising out the Special Examination of Fannie Mae.  The work will be incorporated into the existing contract with Duane Morris because it involves the same issues and evidence, including accounting practices, internal controls and executive compensation, as the firm developed in connection with the examination.  The continuation of these legal services requires the expertise they alone have due to their performance on the current contract; the incumbent contractor is the only contractor sufficiently versed in the issues and facts to perform the services within the time required given the statutory deadlines presented in the matter.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>B--Evaluate Ecosystem Restoration and Management Options for Swan Lake HREP Project
<SOLNBR>W912P9-06-T-7084
<RESPDATE>080706
<ARCHDATE>10062006
<CONTACT>Marilyn Aird, 314-331-8528
<DESC>This is a sole source procurement for Greenbriar Wetland Services of Advance, Missouri.  Dr. Mickey Heitmeyer, of Greenbriar Wetland Services, is uniquely qualified to evaluate ecosystem restoration and management options for the Calhoun and Gilbert Lake Divisions of Two Rivers National Wildlife Refuge.  These divisions encompass the District's completed Swan Lake Habitat Rehabilitation and Enhancement Project (HREP) in Calhoun County, Illinois.  The results of ongoing post-project monitoring have cal led for development of restoration and management options.  In 2005 Dr. Heitmeyer compiled background information needed for development of this evaluation.  With this information he was able to identify the pre-settlement ecosystem condition for these two  divisions, including surface geomorphology, the distribution and extent of historic plant communities, and pre-dam hydrology.  Identification of the pre-settlement ecosystem condition is needed to develop and evaluate restoration and management options. He is the only wetland and aquatic biological consultant to compile and assess this type of information for this geographical area.  If any other biological consultants were to evaluate ecosystem restoration and management options for this area, they would  need additional time to understand this complex site located near the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers.  For example, it would be necessary for them to gain familiarity with 1) the Corps Swan Lake HREP project, 2) the three year plan to evaluate post-project physical and biological responses, 3) results from two plus years of such monitoring, 4) the larger area comprising the Calhoun and Gilbert Lake Divisions, and 5) the kinds of information compiled by Dr. Heitmeyer and used to describe  the pre-settlement ecosystem condition.  The amount of time needed for this additional research would prevent the District from receiving the final report describing restoration and management options by 30 September 2006.  Receipt of the final report by 30 September 2006 will dovetail with the completion of the majority of the 3-year monitoring, and allow the agencies to make a timely and informed decision about the direction of future management of the Swan Lake HREP project.  The estimated dollar amount  is under the Simplified Acquistion Threshold.

<SOLNBR>W912QR-MILCON-COS
<RESPDATE>090406
<ARCHDATE>11032006
<CONTACT>Kim McKnight, (502) 315-6189
<DESC>THIS ADVERTISEMENT CONTAINS A LOT OF INFORMATION; THEREFORE, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. MILITARY CONSTRUCTION (MILCON) CENTERS OF STANDARDIZATION NATIONWIDE PROGRAM INFORMATION:  This is an advance notice concerning the hosting of four regional Industry Day Forums in order to perform market research on Request(s) for Proposal(s) that may be i ssued in support of the Centers of Standardization Military Construction (MILCON) Program.   The Army is undertaking a significant shift in emphasis and prioritization with respect to resources and priorities.  This shift is driven by a reassessment of the strategic and operational environments and the Armys responsibilities to provide relevant a nd ready land power capabilities to commanders as part of the Joint Force now and in the future.  To realize the objectives of the emphasis shift, the Army is pursuing the most comprehensive transformation of its forces since the early years of World War I I.  The transformation is intended to move the legacy force into a new modular, more expeditionary and more lethal entity capable of quickly responding to our nations future threats.  A key component to this initiative is the standing up of Centers of Sta ndardization and standard designs for 41 facility types as described below.  USACE, in achieving the Armys objectives, is requesting market research information to allow responsible Districts to support the acquisition strategy for each facility type.  In order to accomplish this, USACE will conduct four regional Industry Day forums and will implement an internet-based market research questionnaire to gather and provide information regarding the Center of Standardization (CoS) MILCON needs.  This questio nnaire need only be completed one time for the entire MILCON COS Program.  This information will be gathered according to the Armys Installation Management Agencys (IMA) four regions which are: Northeast Region (NER), Northwest Region (NWR), Southeast Re gion (SER), and Southwest Region (SWR).  Please see the market research website for a map of the states covered by each of the IMAs regions.  The market research questionnaire will be available at the following web site: https://ebs.swf.usace.army.mil/ebs /Market_Research/MarketResearchSurveyForm.cfm?ProjectID=1.  This questionnaire will be open for input on August 4, 2006, through September 4, 2006.  The US Army Corps of Engineers will execute projects of all sizes.  Therefore, it is important for Industry  to respond to this market survey and demonstrate its experience relative to each of the facility types.  The results of the survey will help the Government determine Industrys experience and capability to execute the requirements.  As this is a nation-wi de survey, you will only need to complete this survey one time for your interest and capability to be included in our research.  As a result, the acquisition strategies will potentially include both set-aside projects and unrestricted projects.   The targeted industry groups for this survey are traditional construction firms, architect-engineer firms, and contractors that provide non-traditional construction methods, such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized, Tilt-up, and Permanent Modular construction.  This Construction Program will consist of the following facility types: Physical Fitness Facility, Outdoor Sports Facility, Child Development Center  Infant/Toddlers, Child Development Center  School Age, Youth Activity Center, Consolidate d fire, Safety & Security Facility, Fire Station, Army Community Service Center, Bowling Center, Hazardous Material Storage Facility, Close Combat Tactical Trainer, Military Operations Urban Terrain Facility, Training Ranges, Battle Command Training Center , Training Support Center, Army Reserve Center,     Operational Readiness Training Complex (ORTC), General Instruction Building, Classroom, Enlisted Personnel Dinning Facility, Military Entrance Processing Station, Family Housing, I nformation Systems Facility, Criminal Investigation Facility, Religious Facility, Access Control Points, Aviation  Vertical Construction, 4-Star HQ Facility, National Guard Armory, Company Operations Facility, Tactical Equipment Maintenance Facility, Brig ade Operations Complex, Brigade/Battalion HQ: Admin, Command and Control Army (UEy) & Corps (UEx) HQ: Admin/Ops, Deployment Facility, Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (Barracks), Basic Combat Training Complex (BCT) / One Station Unit Trainee (OSUT) , Advanced Individual Training Complex (AIT), General Purpose Warehouse, Central Issue Warehouse, Hospitals, and Medical Facilities (health clinics, dental clinics, and medical clinics) to support the Centers of Standardization Army MILCON requirements.  T his program will be managed by eight centers of standardization.  Scope and reach of individual contracts has not yet been determined. All buildings are to be considered permanent and shall have a life span of approximately 25 years.   THE PROGRAM AS A WHO LE IS NOT RESTRICTED AND IS OPEN TO BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION UNDER NAICS CODES 236  Construction of Buildings (236116, 117, 118, 210, 220); 237  Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction (237110, 120, 130, 210, 990); 238  Specialty Trade Contractors (238110, 120, 130, 140, 210, 220); 541Professional and Technical Services (541310, 320, 330, 410, 490).

A pre-proposal conference and site visit is scheduled for May 2, 2006.  The proposal due date is scheduled for June 2, 2006.

The NAICS Code for the solicitation is 236220.  The size standard is $28,500,000.00.  This is a design build project with a maximum funding limitation of $14,400,000.00.  The estimate performance period for design and construction is 554 days from contract award.

1. PROJECT TITLE:  NSWCCD Detachment Bremerton Consolidation, P-364, Naval Base Kitsap at Bangor, Silverdale, WA

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION.  The project will provide design and construction for a 22,380 square feet (sf) combined laboratory building with 80-100 stall paved parking area, a pier to a Government furnished floating pontoon, two prefabricated buildings (1,000 and 2,000 sf, respectively) on the pontoon, civil site improvements to Carlson Spit, and extension of existing base utilities at Naval Base Kitsap at Bangor for the entire project.  Sustainable design features shall be adhered to for the combined laboratory and when possible, the pier.  Anti-Terrorism Force Protection features are required for all facilities and may include setbacks, Intrusion Detection Systems, and other notable features such as card swipe/electronic keypads.  Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF) rooms and distribution systems are required as part of this project.

3. SITE ANALYSIS.  The site is located on Naval Station Kitsap at Bangor, Bangor Washington.   The project site is located at Carlson Spit south of the Service Pier, on the Hood Canal. Access to the Spit is via Sealion Road to the Service Pier Access Road onto the Access Road. The new pier will be located on the south side of the Spit. The laboratory facility is located at the southeast corner of Sealion and Wahoo Road.  The existing conditions of Carlson Spit include low vegetation and a gravel surfacing. Some areas of accumulated driftwood are located on the Spit.  There is a small watercraft launch on the northeast portion of the Spit and a small guard shack located in the southwestern portion of the tip. The existing conditions at the Upland Laboratory site include an undeveloped 5-acre forested site with an east to west slope. Trees include alder, fir, and cedar. The site will be logged of all merchantable timber prior to turnover to the Contractor.  

Geotechnical investigations by GeoEngineers for both sites will be included in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  In preparation for this project, numerous environmental studies and documents have been developed. These studies include a biological assessment (BA), an environmental assessment (EA), and two archaeological assessments. The Environmental Assessment identifies all applicable measures to be taken into account during design and construction to minimize environmental impacts. These measures require compliance. Permits sought for this project include:

¡P	Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) Section 10 Individual Permit
¡P	ƒnCoastal Consistency Determination.
¡P	ƒnHydraulic Project Approval (HPA).

Numerous agency concurrences were obtained from US Fish and Wildlife, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries (aka National Marine Fisheries Service), and Section 106 consultation with the State Historic and Preservation Office (SHPO). Final and approved copies of all environmental compliance documents and studies are provided as part of this RFP as the following attachments:

The Contractor is responsible to follow all mitigation measures as stated in the approved permits provided with the exception of the HPA. The Contractor shall only comply with the water quality mitigation recommendations stated in the HPA.

5.  The Government will award one Firm-Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible, responsive proposer whose proposal conforms to the solicitation considered to be the ¡§best value¡¨ to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Proposers will be evaluated on:  Factor I:  Past Performance & Relevant Experience; Factor II:  Management Capabilities; Factor III:  Basis of Design; Factor IV:  Subcontracting Experience, Achievement and Goals; and Factor V:  Price.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Amendment #1 Technical Questions 1. It is difficult to estimate the total travel costs \consideringthe author meeting does not have a location specified. We are able to estimate travel costs for the Research Triangle Park meetings. Should the same estimate be  utilized for the 3rd meeting?  Answer:  All meetings will be at RTP. 2. Should the technical approach you are asking the authors to provide,  reference the detailed description already outlined in the SOW?  What  additional information is required?  Answer:  Yes, the baseline is to reference the  SOW to demonstrate that offerors understand what is expected.  Offerors can suggest other concepts for implementation of the SOW, but it is not required.  3. The Technical Evaluation Criteria references "past performance" in other government contracts. We have not participated in similar  government contract work, so what should we supply as references?  Answer:  In this area the EPA is looking for past performance with any contract/grant work, with any Government office at any level, which also includes subcontracting. We are looking for similar work, but contract work with the  Government is the preference.  4. Does the EPA anticipate a single individual will be selected to write the "chronic exposure" section, and single individual write the "acute morbidity," or will a small group of professionals share responsibility for writing the initial draft?  Answer:  The EPA  will award each order to a single contractor/ consultant, who will be responsible for writing the chronic morbidity section and the acute morbidity section. A contractor/consultant can subcontract part of the effort to another individual or "group" but the single individual is responsible to  deliver the product. NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ  number is RFQ-OH-06-00180.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-11.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  The NAICS code is  541620, and the size standard is $6.5 million.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.   Project Identification:  Consultation for Air Quality Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen: Acute Morbidity II.  Period of Performance:  August 2006- August  2008 III.  Type of Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price  (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) IV.  Estimated Level of Effort:   217 hours for Tasks 1-8 (50 hours for Optional Task 9-10) BACKGROUND The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of this process, the National Center for  Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) review and integrate new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment(SA),historically known as a Criteria Document.   The EPA is now in the process of  reviewing the NAAQS for NO2.  On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary and secondary NAAQS for NO2 at 0.053 parts per million (ppm), annual average. based on the findings outlined in the 1971 NO2 Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). In 1982, EPA published the Air Quality Criteria for Oxides  of Nitrogen (EPA,1982), which updated the scientific criteria upon which the initial standards were based. On February 23, 1984, the EPA proposed to retain this standard which was finalized on June 19, 1985.  The most recent review of the science on nitrogen oxides is included in the 1993 Air  Quality Criteria for Oxides of Nitrogen(EPA-600/8-91/049cF).  In this review, the Administrator announced a final decision not to revise the standards on October 2, 1995.  The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for NO2 is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be  established as a court-ordered schedule. The EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NO2 SA by July 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the NO2  air quality standard.  The EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for  interim steps in the development of the NO2 SA, including completion of the first draft of the NO2 SA by July 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen oxides shall be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and the Science Assessment (SA).  The first draft of  the SASD will be reviewed at an authors review meeting sponsored by the EPA. This draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer review draft that shall be reviewed by peer reviewers at a public meeting. Peer review comments will be incorporated in the draft final SASD.  After the peer review  comments are incorporated to the draft final SASD, the SA (a  focused integrative document) shall be prepared as an external review draft  for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for  public comment.  The EPA anticipates  preparing two drafts of the NO2 SA for public and CASAC review, before completion of the final NO2 SA. NCEA is seeking to retain the professional services of scientists to assist with the review, critical evaluation summary and integration of the available scientific database on oxides of nitrogen  physical and chemical properties, measurement methods, environmental sources, concentrations, and pathways to human exposure, environmental effects, toxicological and human effects, and an evaluation of health risks to include public health significance. Under this order, the EPA seeks the  professional services of an expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing human health risks from oxides of nitrogen exposure.  ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments 1-4, the EPA could not  post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops website.  If a contractor or consultant is interested in this requirement, please submit a request in writing via email to Scott Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov requesting an electronic copy of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria and Attachments.  All  requests for these documents need to be submitted by close of business July 24, 2006.

<DESC>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS POSED IN RESPONSE TO 
RFQ HSFEEM-06-Q-0040

QUESTION #1 – Who developed the original course(s)?  
ANSWER #1 – The original course was developed about 24 years ago, probably by either IMR or Triton, since those were the two companies involved in EMI’s original course development efforts. There are no contractual records from that many years ago. QUESTION #2 - 	What is the estimate of the percentage of revisions required for the course (the current IEMC/All Hazards Preparedness and Response course is listed as 4 ½ days (36 hours).  There are 7.5 hours of new units/exercises identified in the solicitation, roughly 10%)?  Will the remaining revisions equal 50% or more of the course?  ANSWER #2 – The course length now is four (4) days (32 hours, Monday through Thursday) and should have two (2) exercises about two (2) hours each for Tuesday and Wednesday and a 3 ½ - 4 hour response exercise for Thursday.  QUESTION #3 – The RFQ states that step three will be to “Conduct a Focus Group Meeting.”  Will the contractor and non-contractor participants of the focus group be authorized lodging on the NETC Campus?  ANSWER #3 – Contractor staff is always provided lodging on the NETC Campus IF there is space available when they are required to be at NETC for work.  Section A.5 of the RFQ package indicated that NETC housing would be made available to contractor staff (refer to that clause).  QUESTION #4 – Step Nin states that the contractor will “Participate in the Evaluation of Pilot offering.”  Does the government intend to conduct only one (1) Pilot offering of the course?  Does the government want the contractor to provide the instructor(s) for the Pilot offering?  ANSWER #4 – One Pilot offering is intended.  EMI will secure the adjunct faculty for the Pilot offering.  The contractor shall supply 1 – 2 people to participate in the Pilot offering.
QUESTION #5 – Will the government consider using computer-generated simulations as part of the exercises?  ANSWER #5 – No.  EMI wants to use the standard type of IEMC exercise.  QUESTION #6 – Will the contractor be expected to submit the course materials for American Council on Education (ACE) review/evaluation?  ANSWER #6 – No, this will be done by EMI.  QUESTION #7 – What is the due date for receipt of proposals?  ANSWER #7 – As stated in Block #10 of the Standard Form 18 (SF18), the due date for receipt of quotes (not proposals) is Friday, August 4, 2006, 12:00 Noon, local time.  Again, these are NOT proposals.  Award will be a purchase order not a contract.  QUESTION #8 – Does the government request the pricing breakdown to be contained in a separate volume from the technical response?  ANSWER #8 – Yes.  Refer to Section A.7 of the RFQ package for Quotation Preparation Instructions.  QUESTION #9 – What is the preferred method of proposal delivery, hard copy or electronic submission?  If electronic, please provide the email address for submission.  ANSWER #9 – Electronic submission is acceptable. The address is teresa.dingle@dhs.gov.  If you choose to mail your package, my address is in the original synopsis and also in the RFQ package.

NOTE: The date for submission of quotes is unchanged.  Quotes are due by August 4, 2006, 12:00 Noon, Local Time.

If by " receptacle", you refer to electrical outlets, avoid blocking as much as possible. For example, if  necessary, use a two (2) foot partition, column, then another two (2) foot  partition. Electrical outlets can be covered when absolutely necessary, but preferably not. It is stated in the DO that ventilation must be exposed.

The transformation is intended to move the legacy force into a new modular, more expeditionary and more lethal entity capable of quickly responding to our nations future threats.  A key component to this initiative is the standing up of Centers of Sta ndardization and standard designs for 41 facility types as described below.  USACE, in achieving the Armys objectives, is requesting market research information to allow responsible Districts to support the acquisition strategy for each facility type.  In order to accomplish this, USACE will conduct four regional Industry Day forums and will implement an internet-based market research questionnaire to gather and provide information regarding the Center of Standardization (CoS) MILCON needs.  This questio nnaire need only be completed one time for the entire MILCON COS Program.  This information will be gathered according to the Armys Installation Management Agencys (IMA) four regions which are: Northeast Region (NER), Northwest Region (NWR), Southeast Re gion (SER), and Southwest Region (SWR).  Please see the market research website for a map of the states covered by each of the IMAs regions.  The market research questionnaire will be available at the following web site: https://ebs.swf.usace.army.mil/ebs /Market_Research/MarketResearchSurveyForm.cfm?ProjectID=1.  This questionnaire will be open for input on August 4, 2006, through September 4, 2006.  The US Army Corps of Engineers will execute projects of all sizes.  Therefore, it is important for Industry  to respond to this market survey and demonstrate its experience relative to each of the facility types.  The results of the survey will help the Government determine Industrys experience and capability to execute the requirements.  As this is a nation-wi de survey, you will only need to complete this survey one time for your interest and capability to be included in our research.  As a result, the acquisition strategies will potentially include both set-aside projects and unrestricted projects.   The targeted industry groups for this survey are traditional construction firms, architect-engineer firms, and contractors that provide non-traditional construction methods, such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized, Tilt-up, and Permanent Modular construction.  This Construction Program will consist of the following facility types: Physical Fitness Facility, Outdoor Sports Facility, Child Development Center  Infant/Toddlers, Child Development Center  School Age, Youth Activity Center, Consolidate d fire, Safety & Security Facility, Fire Station, Army Community Service Center, Bowling Center, Hazardous Material Storage Facility, Close Combat Tactical Trainer, Military Operations Urban Terrain Facility, Training Ranges, Battle Command Training Center , Training Support Center, Army Reserve Center,     Operational Readiness Training Complex (ORTC), General Instruction Building, Classroom, Enlisted Personnel Dinning Facility, Military Entrance Processing Station, Family Housing, Information Systems Facil ity, Criminal Investigation Facility, Religious Facility, Acces s Control Points, Aviation  Vertical Construction, 4-Star HQ Facility, National Guard Armory, Company Operations Facility, Tactical Equipment Maintenance Facility, Brigade Operations Complex, Brigade/Battalion HQ: Admin, Command and Control Army (UEy) & C orps (UEx) HQ: Admin/Ops, Deployment Facility, Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (Barracks), Basic Combat Training Complex (BCT) / One Station Unit Trainee (OSUT), Advanced Individual Training Complex (AIT), General Purpose Warehouse, Central Issue Warehouse, Hospitals, and Medical Facilities (health clinics, dental clinics, and medical clinics) to support the Centers of Standardization Army MILCON requirements.  This program will be managed by eight centers of standardization.  Scope and reach of in dividual contracts has not yet been determined.

Part: MPC-2-US110-232-N-TSP6/  DIGITEL MPC with: HV Supply One: 500-POS-7KV-K1, HV Supply Two: 500-POS-7KV-K1, Remote TSP Controller 6M cable.  Also includes TSP Control Cable 380049 3M; Quantity: 2; Unit: Each.
 
Unique design, compatibility, interchangeability with NIST’s existing equipment and unique dimensions of the Gamma Vacuum Ion Pump systems are the basis of this sole source notice of intent.

The Gamma Vacuum Ion Pump items described above will be utilized at the National Synchrotron Light Source beamlines U7A and X24A will be constrained to fit an existing NIST x-ray materials characterization facilities.

Compatibility and interchangeability with NIST’s existing Gamma Vacuum Ion Pump systems is critical.  This equipment will be used at a remote site (NSLS) in 24/7 operation located at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Rapid interchangeability with NIST’s existing equipment (between beamlines) is very important in order to maintain a high level of up time and is imperative to the success of NIST research.  Furthermore, only one set of spare parts for all Gamma Vacuum Ion Pump systems is needed, reducing costs. 

Gamma Vacuum Ion Pumps (10) are used in NIST’s existing NIST x-ray materials characterization beamlines.  Gamma Vacuum Ion Pumps to be purchased via this procurement have physical dimensions that are critical to fit within the existing NIST x-ray materials beamlines.  If other components were to be used, this would require unreasonable allocation of manpower to rebuild and redesign the beamline vacuum system.

The Gamma Vacuum Ion Pump systems are the only known available ion pumps with the characteristics of the Low Profile designs.  No other manufacturer is known to NIST to offer a closed magnetic loop or heights of less than 12 inches.  The AutoStart/AutoRun features are also unique to Gamma.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order to Rigaku Americas Corporation for upgrade of an existing D/Max-2200 PC Rigaku Ultima III x-ray system (serial number BD2817N) owned by NIST.  The upgrade requirements are as follows:

The existing x-ray must be upgraded to have a "high-resolution parallel beam optics"
so that user can do x-ray powder diffraction on a capillery samples.  The "parallel beam optics"
 should have the following minimum specifications:
 
(a) laterally graded incident beam muli-layer mirror
(b) Automated mirror control and alignment,
(c) Beam size selection slit (2, 5, 10 mm)
(d) Soller slits with 5.0 degree divergence or better.
 
The existing x-ray system must be upgraded to have a "Cross Beam Optics so that user can easily select between focusing and parallel beam optical configuatiorns without realignment of the X-ray. "Easily select" means it should not take more than 1-3 minutes to change the geometry from focusing to parallel beam optics. 
 
The existing X-ray should have a capillary sample stage which should include at least (a) sample-spinning capability and (b) simple cappilary alighment (i.e. putting a new sample and aligning it should not take more than 1-3 minutes).
 
The existing X-ray system must be upgraded to have sample holders for air-sensitive samples with reflection geometry.  The sample holders should be hermetically seable with Be and Mylar windows on Si-insert.  NIST requires at least two Be-window and two Mylar-window samples holder (in total four of them)

Based on market research conducted by NIST, NIST has only been able to identify one potential source to provide the required upgrade with equipment that is compatible with the existing Rigaku system: Rigaku Americas Corporation.  Therefore, NIST intends to award a sole source purchase order to Rigaku Americas Corporation under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) unless other responsible sources identify themselves  to joseph.widdup@nist.gov on or before the response date for this posting and clearly and unequivocally demonstrate their capability to provide such a required upgrade to the aforementioned existing Rigaku system as noted above, including authorization from Rigaku to provide such upgrade.  The Government will determine, based on written responses received in response to this posted notice, whether this procurement will be competed.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Development (USDA RD) anticipates awarding a fixed price service contract for advisory and assistance services in the completion of a draft agency regulation, RD Instruction 1940-D, Civil Rights Compliance Requirements, assistance in preparing the instruction for publication in the Federal Register, and assistance in developing a training package based on the updated provisions of the regulation.  THIS NOTICE IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  The purpose of this notice is to determine the interest of small businesses in meeting the requirements and entering into a contract.  Contractors having the capability of meeting the requirements are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information no more than ten (10) pages in length, which demonstrates its ability to meet the requirements, set forth below.  Full and complete responses are necessary to demonstrate to the Agency the Contractor’s capabilities in all aspects of the SOW.  Therefore, standard company brochures or standard capability statements are not desired.  Responses should be submitted as provided at the end of this document.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  REGULATION WRITING SERVICES FOR CIVIL RIGHTS PROGRAM COMPLIANCE.  The United States of America Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development Civil Rights Staff Program Compliance Branch (hereby referred to as the Agency) provides support and services that improve the quality of life in rural communities. The Agency works with very low, low and moderate income individuals, State, local and recognized Indian Tribal governments, as well as private and nonprofit and faith based organizations, user-owned cooperatives and special interest groups.  The Agency’s role is to increase economic opportunities and improve the quality of life for rural residents.  The Agency forges partnerships with rural communities, funding housing projects, community facilities, utilities, and other services.  The Agency also provides technical assistance and financial backing for rural businesses and cooperatives to create quality jobs in rural areas.  The Agency promotes the President’s national Energy Policy and ultimately the nation’s energy security by engaging the entrepreneurial spirit of rural America in the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements on an equal opportunity basis.  The Agency has developed a new civil rights regulation, which will replace an existing regulation and which addresses civil rights compliance for its loan and grant programs.  The development of a current and updated civil rights regulation will bring the Agency’s civil rights enforcement policies in line with current civil rights laws, Executive Orders, and regulations.  The Contractor shall: (1) update the 15 chapters of the draft regulation in accordance with current civil rights laws and prepare it for interim/final publication in the Federal Register; (2) meet with officials of the Agency’s different mission areas, enforcement agencies and public commentators to understand and incorporate changes, concerns, and/or comments affecting the final version of the regulation; and (3) based on the final version of the updated regulation, create a training program/package that includes manuals, reference materials, case studies, and power point presentations.  The Contractor may also be required to conduct training.  The anticipated period of performance is only six months from date of award, excluding the provision of training, which shall be required only as an option.  Therefore, it is imperative that the Contractor have a thorough working knowledge of the following civil rights laws and Executive Orders:

•	The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA);
•	The Fair Housing Act;
•	Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; (Federally conducted and federally assisted programs and activities)
•	Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964;
•	Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972; (Non-discrimination on the basis of sex)
•	The Age Discrimination Act of 1975; 
•	The Executive Order 11246 (non-discrimination in employment by Federally-assisted construction contracts)
•	The Executive Orders 11063, 11250, 12892 and 12898.

General knowledge of and experience with employment-based discrimination laws only does not qualify a Contractor to perform this contract and such knowledge and experience will not be used as a basis to determine that a small business is qualified to perform this contract.  The Contractor must also have experience in regulation writing.

DEADLINE AND CONTACT INFORMATION:  All responses are due to Demetria Carter by August 1, 2006 no later than 9:00 AM EST.  Qualification statements and comments may be submitted by facsimile to Demetria Carter at (202) 692-0235 or (202) 692-0117, or may be submitted electronically to demetria.carter@wdc.usda.gov.

<DESC>Previously released. Additional information added at end.

This is not an RFP. The United States Postal Service is seeking sources for a robust, best-in-class COTS supplier catalog hosting solution (Catalog Aggregator). USPS currently hosts supplier catalogs within its firewall. As part of an effort to reduce maintenance and enhancement costs, USPS is considering migrating from an internal-hosted eCatalog solution to a third party Catalog Aggregator solution. At a minimum, the source and solution must have the following capabilities:

1.	Host various supplier catalogs under contract and provide access to open market products and services (e.g., using sniffer technology for pre-qualified supplier participants under USPS B2B agreements).
2.	Allow side-by-side comparison shopping (using a total cost approach).
3.	Allow punch outs to commercially available catalogs.
4.	Section 508 compliant (or an affirmative plan to achieve 508 compliance within a reasonable period).
5.	Proven technology (Deployed for at least 1 year in a production environment among established client base).
6.	Web – Based thin client solution (no plug-ins, no cookies etc.).
7.	Allow cost effective integration with legacy systems.
8.	Detailed canned and ad-hoc reporting capabilities (including UNSPSC spend capture).
9.	Strong record of performance with clients.
10.	Financially capable with demonstrated continuous improvement record (technological adoption, enhancement releases etc.).
11.	Scalable to accommodate large number of users and large volumes of data. Here are some key statistics of the current USPS catalog system:
 
Number of Catalogs: 82
Number of Users: Approximately 87,000
Number of transactions: 1.6 million in FY 05
Number of line items: Approximately 859,000

<SUBJECT>16 -- FLIR/FSS/EO-IR Specification and Support By The Hour document, Request for Comments
<DESC>This is a Request for Comments and Information notice.  The US Coast Guard, ARSC, EISD, Elizabeth City NC is seeking vendor comments on a proposed solicitation document including Support By the Hour, specifications and a general project summary.  The Support By the Hour document and Specifications are posted on the public USCG website at www.uscg.mil/HQ/arsc/solicitations.htm   Then scroll down to the EISD contracting page to HSCG38-06-RFI-EISD007.  Comments/questions/expressions of interest in this acquisition should be directed to Constance W. Cox, Contracting Officer, tele 252 335-6895, e-mail Constance.W.Cox@uscg.mil or FAX 252 335-6463.  First cutoff date for comments will be 15 August 2006.  While comments are not required for participation in the subsequent solicitation (estimated to be published within the next 60 days), comments from FSS/FLIR OEMS will be welcomed and considered.

The U.S Coast Guard (USCG) has identified a need to equip up to 150 rotary wing aircraft with capable and supportable Electro-Optical/Infrared Sensor Systems (FSS).  The USCG is publishing this request for information to provide potential suppliers with an opportunity to review and comment on the specification, support contract and objectives.  Supplier FSS proposals will be evaluated for changeability, supportability, performance and life cycle costs.  The supplier will be responsible for insuring performance for the life of the system as defined in the enclosed Coast Guard support by the hour (SBH) document.  A government team has reviewed EO/IR market survey data and Coast Guard operational requirements to develop the enclosed FSS performance specification.  The specification defines desired and required EO/IR capabilities.  Potential suppliers are encouraged to review the enclosed documents and provide written suggestions to the contracting officer.  A request for proposals for FSS will be issued on or about 15 September 2006.  

1.	Process
The Coast Guard is publishing EO/IR FLIR Sensor Systems (FSS) requirements documentation and will consider suggestions from qualified suppliers.  Suggestions must be received at the address listed below no later than 15 August 2006.  Advance copies may be sent by e-mail to Constance.W.Cox@uscg.mil (the contracting officer) including the following in the subject line ¡§FSS Specification Comments, Company Name¡¨.  Correspondence must include a company point of contact with address, phone number and email address.

The Coast Guard will revise the FSS documents based upon industry comments and publish a solicitation for FSS procurement.  Proposals will be required on or about 15 September 2006.  The proposals will be evaluated by a Coast Guard Technical Evaluation Team with concurrent technical review and comment by NWSC Crane.  The target for the initial contract award is 15 November 2006.  The first article(s) will be required for evaluation on or about 15 February 2007.  First article tests will be performed both in the lab at NWSC Crane and in flight tests on Coast Guard aircraft.  Six systems will be procured as soon as possible.  Additional systems will be procured as funding becomes available.

2.	Scope
The FSS may be installed on any DHS aircraft.  The FSS will be installed on aircraft now operating without FLIR and the FSS will replace the FLIR systems currently in service on Coast Guard rotary wing aircraft. The requirement includes life cycle support, the EO/IR FSS system and recording capability.  The recording requirement may be a separate procurement from the FSS.  The support contract is intended for 150 Coast Guard aircraft.  Additional DHS aircraft may added as required.

3.	Background
The Coast Guard currently operates (99) H-65 and (41) H-60 aircraft.  These aircraft require sensor improvements to support Coast Guard¡¦s Statutory Mission Requirements (e.g. SAR, MDA, HLS, & ELT).  A requirement for airborne use of force (AUF) capability for Coast Guard helicopters is evolving rapidly.  AUF equipment, including the FSS, will be installed in all H-60 aircraft and, initially, a subset of the H-65 fleet.  There is an immediate need to equip six H-65 aircraft for operations in the fall of 2007 to support critical Airborne Use of Force national security requirements.  Current plans call for a minimum of 46 Airborne Use of Force aircraft equipped with FSS. From the point of award forward, FSS systems will be enrolled in a scalable support contract in increments of 10 systems up to an operational fleet of approximately 150 systems. 

The Coast Guard has identified the need to improve on typical industry support plans for FLIR systems.  The Coast Guard has over 20 years of experience with maintenance and repair support by the hour (SBH) for engines and avionics components.  The FSS SBH document was defined based on the successful support by the hour (SBH) agreements currently utilized by the Coast Guard.

4.	Objectives

4.1	Support
The Coast Guard support requirements are defined in the attached Support By the Hour (SBH) document.  Coast Guard aircraft operate in a demanding environment.  SBH is intended to insure the FSS is supported in the Coast Guard operating environment.  SBH is intended to align the supplier and Coast Guard interests to provide fully mission capable systems available for Coast Guard operations.  The supplier is responsible for the performance of their product.  SBH provides a framework for the Coast Guard and supplier partnership for the life of the FSS.  The Coast Guard will consider suggestions for modifications to the SBH plan.  Suppliers will be allowed to offer alternative support plans.  However, at a minimum pricing must be provided for the Coast Guard defined SBH.  Evaluation of suppliers will be based on life cycle costs derived from the Coast Guard SBH.

4.2	Performance
The Coast Guard FSS requirements are defined in the attached FLIR Sensor System (FSS) performance Specification.  Additional information is provided below for the key performance parameters.
	
4.2.1	Compatibility
The FSS must be capable of full integration with the aircraft to minimize impacts associated with weight, ground clearance, cabin space, and avoid safety issues such as emergency egress and hard landings.  The system must provide for ergonomic human interfaces compatible with aircrew personnel, procedures, equipment, and proficiency capabilities.  The FSS lighting, displays, controls and indicators shall be optimized for viewing with the unaided eye and compatible with aircrew Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations.  The system must be have the capability to point and maintain sensor line-of-sight to a known or designated position.  The point command and data shall be capable of interface with a digital map system, Radar, CDU, Heads Up Display with Line of Sight (HUD/LOS) capability for turret control and/or video storage/datalink systems.

4.2.2	Identification
The primary technical performance evaluation standard will be the ability to read 6¡¨ letters during nighttime operations from in excess of 1 nautical mile.  The system shall include incorporation of a definitive planned product improvement program, specifically designed to enhance nighttime identification fidelity and standoff range.

4.2.3	Interface
The FSS must be designed to interface with the RADAR and provide the capability to slew the FSS to a RADAR contact or waypoint data, and slave the FSS to the contact.  The FSS must provide auto-track, auto-scan and auto-focus capability.  The FSS must provide a field of regard of 360 degrees continuous azimuth.  The system must include a hand controller that is portable throughout the cabin area, designed to minimize egress hazards and other potential interferences or safety hazards.  The FSS shall provide nominal operational configuration for urgent missions while using the minimum cabin compartment space practical for installation of mission hardware.  

4.2.3	Open Architecture

The FSS shall be designed to incorporate an open architecture to the greatest extent possible and use standard government and commercial protocols.  The system should minimize proprietary interfaces and systems. 

5.	Vendor Qualification

<DESC>This requirement is being procured and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) located in Seattle, WA intends to procure on a sole source basis with Wildlife & Veterinary Consultants to coordinate final analyses, drafting, revision, and submission of three journal articles for publication in the Peer-Reviewed literature, the period of performance is 9/1/2006 to 8/31/2007
NMML has, since 1985, conducted basic and applied research on the ecology of seals inhabiting the sea ice in polar regions, using satellite telemetry methods.  The data amassed from this research compose a broad array of information on the movements, diving, and haul-out behavior of 8 species of seals from the northern and southern hemispheres, along with ancillary data on the physical and biological environment.  The data contain a wealth of information that may be critical to assessments of the impacts of climate change on ice seal populations.  To fully exploit the potential of these data and present them through the peer-reviewed scientific literature will require the creation of several scholarly manuscripts that integrate the research results across the many years of the studies and across the single-species focused projects. The NMML requires an experienced researcher to coordinate final analyses, drafting, revision, and submission of three journal articles for publication in the peer-reviewed literature.
The synthesis and integration of a multi-year, multi-species ecological study and the authorship and publication of the results in the peer-reviewed ecological literature require an intimate familiarity with the research methods, the species, and the geographic study regions.
Wildlife and Veterinary Consultants, has been a participant and collaborator in nearly every project of this ice seal research.
This notice may reoresent the only official notice. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $50,000

<DESC>PART I  -  GENERAL INFORMATION


A.  INTRODUCTION:

The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), in Hawaii, announces a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for Architect and Engineering (A&E) firms interested in contracting for A&E Services for engineering planning services for the Northern Guam Watershed, located on the Island of Guam.

The primary goal of the Watershed Plan is to identify and evaluate potential sources of irrigation water, with particular emphasis on adequacy of volume to support agriculture through the dry season, impacts resulting from development of identified water resources and costs associated with developing the resources.  The development of the water resource specifically shall include infrastructure to deliver irrigation water for agricultural operations to each landholding within the planned area.

Tract 1021 (also referred to as Tract I or Tract 10120) is located in northern Guam.  It is under the jurisdiction of the Chamorro Land Trust Commission (CLTC) and dedicated to long term agricultural use.  The Northern Guam Soil & Water Conservation District (SWCD) is a government entity instituted by Government of Guam  Public Law 17-51.  The SWCD is comprised of five board members elected by the registered farmers.  The group is seeking assistance from NRCS to address an identified critical and recurring need for ample water supply for farmers in Tract 1021 in the villages of Dededo and Yigo.  More than 70 farmers hold long term agricultural leases in the 817 acre project area.

THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED and is therefore open to all businesses regardless of size.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541310, and the small business size standard is $4.5 million.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence for the required work.  The Government contemplates the award of a firm-fixed price contract resulting from this competition.


B.  STATEMENT OF WORK:

The Contractor shall perform watershed planning to determine the quantity of irrigation water required to address agricultural needs for the planned area, possible sources of supplemental irrigation water, appropriate configurations (layout, sizes) of water distribution systems to the various parcels within the planned area.  The distribution system(s) may be independent of the water source however each potential source of irrigation water shall have a distribution system capable of delivering the necessary water to the various landholdings in the planned area.  Specifically the watershed plan shall include the costs and impacts (environmental, economic and social) of each irrigation water source and distribution configuration in accordance with NRCS policy, Federal and Territorial laws and regulations.  The technical feasibility (practicality of installation, system capacity, design life, etc.) of each evaluated water source and distribution system will be documented with maps, survey, computations, etc. in accordance with sound engineering practice.

The Contractor shall provide all expertise in agronomy, engineering, geology, hydrology, cultural resources, economics, and environmental/regulatory issues necessary to develop detailed alternative solutions to the problem of dry season water shortages.  The final product will be in the form of a draft Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) sufficient in detail and supporting documentation to be published for public comment and input.

Possible scenarios might include, but are not limited to, collection of water (runoff from impervious and low infiltration areas) combined with large storage capacity, minimal wells and sufficient storage to provide water over the duration of the dry season, a large number of wells and minimal storage (for regulating flow rather than depending on pump pressure to deliver water through the system),  Anticipated well yields shall be estimated on proposed locations and geologic information at the proposed location or if utilizing existing wells, known sustainable yield for the well.


C.  SPECIFIC ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN BY THE CONTRACTOR:

1.  Develop a Schedule of Work conforming to all applicable NRCS policy and criteria.  The plan shall include specific tasks with due dates for completion of the tasks and shall be in conformance with the Plan of Work, Exhibit 1 in the specifications.

2.  Assess the current condition of the planned area: physical boundaries, current land use, current available water supply, current agricultural water requirements, pertinent cultural resources present, relevant biologic concerns (flora and fauna), topographic, soil and geologic features, and socio-economic conditions (population, land use, regulations, general economics).

3.  Develop and document alternative solutions addressing any determined agricultural water shortages anticipated during dry seasons.  Alternatives will necessarily consider and anticipate changes in land use resulting from any increase in water availability resulting from the implementation of the alternative, i.e. should more water become available, it is likely that more land will be under intense agriculture use than the current situation.  In short, some anticipation of the future condition of the planned area must be included as part of the planning effort.

4.  Coordinate activities during the alternative development process with the Sponsors (Guam Department of Agriculture, the Northern Guam Soil and Water Conservation District), and USDA NRCS.  This will be accomplished with meetings with representatives of the four parties (NRCS, Northern Guam SWCD, Government of Guam Department of Agriculture) no less frequently than once per month during the performance period.  More frequent meetings may be required and other parties may have interest or need to participate in the meetings, e.g. Guam Waterworks Authority, Guam Department of Public Works, Chamorro Land Trust Commission, etc.

5.  The performance time is one hundred twenty (120) calendar days from NRCS acceptance of the mutually agreed to schedule of work submitted by the Contractor.  The final product will meet the requirements as listed in the Specifications.


 
D.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

The Contractor will furnish all equipment, personnel and materials to perform the tasks listed in the specifications.  The project will require knowledge and experience in land use planning, water supply and distribution planning, agriculture, possibly surveying, completing economic analysis and assessing current biological, cultural resource, social and environmental conditions and impacts of potential alternatives.

Formulation and evaluation of alternatives will likely include literature search, contact with affected landowners, public utilities, project sponsors, regulatory authorities, the general public, and others.  Site investigation for the area to be planned is essential as is documentation of the data gathered (digital photographs, spreadsheets, documents, maps, notes, etc.).  



PART II  -  PRE-SELECTION CRITERIA

Only firms meeting the following criteria will be considered for further evaluation

1.  Employ two (2) engineers on a full time basis with one registered in the Territory of Guam.  Engineering experience will be at least for distinct experiences in the planning or design of water supply, water distribution, and/or irrigation type water resource projects.

2.  Have either in-house or available as a subcontractor a source for performing topographic surveys.  Four distinct topographic survey experiences must be listed on the submitted Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications.

3.

<DESC>EXHIBIT SPACE - AIR FORCE ASSOCIATION NATIONAL CONVENTION     

The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract on a Sole-Source basis for the purchase of items listed in the Description of Supplies.     This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being accepted and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This requirement is issued as a request for quotation.     The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04.

The NAICS Code is 531120; size standard $6.5 million.

IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304c (1) , as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1-- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.     A Firm Fixed Priced Award will be in accordance with the following Description of Supplies: 

DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES 

A.     Following items will be provided:

CLIN: 0001
Description:     Exhibit booth space (8’ x 10’)
Quantity:     Twenty-one (21)

B.     Period of Performance:  19 September 2006 through 28 September 2006. 
                         

JUSTIFICATION:     

The Marriott Wardman Park Hotel and the Omni Sheraton Hotel have been selected to host this year’s CSTEA participants.  The CSTEA has been scheduled for September 19-28, 2006.  Part of the CSTEA plan calls for exhibition displays, a ceremony, and a reception.  As participants in the CSTEA program, twenty competing CSTEA teams are required to set up  exhibition display booths to network and dialogue on their process improvements.  The Air Force Association (AFA) has selected the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel to host the AFA National Convention.  In the Government’s better interest, market research conducted by AFMA supports a determination made by the planning committee to hold the exhibitions, ceremony, and reception portion of the CSTEA program in the same facility where the awards and convention activities are scheduled to take place.  The AFA has leased the entire Marriott Wardman Park Hotel for September 22 – 29, 2006 and has designated areas for exhibitions to be held during the convention at the Hotel.  During CSTEA 2006, the AFA is the office of primary responsibility for setting up the AFA National Convention and the sole source for the rental of all areas within the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel.   The CSTEA planning committee recommends the AFA National Convention as the source to satisfy the CSTEA requirement.  The AFA convention is tailored to the professional requirements of Air Force enlisted, officers, guardsmen, and reservists.  Furthermore, it provides AFMA a unique opportunity to promote the CSTEA program in an exclusive environment.  The effectiveness, spirit, and moral boost achieved by AFMA’s CSTEA Program will deteriorate considerably if AFMA is unable to secure exhibition booths and space as required by the CSTEA program.  Market research identified no other vendors providing compatible services withing the Marriott/Omni vicinity during the CSTEA scheduled time frame.  For these reasons it is determined that no source other than the AFA can meet this requirement.

TRICARE requires the following:  

I.	Introduction:

TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is responsible for editing and processing hospital outpatient claims for TRICARE eligible beneficiaries.  3M Health Information Systems has developed an Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) for editing and processing hospital outpatient claims which will be utilized upon implementation of TRICARE’s Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) tentatively scheduled for implementation on June 1, 2007.  The supplemental functionality required by TMA is for licensing a mainframe version of a TRICARE specific OPPS Pricer that can be fully integrated with the 3M OCE, and licensing PC Versions that integrate both the OCE and Pricer software and are compatible with the TRICARE mainframe software.  

II.	Purpose:

The purpose of this Statement of Work is to outline TMA’s requirements for licensing a commercial mainframe version of a TRICARE specific OPPS Pricer that can be fully integrated with the 3M OCE, and licensing PC versions that includes both the OCE and Pricer software for auditing and verification of accuracy of payment for hospital outpatient claims.  This procurement will be for the licensing, maintenance and updating of both the mainframe and PC software versions as they become available.  The maintenance, to include quarterly updates, will have a 12 month period of performance for the Base year and four successive one year Option Periods.  

III.	Background:

a.	TMA is legislatively mandated to follow all Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement methodologies whenever practicable.  As a result, TMA has been working on the development, in conjunction with 3M, and implementation of a prospective payment system for processing hospital outpatient claims.  OPPS is comprised of two components:

	1.	The first component is the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) designed for editing and processing hospital outpatient claims.  Since 3M maintains CMS’ OCE they agreed to develop and maintain a similar TRICARE OCE.  They will retain proprietary rights to the software. 

 	2.	The second component is the Pricer that determines how to price claims 	based on the output from the OCE.  Due to the complexity of TRICARE’s OPPS, the TRICARE Management Activity has decided to license a commercial mainframe TRICARE Pricer to include quarterly updates that coincide with those of CMS.  

(a)	TRICARE is congressionally mandated to follow CMS’ OPPS reimbursement methodology where practicable.  It is critical the Contractor have access to advance copies of CMS’ OCE changes in order to meet quarterly updates.  In accordance with 32 C.F.R. 199.1 (c)(2)(ii), CMS has agreed to allow 3M to provide TRICARE with advance copies of OCE changes due to the delegated authority given to the Assistant Secretary for Health, DHHS, to consult with the Secretary of Defense, or a designee and to approve and issue joint regulations implementing 10. U.S.C. chapter 55.

(b)	TMA has decided to license a mainframe version of the TRICARE Pricer software in order to ensure: 

i.	Uniformity of Pricing among Regions
ii.	Programmatic control to ensure consistent and timely updates(requires quarterly updating of pricing files)
iii.	Consistency with CMS pricing methodologies 
iv.	Integration between TRICARE specific OCE and Pricer software
v.	Portability of Pricer software for future contract transitions 

IV.	Deliverable/s:

The Contractor shall deliver the following:

	Line Item 0001

<DESC>SYNOPSIS AND SOLICITATION.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 and FAR Part 15, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. zThis announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSCG23-06-R-DNQ157, which is a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The NAICS code is 315999.  The proposed contract is 100% Set-Aside for Small Business concerns.  Small Business size standard is 500 Employees.  The Period of Performance for this requirement will be five years.  A Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract is anticipated.  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) has a continuing requirement to provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to the field to perform various operational missions.  The USCG and DHS as a whole, are attempting to standardize PPE where ever possible to be more efficient and effective.  The dry suits supplied through this acquisition may be ordered by any DHS Organizational Element.  The suits shall have a standard operational life of at least three (3) years.  You are requested to provide your policies on warranted items and length of the warranty beyond the required three (3) years.  The USCG and other DHS Organizational Elements require the contractor to deliver Lightweight Dry Suits and Industrial Dry Suits.  Both the Lightweight Dry Suit and the Industrial Dry Suit will be used in maritime, terrestrial, airborne, shipboard, and transitional environments.  The mission will determine which suit should be worn.  Both the Lightweight Dry Suit and the Industrial Dry Suit shall be completely assembled, ready for use, commercial off the shelf, garments that are completely waterproof and moisture vapor permeable.  The definition of waterproof for the purposes of this requirement means that the suit has been constructed from a waterproof fabric (a coated fabric satisfying the hydrostatic resistance requirements of the ASTM-D-3393, found at http://www.astm.org) and after construction, the suit is leak checked by the manufacturer to prove that no leaks exist.  No leaks are allowable.  Both types of dry suits, hereinafter referred to as “the suits,” shall provide water vapor management and must be durable enough for rugged field use.  The suits shall keep the operator dry in all weather conditions without interfering with typical mission movements or compromising range of motion for activities including, but not limited to swimming, running, assault movements and weapons manipulation.  The suits must be lightweight, fit comfortably and must be able to keep the operator dry while immersed in water without water leakage into the suit.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the USCG to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.

    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

Proposals must be in accordance with the format described in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This notice/announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and no other written solicitation will be issued.

Solicitation N68335-06-R-0025 is issued as an RFP. This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.   This document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-09.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 335129, Federal Supply Class (FSC) Code 6230, Small Business Size 500.    

The Government may award multiple contracts from this solicitation using the procedures in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  Firm Fixed Price Contract with five (5) options (See Section B).  Options may be exercised in whole or in part.   Inspection and acceptance shall be at Destination.  Shipping shall be F.O.B Destination, Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Contractor is requested to provide their best delivery schedule.  Payment will be made by the appropriate DFAS finance center upon delivery of the items.

The NAVAIR Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Team seeks to acquire new airfield lighting components to satisfy  the United States Marine Corps (USMC) requirement for a Man-Portable suite of equipment.  It is desired that these components be simple to operate, be small and lightweight, take maximum advantage of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technologies, and require a minimum of logistics support.

For the purpose of this specification, the term “light” shall be understood as the item capable of producing visual and infrared (IR) energy.  The term “accessories” refers to any additional component or components that may be needed, at no specific time, to augment the installation and/or control of the light.

A.	Minimum Requirements.  The following parameters must be met to satisfy the needs of the US Marine Corps:

	1.	General.  Light shall be “universal” and capable of supporting runway edge, taxiway edge, runway threshold and runway approach lighting applications.  Light shall be wireless, and operate from a commercially available primary battery.  The light shall make use of light emitting diode or other solid state source(s), and be capable of producing white, red, green, blue, and IR output.  A clear lens shall be employed to protect the light/IR source(s) and provide the required optical coverage.  The light shall produce a steady output and have the means to manually switch between “off”, each color, and IR.

	2.	Color Output.  Light shall be capable of producing individual colors falling within the specified limits for the following designations in accordance with SAE AS25050:
			“Aviation White”
			“Aviation Green”
			“Aviation Red”
			“Aviation Blue”

	3.	Infrared Output.  A high degree of perceptibility by Generation 3+ Night Vision Devices (NVDs) with low visual (naked eye) observability is required.  The infrared output shall have a peak emission and/or centroid wavelength between 850 and 900 nanometers.  The half-power bandwidth of the infrared output shall be as narrow as possible to minimize visibility to the naked eye, while still maintaining the desired acquisition distance stated later in this specification.  Radiometric data may be measured to quantify and empirically compare differences otherwise deemed subjective in nature.

	4.	Flashing Capability.  Light shall be capable of being set to produce a flashing output for each color and infrared.  Flash rate shall be 80 flashes per minute (+/- 5 fpm) with a nominal 50% duty cycle.

	5.	Output Intensity.  Color/IR output from the light shall be visible as follows:
			WHITE - Visible at a distance of 2 nautical miles at night (with naked eye).
			GREEN - Visible at a distance of 1 nautical mile at night (with naked eye).
			RED - Visible at a distance of 1 nautical mile at night (with naked eye).
			BLUE - Visible at a distance of 2000 feet at night (with naked eye).
		 INFRARED - Visible at a distance of 2 nautical miles at night through Generation 3+ NVDs; and not visible beyond 10 feet with naked eye.

	6.	Output Coverage.  Output shall be produced from 0 to +90 degrees in the vertical plane, and at all radials throughout an omni-directional 360 degrees.  Maximum output intensity, allowing the acquisition ranges stated previously, shall be maintained through a vertical beam spread covering no less than the portion between +2 and +10 degrees in the vertical plane.

	7.	Operational Endurance.  Light shall be capable of providing a steady output for a minimum of 10 hours from a fresh battery supply.

8.	Remote Control.  Light shall be capable of being fitted to a wireless, radio frequency remote control receiver allowing for on/off control of the fixture.

	9.	Mounting.  Light shall be capable of being fitted to a separate mounting base.  Mounting base shall be capable of being secured to surfaces including, but not limited to: routine/hard soil, asphalt, rock, coral, concrete, and various types of airfield surfacing materials (matting).  Attaching hardware for securing the fixture to such surfaces will be determined and sourced separately by NAVAIR Lakehurst.  Mounting base shall be retrievable, and possess a means to positively lock the light to the base.  Mounting base shall permit the light to be aimed at various positions, ranging from, and including, full horizontal (flat) to full vertical (standing).  Mounting base shall require no scheduled maintenance and is to be considered a “consumable” item.

	10.	Weight.  Each light, including battery, shall weigh no more than 16 ounces.

	11.	Repairability.  Light shall require no scheduled maintenance (other than battery replacement) and is to be considered a “consumable” item.

	12.	Packaging.  Each new light shall be delivered from the supplier with one new battery (not installed) and packaged in accordance with best commercial practices.

	13.	Technical Documentation.  All operation and maintenance procedures shall be provided by the supplier in a thorough and concise commercial technical manual.  Topics desired in such manual include, but need not be limited to: tabulation of salient characteristics, operating procedures (on/off/color selection, for example), battery replacement procedures, remote control operating procedures, and illustrated parts list with part nomenclature, numbers and/or National Stock Numbers (as applicable).  If the commercial manual offered does not fully satisfy the technical and logistical requirements deemed necessary by NAVAIR Lakehurst, the Government reserves the right to develop their own manual based upon technical information available from the supplier.

B.	Desired Requirements.  The following enhanced capabilities are desirable for the light and/or accessories, but not required to meet the needs of the US Marine Corps:

1.a.	Remote Control Receiver.  Remote control receiver shall be capable of attaching directly to the light, and shall cause minimum obstruction to the light output.  Receiver shall be capable of switching the attached light on or off as selected by the remote control transmitter.  Receiver shall require no scheduled maintenance and is to be considered a “consumable” item.

1.b.	Remote Control Transmitter.  Remote operation shall be controlled by a dedicated handheld transmitter with a minimum effective range of 10 meters.  Transmitter shall operate from a commercially available primary battery type.  Transmitter shall require no scheduled maintenance (other than battery replacement) and is to be considered a “consumable” item.  Transmitter shall be delivered from the supplier with one new battery (not installed) and packaged in accordance with best commercial practices.

	2.	Operational Endurance.  Light capable of providing a steady output for a minimum of 16 hours from a fresh battery supply.

	3.	Output Intensity.  All colors visible at a distance of at least 2 nautical miles at night with naked eye.

	4.	Color Output.  Light capable of producing the following output colors (in accordance with MIL-STD-3009 as applied to the 1976 UCS chromaticity diagram):

The test quote should be provided for tests assumed to run a total time duration of 48 hours, using the procedures described below.   The following LCF testing procedures should be utilized; deviations from this should be coordinated with NASA GRC prior to conducting the tests: PGR-3-1997 LCF specimens:   1.	Measure and control temperature using a procedure specifically pre-agreed with NASA 2.	First run 10+ cycles in load control, then 10+ cycles in strain control, both at about 0.2% strain range (R=0) to check extensometer stability and the test system¡¦s control stability. 3.	Start test using an agreed startup procedure which gradually increases the strain range to the target value at a slow frequency of 0.05 hertz while avoiding overstrains.  Then continue the test at a frequency of 0.33 hertz for 24 hours.  Then: a.	If max. and min. cyclic stresses are stabilized, please switch to load control at 10 hertz with the same max. and min. cyclic stresses, run to 5x106 cycles runout. b.	If cyclic stresses are still relaxing by more than 1 ksi per 500 cycles, continue until stabilized for mode switch for up to 2 more hours.  Call if not yet stabilized. 4.	Run most tests to failure, agreed tensile load drop, or agreed runout cycles.  Place fracture specimen halves in the plastic tube with the button ends butting together, fracture surfaces protected from metal contact. 5.	It will be requested that several tests be stopped approximately three to four times during the life of the specimen at NASA specified cycle increments.  After each interruption the specimens shall be separately packaged, marked with specimen ID number and send for an overnight mail delivery shipment to NASA. After the first interruption the tests shall be switched from strain control to load control and cycled for a designated number of fatigue cycles.  Initial set up fee for strain control as well as subsequent set up fee for load control testing segments shall be assumed for any interrupted tests.

	3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S.  The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm.

By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)

Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.
 
1.	Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:     

a.	Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB  No. 1615-0047,  " Employment Eligibility Verification, "  and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b.	Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents.  This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c.	Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.  Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:  
 
	•	High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
	•	Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
	•	Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation
    
d.	The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:  

	1)	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
	2)	Favorable fingerprint results; 
	3)	Favorable credit report, if required;3 
	4)	Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
	5)	Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC)4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.  

	A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 
 
	If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 
 
e.	Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated.  If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.
 
2.	Short-Term Contractor Personnel:  

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
 
a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b.	Favorable fingerprint results; 
c.	Favorable credit report, if required;5 and 
d.	Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. 
For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered “long-term” and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.  

3.	Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.  

a.	For purposes of this policy, “intermittent” is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.  
b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department’s escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.  

d.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.

2 Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer.  The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge.  The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.

3 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.

4 In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM.  Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block  " B "  of the  " Agency Use Only "  section of the investigative form.  This report is available for all case types.

5 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.

UNSAFE CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (JAR 2852.223-70) (JUN 1996)

(a)	"Unsafe condition" as used in this clause means the actual or potential exposure of contractor or Government employees to a hazardous material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or working condition designated by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety controls.

(b)	The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to apprise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.

(c)	Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will be working.

(d)	If during the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, discovers the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee (with written notice provided not later than three (3) working days thereafter) of the existence of an unsafe condition. Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.

Mailing and Shipping Solutions

1.0	INTRODUCTION

1.1  Organization

U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)
Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)
Office of Administration and Management
Management Services Division (MSD)
Facilities and Property Management Branch
1100 Wilson Boulevard
Arlington, VA 22209-3939

1.2  Mission

The mission of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) and to enforce compliance with mandatory safety and health standards as a means to eliminate fatal accidents; to reduce the frequency and severity of nonfatal accidents; to minimize health hazards; and to promote improved safety and health conditions in the Nation's mines. MSHA carries out the mandates of the Mine Act at all mining and mineral processing operations in the United States, regardless of size, number of employees, commodity mined, or method of extraction.

1.3	Project Background

1.3.1	MSHA maintains over 100 field offices in 38 states and Puerto Rico. Offices vary in size from one person field duty stations to large district offices greater than 60 employees.  MSHA currently employs postage rate scales and meters in order to determine and affix postage to outgoing mail in most offices. When postage rates changed on January 8, 2006, MSHA discovered that its postage vendor would no longer provide updates for older postage rate scales, rendering them obsolete. Also, MSHA currently cannot track postage use and mail volume at the field office level without relying on employee surveys or questionnaires. 
MSHA desires to find a mailing and shipping solution that avoids planned obsolescence, provides detailed use information, and provides centralized billing for the various office locations. MSHA believes it can achieve this solution by replacing scale and meter technology with a Web based postage provider.
MSHA will acquire web based postage services through an RFP for a Base period of 1 year and four (4)1-year option periods.

<DESC>NONDESTRUCTIVE CRACK DETECTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR STEEL BRIDGES

The Federal Highway Administration's Non-Destructive Evaluation Validation Center (FHWA-NDEVC), located in McLean VA, has a requirement to conduct a steel bridge testing program to facilitate the development and field deployment of nondestructive technologies that are able to detect fatigue cracks in steel bridges.  FHWA’s interest will be focused on identifying the presence of cracks in steel girders at fatigue prone, high stress, or critical detail locations.  Parameters of interest in this study include crack size, depth, orientation, and potentially the capability to determine crack growth rates. Accordingly, both promising crack detection technologies and crack growth technologies are of interest.

COMMERCIAL SOLICITATION
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12

This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in [FAR] Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included herein. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The provisions at FAR 52.212-1 apply. FAR 52.212-4 and 52.212-5 will be included in any award resulting from this notice. Full text for these FAR provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://acquisition.gov/far/index.html. 

OBJECTIVE

The Government’s overall objective for the steel bridge testing program is to develop an informational database of current, state-of-the-art, developmental, and prototypical technologies and their associated capabilities and parameters. Ultimately, the database will be used by bridge owners and inspectors to meet their bridge inspection, evaluation, and safety needs by facilitating proper and cost-effective mitigation and repair strategies. The primary purpose of the database is to provide information on the types of technologies available and their associated capabilities,  characteristics, and limitations, rather than side-by-side brand name comparisons. Inclusion of particular products within the database does not constitute an endorsement by the Federal Government.

TECHNOLOGY CHARACTERISTICS

The candidate crack detection technology shall possess at least one of the following characteristics:

·	Capable of detecting both surface and subsurface cracks in steel.
·	Require minimum if any surface preparation.
·	Can be implemented on uneven surfaces to detect cracks in crown, toe or root of the weld.
·	Ability to detect cracks through surface coatings or the rust coat on weathering steels.
·	Portable and field deployable.
 
Such technologies may include, but are not limited to, ultrasonic (UT), acoustic emission, eddy current, thermographic imaging, radiography, magnetic particle, and dye penetrant techniques.   

EVALUATION PROCESS

This solicitation is designed to cover only commercially available products, or those products which can meet the Government's requirements with minimal modification. The Government is seeking responses from manufacturers (or their authorized Washington D.C. representatives), including value-added resellers. Developmental products and/or prototype systems will not be considered under this solicitation, but may be evaluated under a separate Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) or Sources Sought notice which may, at the Government's sole option, be issued at a later date. 

Evaluation of commercial products under this solicitation will take place in two phases. In Phase I, the Government will conduct a preliminary screening of crack detection technologies to identify those which show the most potential to meet the Government's requirements, and that may be suitable for further laboratory assessment and field testing. The Government will review commercial product literature and any supplementary information provided, including existing test results and current installations (as applicable). The result of Phase I will be an invitation to selected manufacturers to proceed to Phase II. 

In Phase II, manufacturers will be invited to make an oral and/or electronic presentation of their company and technology, and conduct a demonstration of their system at the FHWA-NDEVC. Each manufacturer is responsible for all costs associated with the presentation and demonstration. The Government will not reimburse manufacturers for such costs. Specific details will be provided to those manufacturers who are selected to participate in Phase II.

IDIQ CONTRACT AWARD

Based on the Phase II evaluation, the Government intends to award one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts utilizing firm fixed-price task orders. The purpose of these contracts will be to enable the Government to continue evaluating selected representative technologies, both in the laboratory and in the field. Task orders under these IDIQ contracts will purchase, rent, lease, or license (as applicable) the products and/or systems to be evaluated. Technical services to support the Government's testing program may also be ordered as required. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA

For each Phase of this solicitation, offerors will be evaluated on the following factors:  Technical, Price, Delivery, and Past Performance. The Government will use the Best Value Trade-Off process to advance offerors through each phase of the solicitation.

By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)

Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.
 
1.	Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:     

a.	Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB  No. 1615-0047,  " Employment Eligibility Verification, "  and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b.	Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents.  This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c.	Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.  Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:  
 
	•	High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
	•	Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
	•	Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation
    
d.	The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:  

	1)	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
	2)	Favorable fingerprint results; 
	3)	Favorable credit report, if required;3 
	4)	Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
	5)	Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC)4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.  

	A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 
 
	If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 
 
e.	Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated.  If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.
 
2.	Short-Term Contractor Personnel:  

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
 
a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b.	Favorable fingerprint results; 
c.	Favorable credit report, if required;5 and 
d.	Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. 
For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered “long-term” and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.  

3.	Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.  

a.	For purposes of this policy, “intermittent” is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.  
b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department’s escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.  

d.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.

Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.

(e)	When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.

(f)	Nothing contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including but not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.

For three of the five years immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under a contract or commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing services must have:

	1. legally resided in the United States (U.S.);
	2. worked for the U.S. overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or
	3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S.  The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm.

By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)

Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.
 
1.	Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:     

a.	Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB  No. 1615-0047,  " Employment Eligibility Verification, "  and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b.	Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents.  This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c.	Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.  Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:  
 
	•	High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
	•	Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
	•	Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation
    
d.	The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:  

	1)	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
	2)	Favorable fingerprint results; 
	3)	Favorable credit report, if required;3 
	4)	Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
	5)	Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC)4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.  

	A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 
 
	If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 
 
e.	Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated.  If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.
 
2.	Short-Term Contractor Personnel:  

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
 
a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b.	Favorable fingerprint results; 
c.	Favorable credit report, if required;5 and 
d.	Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. 
For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered “long-term” and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.  

3.	Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.  

a.	For purposes of this policy, “intermittent” is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.  
b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department’s escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.  

d.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.

For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.  
b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department’s escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.  

d.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.

Added 26 July 06:
The body text has been changed to reflect the correct bid closing date and other minor clause changes.  To clear up some confusion, I will address a few concerns.  The training will 100% on the contractor.  The contractor will provide all materials, facilities, trainers, equipment, etc to train the 26 trainees during the course.  If your company does not have the capability of completely providing the housing, meals, training, and transportation to do this training, please do not submit a bid.  The contractor is responsible for providing the training areas/facilities, regardless if they are your property or rented for the purposes of the training, because the training will NOT be at Travis AFB.  The course will need to address the "hands on" part of anti terrorism training mostly.  Please review the e-mailed documents and amendments, and provide a quote if your company is capable.
