EVALUATION FACTORS
Potential Contractors shall be evaluated in terms of the factors/criteria identified below.  Submissions will be evaluated against the evaluation factors as they relate to the requirements of the solicitation, as well as evaluated for meeting mandatory responsibility criteria per FAR Subpart 9.1.  A detailed evaluation will be made of the submissions.  Submissions must demonstrate a thorough understanding of and the capability to accomplish the overall requirements as stated in the following evaluation factors. Firms will be evaluated on the following factors listed in descending order of importance: 

Evaluation Factor 1 – Specialized Experience and Technical Competence 
The Board will evaluate the specialized experience on similar projects and the technical capabilities of the prime offeror and any subcontractors.  The Board will examine the effectiveness of the proposed project team to ensure the Offeror’s ability to coordinate the needs of several of the Government’s key partners. This will include evaluating the management structure; coordination of disciplines; offices and/or subcontractors; and the prior working relationships between team members. Also to be reviewed is how successful the offeror is in integrating the needs of multiple clients/partners.  The Board will evaluate submissions to determine if a history of successful execution of designs for public administrative and recreation facilities, including Visitor Orientation and Learning facilities in environmentally sensitive settings can be demonstrated. Specifically the Board will evaluate offeror’s/teams experience with:  (a) Sustainable design; (b) Previous LEED-certified designs and projects; (c) Recreational design specifically addressing needs of multicultural communities; (d) Managing projects with natural resource agencies corporate cultures; (e) Designing interior/exterior spaces that effectively gather, engage and inspire people to interact and learn together; (f) Land planning of recreational day use areas and other public gathering and discovery spaces as well as Visitor Orientation and Learning facilities; (g) Producing designs for unique and sensitive environments which are integrated into the environment; and, (h) Energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.  Provide the specific project name, construction cost, point of contact, phone number, email and key personnel for those projects profiled under this category.  A minimum of five projects are desired and no more than ten will be reviewed. Include a representative floor plan, site plan, building section, or other appropriate drawing, and a minimum of two photographs must be included for each project.

The Board will examine and note the offerors’ organizational structure, approach and philosophy regarding construction management of small to medium construction projects (e.g. $100,000 to 50 million) with complex demands.  The Board will examine the offeror’s experience with design and/or construction management projects where community members, fundraising specialists/donors/board member, non profits, and/or diverse stakeholders had meaningful involvement in the process.  Please provide the specific project name, construction cost, point of contact, phone number, email and key personnel for two projects under this category.  

The Board will examine the offeror’s ability to produce notable and distinctive architecture while working within a design guideline framework.  Please provide the specific project name, construction cost, point of contact, phone number, email and key personnel for two projects under this category.  Include at least two photographs for each project.  The Board will investigate AutoCAD and design presentation software capabilities.  Responses should include software name, version and number and/or names of skilled operators on the team.  The Board will evaluate the scope of experience with the types of work and disciplines noted in the attached Statement of Work Document.

Evaluation Factor 2 – Proximity Factor 
The Board shall consider the geographic proximity for coordination and communication with key Forest Service staff, and the offeror’s knowledge of locality.  It is expected that the majority of the work under this solicitation will be for the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (SMNRA), Las Vegas.  The remaining work load may include locations throughout the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.  Consequently, a geographic location preference will be given for Las Vegas, Nevada and surrounding area (50 mile radius).  Scoring for the proximity factor will apply to office/key personnel locations for the lead architect-engineer firm and the construction management firm.  Other consultants that are part of the offerors team which would have an incidental role in meeting contract requirements (e.g., interpretative exhibit design, specialty technical experts, etc.) may be located outside of the geographic area without affecting the proximity score. 

The offeror should demonstrate knowledge of geological features (e.g. desert and mountain environments) climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique to the Las Vegas area and experience with local government organizations, regulations, laws and unique criteria associated with the construction climate in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. The offeror should demonstrate general knowledge of geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are typical to National Forest locations within the remainder of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.

Evaluation Factor 3 – Professional Qualifications 
The Selection Board will evaluate the education, training, registrations, professional certificates, awards, peer recognition, overall and relevant experience, and longevity of the key management and personnel with the offeror:  The Board will consider the level of education of the staff in the disciplines needed to successfully complete the work.  The Board will consider the availability of professionals with appropriate training in specialized subjects such as energy savings and energy modeling, building inspection services, new technologies and systems, environmentally sensitive design, construction techniques appropriate for the setting/locations, development of infrastructure and recreational sites, etc., as appropriate to support the development of the work of the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area and other National Forest locations within the Intermountain Region.  The Board will consider the offeror’s depth and breadth of staff with LEED (Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design) Accreditation as defined by the US Green Building Council.  The Board will consider the depth and disciplines on staff who are professionally registered Engineers, Architects, and Surveyors, etc. The designers or project managers in each discipline and surveyors must be registered in the state(s) services are proposed.  The Board will consider overall and relevant experience.  Relevant experience includes A-E work typical with that encountered in the Forest Service (e.g., visitor centers, interpretative and education facilities, campgrounds, play spaces, administrative offices, etc.) and A-E experience with federal land management agencies.  The Board will consider the longevity of key staff involved with the offeror and the offeror’s subcontractors, indicative of the stability and continuity of each offeror’s practice.

Evaluation Factor 4 – Past Performance  
The Board will evaluate the past performance on design services and construction management on contracts of similar size and scope.  The Board will examine the documented past performance of the Offeror and Subcontractors in the Government’s PPIRS site, (The Past Performance Information Retrieval System) a government database for Civilian Agencies.  The Board will evaluate the design quality, timeliness and cost controls implemented in projects of similar size (e.g. $100,000 to $50 million) and scope (described in Factor 2) in the public and/or private sector.  Provide a list of four projects with the project name, description, award price, final price, client name and contact information.  Include similar information on construction management projects.  The Board will examine the trend of repeat business with clients, which suggests strong long-term relationships. Please provide the specific project name, point of contact, phone number, email for three past clients to verify successful performance of the proposed Offeror.  The Board will compare the list of personnel involved in successful projects with the proposed team for the contract.  The availability of successful professionals with proven track records will be a key factor in the selection of a submission.

Evaluation Factor 5 – Capacity to Accomplish the Work 
Provide a brief narrative regarding the size of the firms (prime and subcontractors), current workload (number of projects and dollar value), and ability to absorb additional work.  The Board will consider an offeror's experience with similar size projects and the available capacity of key disciplines when evaluating the capacity of a offeror to perform the work. The board will consider the full potential value of any current contracts that a offeror has been awarded when evaluating capacity.  The Board will evaluate evidence of the success of long term relationships between the offeror’s proposed team (prime and subconsultants) which suggests the ability to work together and accomplish successful projects. An exhibit illustrating past projects where the multiple firms of the offerors team have worked together should be submitted to assist the agency in understanding this element. 

Evaluation Factor 6 – Oral Interview 
Oral interviews will be required in the second stage of evaluations for the short-listed firms notified by the government.  This factor is included in this synopsis for information only and is not to be included in the submissions to this synopsis posting.  Interviews will be conducted with the offerors determined to be the most qualified based on evaluation of SF-330’s and Evaluation Factors 1-5.  Interviews will be conducted with a minimum of three offerors and no more than six offerors.  Interviews will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, and will last no longer than two hours.  Offerors should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation factors and demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  The key project staff from the offeror’s team (prime and subconsultants) should attend the interview, up to ten persons.  Emphasis will be placed on the lead designer/engineer-A/E team’s understanding of the unique aspects of the SMNRA Middle Kyle Complex project, their design philosophy, project management process, and quality assurance processes.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract entitled MAG-PLAN Modification:  New Data Collection, Testing, and Streamlining of OCS Economic Impact Model for Alaska (Short Title:  MAG PLAN Alaska Upgrade Study).  The MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement type contract for the effort described herein but may consider other proposed types if determined appropriate.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, and the work is multi-disciplinary.   The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described below.  The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to be not more than 24 months.
BACKGROUND:  The MMS is responsible for managing Federal energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), which extends from the edge of State waters to the limits of the Exclusive Economic Zone.  The MMS uses the OCS Economic Impact Model called MAG-PLAN Alaska to estimate the onshore economic impacts of natural gas and oil exploration, development, and production activities on the Alaska OCS.   The purpose of this procurement is to upgrade MAG-PLAN Alaska, which was developed for in-house MMS use.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  MAG-PLAN Alaska is a Microsoft Access-based 2-stage input-output model using IMPLAN multipliers to estimate employment, personal income, and similar economic impacts from OCS activities.  MMS develops Exploration & Development Scenarios containing estimates of the level of exploration, development, and production anticipated from a proposed OCS lease sale or set of lease sales, and these scenarios are the essential input for MAG-PLAN.
SCOPE OF WORK:  The objective of the MAG-PLAN Alaska Upgrade Study is to strengthen and refine the Bureaus procedures for estimating the onshore economic effects of OCS-related activities by improving the current version of MAG-PLAN.  MMS seeks professionals with expertise in applied regional economic impact analysis and oil and gas engineering and/or project cost modeling and analysis, to (1) update and refine existing industry expenditure data, especially for the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, North Aleutian Basin, and Cook Inlet planning areas; (2) refine the methodology used to distribute industry expenditures to onshore locations and sectors; (3) incorporate recent advances in oil-&-gas-related technology and changes to industry practices; (4) refine and test MAG-PLAN software to eliminate weaknesses and increase user-functionality; (5) revise the industry sectors to reflect recent changes in the IMPLAN sectoring scheme; and (6) improve/update the model documentation.  
HOW TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT:  If you are interested in participating in this acquisition, please send your organizations name, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address and DUNS Number via email to caroline.laikin@mms.gov, by 1:00 p.m. Friday, June 26, 2009.

<DESC>THIS PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009.  This pre-solicitation notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704.  

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Metallurgy Division, Materials Performance Group, has a requirement for the purchase of a high-strain rate tensile test system and a strain measurement system based on digital image correlation.  The purchase shall include all required equipment, and installation and training for the system.

NIST conducts research into the constitutive properties of engineering materials.  One component of that research measures material properties at high deformation rates.  These properties include strength, ductility and fracture behavior. Potential materials are as diverse as automotive sheet metals like aluminum and high-strength steel, pipeline and bridge steels, and ceramic armor.  The data generated are used for simulating machining and forming operations, evaluating automotive crash-worthiness, and predicting failure and reliability of infrastructure materials under extreme conditions such as earthquakes, fires, and explosions. 

The required system will complement the existing high-rate test facility (NIST Kolsky Bar) for determining the constitutive properties of metals at elevated strain rates.  The strain rates in question, 10 1/s<de/dt<400 1/s, lie between the quasi-static and the very high rate, which are regions where NIST already has test capability.  

The required system will fill that gap in test capability.  
The NAICS code for this requirement is 334519 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is being procured using full & open competition.  This requirement is not set-aside for small business.

Delivery terms shall be FOB DESTINATION.  The period of performance shall be stated in the request for quotation.  

Simplified Acquisition Procedures shall be utilized under the authority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-09-RQ- 0315.

Potential offerors will be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted.  It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation; the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list.  Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.

Offerors shall be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration website at www.ccr.gov, in order to be eligible to receive a contract under this acquisition.

NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this notice.

One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreements and Free Trade Agreements.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health intends to negotiate and award a modification on a noncompetitive basis for continuation of services under current purchase order HHSN271200800620P.  The services are increased in order to complete the NIMH protocol project under NCT00298246/06M0102.  Emory Genetics Laboratory (EGL) will perform Array CGH – EmArray Cyto6000 testing and analysis for patients treated with autism.  The test will include the hybridization of DNA analyses is isolated from peripheral blood to a custom array containing oligonucleotide clones across the genome for detection of any abnormal findings.  The period of performance is also extended by 60 days.

The protocol study shall provide the interrelationship between behavioral and medical profiles in children with autism. The study shall conduct a longitudinal natural history study of an addititional 50 children with autism. There are two types of study regressive and non-regressive groups from 12-84 months of age at study entry in order to capture regression. The systematic prospective evaluations will be utilized in order to provide validation to the phenomenon of regression in autism, determine diagnostic and functional outcomes, and evaluate behavioral, medical and immunologic functioning.  Specific aims include. 1. To characterize and validate the regressive phenotype in children with autism. 2. To characterize the immune response in children with autism. 3. To identify neurobiologic markers for autism through the techniques of neurophysiology, anatomy, metabolomics, proteomics and genomics (e.g. gene expression profiles).  The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.

<DESC><p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) seeks to procure on a sole source basis one&nbsp;(1) PatchPro and one (1)&nbsp;Slice Recording Chamber Kit with Scientifica, Brambleside, Bell brook Industrial Estate, Uckfield, East Sussex, TN22 1QQ., UK. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.5 01-(a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 333298 and the business size standard is 500 employees. <br />The NINDS Synaptic Function Section (SFS) has a goal to study the molecular mechanism underlying neurotransmitter release and its modulation. The SFS relies on a combination of techniques and equipment to conduct research. SFS scientists frequently rely on electrophysiology techniques to study electrical activity in neurons and biological tissue and need to acquire new equipment with which to conduct these studies. The PatchPro 1000 and slice recording chamber kit combined with an upright microscope, the Olympus BX51WI, will provide the state-of-the-art electrophysiology workstation SFS requires for the experiments.<br />It has been determined that the PatchPro 1000, developed by Scientifica, best meets the SFS's needs. The PatchPro 1000 is the only system that includes the essential "pipette follow" option. This feature allows the user to link all integrated motorized manipulators with the movement of the stage. The PatchPro 1000 is the only one which includes a simple to use graphical interface ("GI", LinLab). This interface permits integration of a computer driven temperature control system which can be set and measured at both the chamber and heater. This temperature system is only integrated within the graphical interface and allows a text record of temperature throughout the duration of the experiment. Other systems do not integrate within the GI of the complete workstation in this way or record temperature as a text file. Another unique feature of this workstation is that each manipulator and microscope stage is independently controlled; the speed, acceleration, and deceleration can be set independently. In addition, each item provides feedback to the GI showing its XYZ position. Each of these items can be moved via the software with either a "virtual joystick" or with "fixed steps" at the click of a mouse. Fixed step jumps can be as small as 1 micron or as large as 20 millimeters. The PatchPro can use a control cube, pad style design or joystick. The manipulators in the system offer 4 axis of movement with 22 mm of travel in all four axes and as "fine" and "fast" control. Finally, the Scientifica workstation's manipulators can be homed in or out at the push of a button. The PatchPro allows an important "home in" offset which is a function that minimizes the amount of broken pipettes when using the convenient home in/out function. The PatchPro system allows up to 12 units to be integrated via the software. Each item can be selected via its' own tab within the software. The software, installation and warranty offered on the PatchPro 1000 are only available through Scientifica. <br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NINDS to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the Office of Acquisitions, NIDA, on or before 3:00 PM ET June 25, 2009. All questions must be in writing and can be emailed to Liem T Nguyen at ln18x@nih.gov or faxed to 301-480-1358 on or before June 24, 2009. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference announcement number NOI-1096272 on all correspondence.</p>

The contractor will produce a single, compiled geologic map of the entire SAMO unit based upon new mapping where necessary and the compilation of existing maps of the same scale that may already be published.  Inconsistencies among published and new maps must be rectified with seamless edge matching provided in the finished product.  
Additionally, the park experiences recurring landslides that impact park natural resources and infrastructure.  The contractor will provide a compiled landslide map database that seamlessly covers the entire park and depicts landslides that have been previously mapped by the California Geologic Survey and others on the fourteen 7 1/2 minute quadrangles that comprise the park.  These maps may be generated through interpretation of landforms as observed on maps, aerial photographs, and in the field. Each landslide on these maps must be described in terms of its activity, type, confidence of interpretation, direction of movement, and estimated thickness. 
An accuracy assessment (peer review) must be conducted to validate the final maps. 
Period of Performance for the entire project (all quadrangles mapped) is 24  months from award. 
Final map products will include: "	Digital geologic map, preferably in ESRI ArcGIS 9.x or latest version; personal geodatabase (.mdb) for each digital geologic-GIS map with a Geologic Unit Information table and Source Map Information table, where applicable.  At a minimum, all geologic features present on the published map(s) are present as GIS data, and are fully attributed shape files to standards as identified in Part I d of the USGS-NCGMP 2004 STATEMAP program announcement No. 04hQPA0003"	Accompanying text and graphics containing map explanatory information, "	A description of map units; "	A stratigraphic column depicting stratified units;"	Where applicable, a correlation diagram showing age relationships of map units;"	An explanation of map symbols; and"	FGDC compliant metadata for all files developed.
These may be delivered via CD-ROM or by file transfer protocol (ftp), or some other suitable agreed upon electronic medium.

<DESC>Rental of Excel Modular Scaffolding for use at Point Loma.  Brand Name Mandatory.  FOB Destination.  Specifications will be listed in the Solcitation.  Solicitation to be issued in the next few days.
 	IDENTIFICATION OF AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:  The requiring activity is the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, NH  03801.  The contracting activity is the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS) Annex, Contracts Division, Portsmouth, NH  03801.
NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF CONTRACT ACTION:  This is a brand name mandatory action to be awarded under commercial acquisition practices utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Bartlet Services, Plymouth, MA.  The placement of a firm, fixed price order is anticipated.
IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.
DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF ACQUISITION:  The proposed requirement is to rent Excel Modular Scaffolding for the SSN767 in Point Loma, CA that will supplement a significant amount of modular scaffolding equipment already owned by Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS).  Modular scaffolding fits together quickly and can be adjusted to accommodate angles and adapted to other variations needed at the worksite.  However, the way in which it fits together is peculiar from one manufacturer to another.  Excel Modular Scaffolding cannot be mixed with another manufacturer, such as Bil-Jax, or vice versa.  
In order to support the increased amount of ship maintenance, PNS has been tasked with performing the overhaul at Point Loma, CA.  The shipyard's inventory does not meet the scaffolding requirements for the SSN767.

<DESC>The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) Office of Inspector General (OIG) plans to contract for an audit of the RRB’s Financial Interchange, a financing arrangement that funds certain benefit payments under the Railroad Retirement Act.  The OIG anticipates awarding a fixed price contract.

The RRB is an independent agency in the executive branch of the Federal government.  Its primary function is to administer comprehensive retirement-survivor and unemployment-sickness insurance benefit programs for the nation's railroad workers and their families.  The Financial Interchange is a collective term that describes a series of legally mandated periodic fund transfers between the RRB and the Social Security Administration, the RRB and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the RRB and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury).

The Financial Interchange is required by statute.  Section7(c)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act, as amended requires an annual determination of the amount of that would place the Social Security and Federal Hospital Insurance trust funds in the same position in which they would have been if service as an employee after December 31, 1936, covered under the RRA, had been included in the term 
“employment” as defined in the Social Security act and in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act.  The Financial Interchange is a complex statistical projection designed to comply with the foregoing statutory requirement.  The calculation is performed annually by the Financial Interchange Division of the RRB’s Bureau of the Actuary.  In FY 2008, the RRB’s net cost of operations exceeded $10 billion of which $3.6 billion (36%) was financed by the Financial Interchange.

Interested parties may obtain more information about the RRB’s programs and financing from the RRB’s public website www.rrb.gov.  The available information includes descriptions of the agency’s organization and programs as well as financial and actuarial reports.  A copy of the "Summary and Documentation" for the 56th Deterimination of the Financial Interchange for Fiscal Year 2007 is available only upon request via return EMAIL Interested parties may request a copy by EMAIL to ljay@oig.rrb.gov.

The OIG anticipates issuing Solicitation No. RRB09R006 on or about June 26, 2009. This solicitation will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO.gov).  Copies of this solicitation and its attachments/exhibits will be available for electronic download via the FBO.gov website.  The OIG does not plan to send out copies of this solicitation via U.S. Mail.  Hardcopies of the solicitation document will not be available.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will be distributed solely through the FBO.gov website.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring FBO.gov to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:tammy.demille@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic (SPAWARSYSCENLANT)intends to award a sole source contract to DefenseWeb Technologies (DWT) toprovide hosting, system enhancements, maintenance, data, and trainingsupport to multiple United States Air Force (USAF) Medical Operations Agency(AFMOA) personnel systems.  This is a one-time contract until these systemscan be stood up in a .mil environment at SPAWARSYSCENLANT New OrleansOffice.  The AFMOA system provides a suite of applications known as theFamily Advocacy Program (FAP) and Special Needs Identification andAssignment Coordination (SNIAC) Program, a "Family of Systems"(FAPNet/SNIAC) to approximately 600 end-users.  The contractor will providethe necessary engineering and technical services needed to support the AFMOAsuite of applications, which include the FAP Network (FAPNet), Family AdvocacySystem of Records (FASOR), New Parent Support Program (NPSP), OutreachPrevention Automated Log (OPAL) and Special Needs Identification andAssignment Coordination (SNIAC) Program.  The FAP and SNIAC programs aremanaged by AFMOA at Lackland AFB, San Antonio, TX, providing policyguidance, standards and necessary program information to staffs at 79 CONUSand OCONUS locations.  Total staffing is approximately 600 with each officeranging in size from 2-15 people.
DWT is the only source capable of providing the maintenance and technicalsupport for the AFMOA suite of applications.  Under previous Air Forcecontractsthe AFMOA applications were developed utilizing a DWT proprietary platformand the government does not possess full user rights to the proprietarycodes.   DWT is the original developer and sole maintainer of the AFMOA suiteof applications.  Since the government does not own the rights to the DWTXtendable Server proprietary code that currently operates the systems, there isno ability to maintain this application and ensure the requirements of theAFMOA program are fulfilled without the continued support of DWT.
DWT is the only firm capable of providing this maintenance support until thesuite of applications can be re-developed to no longer require the use the DWTproprietary Xtendable Server platform.
SPAWARSYSCENLANT NO issued a sole source delivery order to DWT for supportservices that ended in March 2009.  DWT is currently supporting AFMOA as asubcontractor under contracts N69250-07-D-0300 and N00039-04-D-2021.Software maintenance is being procured under yet another contract.  As notedabove, the purpose of this proposed contract is to provide support for thecurrent AFMOA suite of applications while SPAWARSYSCENLANTNO re-designsthe applications so that the DWT proprietary design platforms are no longerrequired for the systems to operate.  After the redesign effort, the governmentwill own the new operating codes and have appropriate intellectual propertyrights to operate and modify the systems as needed.   The development effortis not expected to be completed within the base year of the contract; thereforeone option year is necessary.  A single support contract with DWT will reducegovernment risk of AFMOA program interruption or loss of service and providecost savings by avoiding subcontract pass through costs.

<p>The New Orleans District intends to award to Colorado State University, a sole source firm-fixed priced purchase order for commercial testing of levee armoring products for use in the Greater New Orleans Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS). Testing will require constructing, calibrating and deploying a hydraulic overtopping simulator device within an existing Colorado State University test flume which simulates an overtopping wave by sequential releases of pre-determined volumes of water that have been stored with sufficient potential to replicate both the flow thickness and flow velocity of the overtopping wave volume.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The testing will require observation and measurement of the effects of the simulated wave overtopping on a number of erosion protection materials.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To the extent possible, the testing will conform to protocols and procedures previously established by Colorado State University for steady overflow testing, thus assuring rational and consistent guidelines for both steady and unsteady overtopping flows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The slope protection materials will be prepared in special trays (including grass growth) under the supervision of the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and delivered to the Contractor's site at the Government expense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The overtopping tests will be conducted in such a way to represent a full-scale replica of a levee protected side slope (including a 10-ft wide horizontal crest).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Contractor must provide support in an existing high-discharge test facility for lift-in-trays containing the armoring products to be tested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Overtopping flow shall be controlled using a fixed overtopping wave simulator device, which varies the flow to simulate wave sets at predetermined wave periods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tests are performed by flowing large quantities of water intermittently (to model wave overtopping) over grass, Turf Reinforcement Mats (TRM), and Articulated Concrete Block (ACB) mattresses for six hours (per test) within 2 side by side 6'x 40' steel trays supported inside an existing wide concrete flume that has sufficient length to accommodate the 40-ft-long trays placed on a 1 on 3 slope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This device must be capable of storing sufficient quantities of water such that the full potential energy of the largest (up to 3 cfs/ft) and smallest specified overtopping wave volume can be realized and all volumes in between.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The existing flume will be equipped with a water tank with a sufficient supply of water, that is capable of rapidly draining the entire overtopped water volume and filling before the next wave is simulated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is required that this testing achieve the following goals (1) verify the allowable average wave overtopping criterion of 0.1 cubic feet per second per foot (cfs per ft) of levee used for the 100-year design of grass-covered levees, (2) quantify resiliency of grass-covered levees that are subjected to overtopping beyond the 100year design levels, (3) verify the capability of various slope armoring alternatives to survive 500 year design levels, and (4) establish the ultimate design limits for viable armoring alternatives by testing to failure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Criteria for initiation of damage to the slope protection, and progression of damage beyond initial damage due to wave overtopping will be consistent with the criteria developed by Colorado State University for steady overflow tests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Results for these unsteady wave overtopping tests will be correlated to the extent possible with previous Colorado State University steady overflow tests on similar slope coverings and protection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS AND SOURCE FOR SOUGHT COMBINED.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>THERE WILL BE NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING.</p>

These services are generally for use within the Corps of Engineers, South Pacific Division, military and civil boundaries, and for any South Pacific Division customers, as determined by the Contracting Officer. Project work will include subsurface investigations, geophysical and strength testing, materials testing and materials property development, seismicity and seismic parameters, seepage and stability analysis, borrow site investigations to determine suitability of materials, periodic detailed inspections and/or risk assessments of dams or levees, design/construction parameters, designs for dam and levee safety remediation including but not limited to large embankments, floodwalls and channels, insitu densification, seepage and stability berms, impermeable blankets, cutoff walls, subsurface drainage systems, relief wells, development of methods to mitigate for seismic activity, design of dewatering systems, development of construction plans and specifications (SPECSINTACT), e.g. design alternatives, quantities, plans, cost estimates(M-CACES), and instructions to field personnel are also important elements of the proposed contract. Capabilities in other disciplines, such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Computer Aided Drafting Design (CADD) are important elements of the proposed contract. This work will include all Architectural-Engineering (A-E) and related services necessary to complete the assigned task orders for studies and designs. The end result of these projects will be design. A specific scope of work and services will be issued with each task order. This procurement will be conducted under FSC Code: C219; SIC Code: 8711; NAICS Code: 541330. The size standard for this code is $4,500,000.00. To be considered a Small Business under this NAICS Code, the respondents average revenue for the last three fiscal years cannot be more than $4,500,000.00. This announcement is open to all firms regardless of size. Up to two contracts will be negotiated and will be awarded within one year after the required response date to this announcement. Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts will be negotiated and the first one is anticipated to be awarded in November 2009. The contract will be for a maximum of a one-year base period from the date of award and will contain options to extend 4 additional one-year periods. The contract amount for the base period and any option will not exceed $4,900,000 for each period. The total contract amount shall not exceed $24,500,000. The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government. At the discretion of the Government, the option year may be exercised early if the Total Estimated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted. If the option is exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the contract award date, or the anniversary of exercising an option, the new option year rates will take effect on the anniversary date of the contract award. If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within the years 12 month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimated Price of the option period contract amount. At the discretion of the Government, if an option year is exercised early and unused capacity is rolled over, the Government may extend the period of service to coincide with the anniversary date of that period. The minimum guarantee for the base year of the contract will be $98,000. Since more than one contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows: (1) All awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $2,500.   (2)  In making selection of the awardee to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer will consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of previous task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost control, the firms strength and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic location described in the statement of work for each task order.  Details of the selection process will be included in the resultant contracts.  All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR Sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged business.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to employees office location (not the location of the work).  If a large business firm is selected for one of these contracts, it will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan at a later date.  A detailed plan is not required to be submitted with the SF 330; however, the plans to do so should be specified in block H of the SF 330.  If a large business is selected it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement to subcontract.  Sacramento Districts recommended goal for work intended to be subcontracted is 70% for small business.   The goal further states that of the 70% to be subcontracted to small business, 6.2% is for small disadvantaged business (subset to small business), 7.0% is for small business/woman owned (subset to small business), 9.8% for HUBZone small business (subset to small business), 3.0% for veteran-owned small business and 0.9% is for service-disabled veteran-owned small business (subset to small business).     If the selected firm submits a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale of why the above goals are not met.     Firms should indicate personnel and subcontracts selected to work on the contract and state their management structure. To be eligible for contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the Internet Site at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/scripts/index.html or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414 and complete electronic annual representations and certifications at https://orca.bpn.gov. Contractor Performance Evaluations: In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement. For A-E contracts awarded at or above $30,000.00, the USACE will evaluate contractors performance and prepare a performance report using the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), which is a web-based system. After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days. Accessing and using ACASS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the users computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transaction. The certification software could cost approximately $110-$125 per certificate per year and is purchased from External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendors. Current information about the PKI certification process and for contracting vendors can be found on the web site http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil. If the contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to ACASS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.<BR><BR>2.

<DESC>The Wilmington VA Medical Center, 1601 Kirkwood Highway, Wilmington, DE 19805 intends to issue an Architect and Engineer contract. This project involves all design work and phasing to renovate the East wing of the 5th lfoor of the Wilmington VAMC Hospital. The wing consists of approximately 9700 gross square feet. The corridor is approximately 1930 net sq. ft. and the patient rooms, offices and procedure rooms are approximately net 5067 sq.tf. Part of that is approximately 1000 net sq. ft. of area in the central core which may be included. The remaining space is closets, stairwell, etc. The Design Development phase shall include meetings with VA staff as necessary to fully develop plans and incorporate staffs requirements. NE is to provide meeting minutes for all meetings associated with this project including meetings with VA staff during the Design Development phase.  The East wing of the 5th lfoor presently houses post operative beds for ambulatory surgery, a dialysis unit, and provider and community health offices. The renovation of 5 East will allow Wilmington VAMC to create a state of the art area for the Dialysis Unit. The current space is ill designed and does not allow for proper lfow and efficient delivery of care. Wilmington VAMC will also move one of the specialty clinics, most likely urology, from an area of the Hospital that was at one time an inpatient unit. That will allow maximizing the available space and provide patients aesthetically pleasing, state of the art specialty services and procedure rooms. The A/E is to plan all phasing in coordination with the Hospital staff necessary to move the remaining functions to accommodate the construction work. Some services may occupy the wing during construction. The primary service which will occupy the renovated space is Dialysis. Other services which currently occupy the wing and will need to be accommodated after Urology and Dialysis on a space available basis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541310.  The U.S. Small Business Administration size standard is $4,5000,000.00.  The SOLICITATION issue date will be approximately June 27, 2009 with an approximate response date of July 27, 2009.  The solicitation is a Request for Proposal and will be issued as a 100% Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside.

<DESC>A.	General Information  

The Southwest Region will be standardizing Sterilization Indicators & Controls - Chemical.  This is a re-evaluation of this product group.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs’ needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes indicator strips, bowie-dick type tests, integrator packs, tapes in widths of ¾” and 1” with and without dispensers for wrapped trays, attest kits and smart packs for Vacuum-Assisted and Gravity Displacement Steam Sterilization processes.  The entire category of Sterilization Indicators & Controls - Chemical has an annual demand of over $80,000.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, Cardinal, currently serving the Southwest Region. 

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit’s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program and obtaining a DAPA please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is November 2009.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

B.	Products & Performance Required
 
The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of  Sterilization Indicators & Controls - Chemical.  The product category includes indicator strips, bowie-dick type tests, integrator packs, tapes in widths of ¾” and 1” with and without dispensers for wrapped trays, attest kits and smart packs for Vacuum-Assisted and Gravity Displacement Steam sterilization processes.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $80,000.  This is a re-evaluation of this product group.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  

At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	Evaluation Criteria

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.
Vendors will be required to provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and product literature. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

5.	Vendors must provide a statement indicating their products/packaging related to this product line is latex-safe/free and heavy metal free with the initial submittal.

6.	Vendors MUST provide specific product information (brand, model, cost, etc.) of the proprietary incubator used in response to this RFRIAQ.

7.	Vendors must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Steam Sterilization Indicators – Chemical product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in progress in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified.

8.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV), Cardinal Health for distribution of Steam Sterilization Indicators – Chemical within the Southwest Region.  Vendors whose products are not available through the current regional PV will be disqualified.

9.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.

10.	Vendors must provide a local vendor representative for product implementation and customer servicing as required for the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) within the Southwest Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and email address in response to this RFRIAQ.

11.	Vendor must provide proof of corrective actions(s)/resolution of all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Steam Sterilization Indicators – Chemical product line including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this standardization process. The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this criterion.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this criterion.  

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00PM PDST, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree and 5 = Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The evaluations are conducted in a clinical setting. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the “break”, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria
1.	The chemical steam sterilization indicator product packaging clearly indicates the type of indicator for the type of steam sterilization process.

4.	After complete incubation with control, the chemical indicator and control response can be easily determined for exposure to the sterilization process cycle (No Growth of Chemical Indicator/Growth of Control).
a.	Chemical indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle to assess the sterility of surgical instruments.  Controls must clearly indicate growth of chemical as a comparison.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 3 times.
c.	After process cycle is completed and chemical indicator has completed the required incubation period, evaluator will visually inspect the indicator/control for ease of determining appropriate response (No Growth of Indicator/Growth of Control) indicating exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle.

5.	After the sterilization process cycle is completed, the chemical indicators do not easily detach from the sample test wrapped trays and instrument pans.
a.	Chemical indicators must remain securely attached to instrument packs to differentiate processed/unprocessed instrument packs in inventory/storage.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 3 times.
c.	Evaluator will assess for secure attachment of indicators after the completed sterilization process cycle.

6.	After the sterilization process cycle is completed, the indicator (Bowie-Dick type test) response can be easily determined for exposure to the sterilization process cycle (pack load).

b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 3 times.
c.	Before pack load is sterilized, the chemical indicator is placed in the pack load according to manufacturer’s guidelines/instructions.  After process cycle is completed, evaluator will visually inspect the indicator for ease of determining exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle.

7.	After the sterilization process cycle is completed, the chemical integrator indicator response can be easily determined as Safe/Sterile or Unsafe/Unsterile for sample test wrapped trays and instrument pans.
a.	Chemical integrator indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle to assess the sterility of surgical instruments.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 3 times.
c.	Before the sample test wrapped tray and instrument pan is sterilized, the chemical integrator indicator is place inside sample test tray/pan according to manufacturer’s guidelines/instructions.  After process cycle is completed, evaluator will visually inspect the indicators for ease of determining successful exposure to the sterilization process cycle.

Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 3 times.
c.	Evaluator will place the biological indicator in the pack load according to manufacturer’s guidelines/instructions before it is sterilized.  After process cycle is completed, evaluator will visually inspect the indicator for ease of determining exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle.

3.	After complete incubation with control, the biological indicator and control response can be easily determined for exposure to the sterilization process cycle (No Growth of Biological Indicator/Growth of Control).
a.	Biological indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle to assess the sterility of surgical instruments.  Controls must clearly indicate growth of biological as a comparison.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 3 times.
c.	After process cycle is completed and biological indicator has completed the required incubation period, evaluator will visually inspect the indicator/control for ease of determining appropriate response (No Growth of Indicator/Growth of Control) indicating exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle.

Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

<DESC><p>The Department of Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Department of Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is conducting market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition regulation (FAR) Part 10. This request for information (RFI) is being posted to obtain information from vendors with the interest, proven expertise and experience in the application of tax gap and econometric analyses of federal excise tax losses due to tobacco and alcohol diversion/smuggling. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. This is not a request for a proposal. This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. all firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that the response is not a request that will be considered for contract award. All interested parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately fromtheir response to this sources sought notice.
<p>The information being requested is for planning purposes only. The Government does not intend to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested. TTB will assess the ability of the market to meet the needs as stated above based on the information received. Upon receipt of the requested information, the Government may request additional information to confirm the respondents' capability. The vendor must identify their business size classification (ex. SDVOSB or HUBZone), as well as, provide any available contract vehicles, such as a GSA Schedule. Dependent upon the results of this market survey and other information obtained by the Government, BPD on behalf of TTB may subsequently issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to acquire the DNA analyses as mentioned above.</p>
<p><br />Background:<br />TTB regulates the alcohol beverage and tobacco products and their industries in the USA. TTB has developed methodologies to estimate the amount of Federal excise tax loss for alcohol and tobacco products due to illicit trade. Prior to completion of the methodologies, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 ("CHIPRA", Public Law 111-3), was enacted and requires that a study be conducted concerning the magnitude of tobacco smuggling in the United States, to include the loss of Federal tax receipts and the role of imported tobacco products involved in illicit trade. This study must be submitted to Congress by February 4, 2010. In an effort to meet the statutory deadline, TTB will first conduct a gap analysis study to determine the extent of the diversion problem/excise tax loss for tobacco. We will also follow with an econometric model analysis on tobacco tax loss from the diversion of cigarettes; so that we can compare results of the two methodologies and fine tune our estimates.</p>
<p>Scope of Work <br />The contractor shall conduct four reviews on separate TTB studies, using: (1) gap analysis to estimate tobacco excise tax loss, (2) econometric analysis to estimate tobacco excise tax loss, (3) gap analysis to estimate alcohol excise tax loss, and (4) econometric analysis to analyze alcohol excise tax loss. In conducting these reviews, the contractor shall also analyze and comment upon the proposed methodology, data sets and findings for each study. Due to the CHIPRA requirements, the tobacco tax gap analysis study will be completed in its entirety first.</p>
<p>The Government would like to conduct a similar study for alcohol excise tax losses. The Government recognizes that the study of tobacco tax loss, when applied to a different commodity (alcohol) will be different due to social and economic factors.</p>
<p>The Objective<br />The objective of this task is for the Contractor to evaluate the methodologies for the tobacco and alcohol studies, calculation and analysis to determine if they are sufficiently designed to estimate the amount of excise tax lost due to illicit trade. This will include three phases for the tobacco methodology and alcohol methodology.</p>
<p>Phase 1: A review of the planned methodology to evaluate the validity of the design, quality of data sources, robustness of the methods planned, and appropriateness of the models to estimate Federal excise tax loss due to illicit trade and the strengths and limitations of the overall product.<br />Phase 2: A review at an interim period to determine if based on the data collected, modifications are needed to ensure there are no oversights, omissions or inconsistencies to estimate the amount of Federal excise tax loss due to illicit trade.<br />Phase 3: A review of the final draft report to determine that the analysis was sufficient, strengths and limitations are identified and adequately documented, and is fully supported to publish.</p>
<p>Requirements<br />The contractor must be capable of performing all of the following types of support:</p>
<p>a. Methodology for TTB Tax Gap Estimation - The contractor must be familiar with methods used to estimate tax gaps or to have established expertise and performed research on such topics as tobacco and alcohol.</p>
<p>b. Econometric Analysis - The contractor must have prior experience identifying and using alcohol and tobacco data for econometric and statistical analysis using commercially available data analysis tools, preferably SAS.</p>
<p>c. Familiarity with Center for Disease (CDC) Control Data - The contractor should be familiar with datasets available from the CDC and the scope of activities they contain.</p>
<p><br />Vendors are requested to submit the following information for assessment:</p>
<p>&bull; The capability of the vendor to provide the services described above, their business size based on a NAICS code of 541720 which has a size standard of $7M, and whether or not the vendor has a GSA schedule or other contractual vehicle that can be used to obtain these types of services.</p>
<p>&bull; A short description of experience in dealing with a Tax Gap Analysis and Econometric Analysis.</p>
<p>&bull; A written summary of vendor's past performance as it relates to similar analysis, including the names of three references</p>
<p>&bull; Pricing (ex: labor categories and hourly rates) for these types of services</p>
<p>Dependent upon the results of this market research, Public Debt anticipates issuing a solicitation to acquire these services. Any such solicitation would be based on a performance-based work statement. Please note that no solicitation document is available at this time.</p>
<p>Any questions related to the request for information shall be directed to the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer. No contact shall be made with the TTB staff.</p>
<p>Electronic submissions shall be sent to psb3@bpd.treas.gov no later than June 19, 2009 at 2:00pm EDT. The subject line must contain RFI-TTB-09-0025 BKERN. The following file extensions are not allowable and application materials/data submitted with these extensions cannot be considered:</p>

<DESC><p>Solicitation Number: TOFS-09-S-0012
<p>Notice Type: Sources Sought</p>
<p>Synopsis: Sources Sought Notice for an integrated Governance, Risk and Compliance Application (iGRC)</p>
<p>This is a sources sought notice. This announcement is for market research and preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted in response to this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information requests.</p>
<p>1 Introduction</p>
<p>The Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) was established under the EESA with the specific goal of stabilizing the United States financial system and preventing a systemic collapse. This program is managed by the Office of Financial Stability (OFS), which consists of numerous programs that facilitate restoring the flow of credit to consumers and businesses, and tackling the foreclosure crisis to keep millions of Americans in their homes. For a complete list of programs, please refer to the Treasury's Financial Stability the ability Website:</p>
<p>http://www.financialstability.gov/roadtostability/programs.htm</p>
<p>Additionally, the OFS is comprised of various offices that support the activities of each program. They include the Office of the Assistant Secretary, Risk and Compliance, Finance, Investments, Operations, Chief Counsel, Financial Agent Management, Homeownership Preservation as well as the Capital Purchase Program and the Auto Program.</p>
<p>The Office of Risk and Compliance within OFS is seeking an integrated COTS solution to ensure it addresses risks, controls and compliance in a unified and coordinated manner. Commercial and federal best practices call for a disciplined approach to converge the governance, risk and compliance (GRC) functions. Being a start-up organization it is important to avoid white spaces where information is not exchanged and accountability is not established among the various groups. In such situations, each group develops its own standards, methodologies, and bodies of knowledge and best practices. The obvious problem with overlap is inefficiency as these groups often assess the same issues, wasting resources and management time.</p>
<p>The purpose of the iGRC is to integrate the responsibilities of the various OFS offices with the aim of creating and maintaining a sustainable framework for consistent risk management and performance improvement flows using an enterprise-wide approach that is consistent, repeatable, and measurable. The application is intended to strategically address the expanding scope of business, operational, financial, regulatory, technology and market risks, eliminate redundancies, improve collaboration across groups, assisting with risk management activities, and address regulatory and other inquiries. Also, an integrated GRC solution such as this will help manage risk at a strategic and operational level addressing requirements of the internal (OFS senior management) and external (Special Inspector General for TARP (SIG TARP), GAO, and the Congressional oversight committees) stakeholders.</p>
<p><br />1.1 Overview<br />The purpose of this document is to describe the application requirements of the Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (iGRC) System with the objective of developing an integrated application to address the audit, financial controls, enterprise risk, operational risk, IT governance and compliance. The key objectives of this application are to:<br />&bull; eliminate information silos and redundant data, <br />&bull; address regulatory challenges in a holistic manner, <br />&bull; fulfill OFS enterprise risk management goals. <br />&bull; improve collaboration, and <br />&bull; reduce the time and resource costs associated with responding to queries from multiple sources.</p>
<p>Essentially, this application will enable OFS to break down the walls between audit, risk and compliance requirements and provide expanded value as the software is deployed across the enterprise.</p>
<p>2 High Level Features<br />The features described below outline the desired functionality for the iGRC at a high level (See Attachment 1 for specific application requirements). The following features layout OFS' Office of Risk and Compliance requirements.<br />The application should provide a modular and integrated approach to governance, risk and compliance, enabling OFS to:<br />&bull; Manage risk and compliance to comply with applicable laws and regulations, <br />&bull; Identify the interdependencies between processes, risks and controls that are shared across departments and business units, <br />&bull; Implement a unified and simplified approach to enterprise risk management to reduce redundancy, minimize complexity and maximize efficiency, <br />Specific components of the application should include:</p>
<p>&bull; Enterprise Risk Management: the COTS application should enable OFS to assess strategic risks and objectives across the enterprise, link strategic objectives with enterprise risks, and enhance the decision-making process. In addition, the enterprise risk management functionality should provide a clearer understanding of businesses objectives and associated risks, offer more focused management information, and deliver a better understanding of the trade-offs between risk and reward. In addition, in order to reduce IT-related risks associated with purchasing a GRC application as well as mitigating time-to-delivery risks, the OFS is seeking a CobiT 4.0 framework with a preference towards the newer CobiT 4.1 framework. It is expected that OFS will be able to leverage the CobiT framework and readily adapt their policies and procedures. ISO/IEC 27002 is also an acceptable IT Governance framework if CobiT 4.0 or higher is not adopted.<br />&bull; Compliance: the application should have the ability to manage the costs and complexities associated with adhering to the laws, the regulations and OFS' internal policies and procedures. In addition, it should be able to organize large volumes of content from disparate functional groups and direct the exchange of information between various internal and external stakeholders including regulatory agencies.<br />&bull; Financial Controls: the application should provide accountability and visibility with real time internal controls monitoring and reporting functions. Application should have the ability to streamline documentation and process automation with a flexible framework and allow process and control owners to manage their control environment. <br />&bull; Policies and Procedures: Functionality should include:<br />o Central library of laws/regulations and policies,<br />o Policy lifecycle management ,<br />o Collaborative review and authoring, <br />o Top-down policy risk assessment, <br />o Electronic signatures, <br />o Integrated regulatory content.<br />&bull; Performance measurement and management: The application should be able to monitor performance measurements that assess operational and strategic organizational goals. It must do so in a timely, relevant, and concise manner, for all the relevant decision makers. <br />&bull; Operational Controls: The operational risk management functionality should enable OFS to track and quantify risk, reduce the costs and losses associated with risk, and improve and empower business processes by providing greater accountability. The application should offer a consistent and sustainable framework for identifying and managing operational risks resulting from failed processes, people, systems or external events.<br />&bull; IT Governance: The application should establish the control, risk management and oversight of IT related processes and controls. This includes helping provide oversight of the IT practices, assets and resources to demonstrate that risks are managed and corporate objectives are supported and achieved, ensuring the proper use of IT resources.<br />&bull; Reporting: The application should be able to report performance metrics in a dashboard format and also have the ability to generate production and ad hoc reports as needed by the user- community.</p>
<p>3 Key Design Principles</p>
<p>Treasury is focusing on the following key design principles in structuring a program to meet these needs:<br />&bull; Information security<br />&bull; Scalability<br />&bull; Ease of use<br />&bull; Ease of system modification<br />&bull; Auditability<br />&bull; Cost effectiveness<br />&bull; Quality assurance<br />&bull; Implementation schedule<br />&bull; Portability</p>
<p>4 Stakeholders<br />It is envisioned that various offices will be key users of this application. These offices include the Office of Risk and Compliance, Office of the Chief Operating Officer, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Chief Investment Officer, Office of Chief Counsel, the Middle Office, Program offices such as Capital Purchase Program and the Homeowner Preservation Program.</p>

This is a Sources Sought Notice for the Department of Defense Criminal Investigation Task Force (CITF) to provide investigative case management support. 

BACKGROUND

The Criminal Investigation Task Force (CITF) has sole responsibility for conducting the investigation of alleged or suspected war crimes, acts of terrorism, and other related offenses committed by non-U.S. citizens against the United States or U.S. personnel. A number of these investigations involve individuals who had actively participated in the planning and execution of attacks against our homeland.

The CITF is responsible for and is currently involved in providing legal documentation (as the holder of official government record of investigation), as demanded by U.S. court order for habeas and discovery requests to support prosecution of identified terrorists by military tribunal or US federal courts. As with any criminal investigation, as it transitions to trial and prosecution of an offender, the integrity of testimonial, documentary and physical evidence is critical to the judiciary process.

Description: 	Capability of extending the HL7 SPL standard to include the data elements required for food and medical device product facility registration and food and medical device product listing data for processing, reviewing, and archiving by FDA.	       	

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small business (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantage businesses, HUB Zone businesses; veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is being posted for fact finding and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an Invitation for Bid, a Request for Proposal, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items or services herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this source sought. Any response received will not be used as a proposal. 

No official solicitation currently exists in connection to this request for information (RFI).  Also, if in the future an official solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this RFI will be included on the source list. 

**QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE ENTERTAINED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE**

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), Division of Acquisition Operations (DAO) is seeking to identify sources with capabilities and prior experience in extending the HL7 SPL standard to include the data elements required for food and medical device product facility registration and food and medical device product listing data for processing, reviewing, and archiving by FDA. 

Objective: 

In support of the FDA Product Quality Compliance Business Review Board’s Harmonized Inventory project, which was approved by the Bioinformatics Board, a health and regulatory data standard to be utilized by industry to generate food facility registration and food product listing information files for submission to FDA is needed. In the spirit of harmonization, the Structured Product Labeling (SPL) standard should also be extended to accommodate medical device product files for submission to FDA. One of the purposes of the Harmonized Inventory project is to create a reliable, complete, up-to-date, master inventory of FDA-related firms, facilities and products, and their associated information.  

As of July 2008, FDA began receiving electronic drug establishment registration and drug listing data.  The HL7 SPL standard is the data standard which permits the capture of content of labeling, drug establishment registration and drug listing data in a format that FDA can process, review, and archive.  The centralized storage of this standardized data, which will include food facility registration and food product data, in the Agency’s HL7 RIM-based database permits the tracking of registered facilities which manufacture multiple types of regulated products and the product-component/ingredient data.  Standardization of the data will also assist in the improvement of the accuracy, validation, capturing, and integration of regulatory data as well as the facilitation of design of reporting and analytical tools.

Food facility registration and food and medical device product listing SPL documents submitted to the FDA need to undergo quality control to ensure that the data conform to SPL XML schema and FDA business rules.   A Schematron document will be utilized to validate the data submitted in food facility registration and food and medical device product listing SPL documents to ensure conformance with the SPL schema and FDA business validation procedures.

An implementation guide is needed by the FDA-regulated foods and medical device industry to create SPL files for submission to FDA.  This implementation guide is an HL7 document that is used by industry and SPL software developers who create HL7 SPL messages with food and medical device facility registration and product listing data for submission to FDA.

The foods and medical device product industry and FDA employees will need to view the data in foods SPL documents submitted to FDA.  SPL documents, which are XML documents can be rendered and displayed in hypertext markup (HTML) or XHTML language using an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT).  XSLT is the language that can be utilized to transform XML document into HTML or XHTML documents.  The SPL XSLT stylesheet specifies the default font, indentation, orientation, formatting, word wrapping, line spacing, and other properties that will be used for the display of product information submitted in SPL format.

A contractor would be required to extend the HL7 SPL standard to include the data elements required for food and medical device product facility registration and food and medical device product listing data for processing, reviewing, and archiving by FDA.  This contractor would also possess the capability of developing and maintaining an open source Schematron 1.5 document based on the business rules and data relationships for food facility registration and product data and medical device data defined by FDA which, when processed through an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transform (XSLT), XForms, can be used to assist in quality control by validating a SPL file and producing a report outlining the detected errors.  The organization must also be able to generate a HL7 SPL implementation guide to be utilized by industry and SPL software developers to generate valid regulatory submissions for processing, reviewing, and archiving by FDA and software to create the aforementioned documents respectively.  Company would create an implementation guide for the creation of SPL for a specific product and instructions on the use of extensible mark up language (XML).  

The FDA anticipates using a labor hour type contract with a base and two (2) option years for these services.  The NAICS code is 541712.

<DESC>The Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO) has requested the Los Alamos SiteOffice tofund contract number DE-AC52-06NA25396 with Los Alamos National Security(LANS)LLC in the amount of $10.029 million (80% of the total allocation).  Theremaining 20% of the total allocation is planned to be obligated with costauthority in fiscal year 2010.LANS will fund CBFOs requirement with the Los Alamos National Laboratory(LANL) -Carlsbad to accelerate work and disposition of specific inventoryofTRU waste related to the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA).Specific accomplishments include:     Characterization and disposition of CH and RH TRU waste currently inlarge waste containers and CH and RH TRU waste drums from SRS (cleanuplegacyTRU waste at SRS South Carolina)     Characterization and disposition of legacy TRU waste stored at fourlargequantity sites in addition to SRS (i.e. Hanford [Washington], INL [Idaho],LANL[New Mexico], and ORNL [Tennessee] to support footprint reduction.     Near-Term completion of TRU waste cleanup and footprint reduction atsmall quantity sites (e.g.  LLNL, LBNL, and GEVNC [California], NTS[Nevada],SNL [New Mexico], ANL [Illinois], BAPL [Pennsylvania], etc) throughshipment toINL for waste certification prior to final shipment to WIPP for disposal. The scope of work to accelerate the targeted TRU waste is as follows:     Characterization and certification of large-sized containers of CHTRUwaste and accelerated characterization and certification of remaining drumsofCH and RH TRU waste at SRS.     Modification of WIPP site infrastructure to maintain the capabilitytotransport, receive, and process TRU waste and support accelerated TRU wastereceipt.     Retrieval, repackaging and/or remediation of targeted TRU waste, asnecessary, to support accelerated TRU waste disposition across the TRUwastecomplex.     Accelerated characterization and certification of CH and RH TRU wastewith a focus on difficult waste at targeted TRU waste sites to supportnear-term site cleanup and footprint reduction milestones/goals.     Increased transportation resources to support accelerated TRU wastedisposition across the complex.The CBFO Recovery Act Project implements the purpose of the AmericanRecoveryand Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) to make use of supplementalappropriationsfor job preservation and creation to accelerate the disposition ofdefense-generated TRU waste across the nation.  The CBFO Recovery ActProject,entitled TRU Waste Accelerated Disposition involves the accelerated TRUwastecharacterization, certification and transportation for disposition ofdefense-generated TRU waste from the following targeted generator andinterimstorage sites above and beyond the currently-approved CBFO baseline projectusing ARRA funds.LANL-Carlsbad is a non-profit Federally Funded Research and DevelopmentCorporation (FFRDC) that meets CBFO s long-term research and developmentofcharacterization and disposal of TRU waste which cannot be met aseffectivelyby existing in-house or contractor resources.  CBFOs requirements forscientific and engineering effort from LANL-Carlsbad vary and are subjecttochange of the focus of performance changes in completing the aforementionedaccelerated activities.  Oversight of Activity Based Cost (ABC) sheets andreview and modification budget performance will occur to meet theacceleratedschedule to assure proper use of federal funds in meeting this criticalmission.

<DESC>Procurement action is currently being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission intends to award a sole source contract to Hewitt Associates, LLC for the administration of the SEC’s Supplemental Health Benefits Program (SHBP) for employee dental and vision benefit plans.  The SEC competitively awarded a contract (SECHQ1-04-C-0142) to Hewitt Associates on April 5, 2004.   Because current industry standards dictate that the “benefit plan year” begins on the calendar year, rather than the Government's fiscal year, it is the SEC’s intent to extend the current contract with Hewitt Associates through December 31, 2009, concurrent with its effort to compete a successor contract (See RFP# SECHQ1-09-R-0076.).  The resultant contract will be awarded prior to the beginning of the 2010 benefit plan year, enabling the transition and implementation period of a successor contractor, if required.   The period of performance for this award is August 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009.  Hewitt Associates is the only known source with the capability required by the SEC to ensure continuity of services, alleviating the risk of disruption of benefits to the SEC employees.  The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only and is not a request for competitive bids. No solicitation will be issued for this sole source requirement and no other information will be provided.

<CONTACT>Jennifer A. Defino, Phone 301-492-3637, Fax 301-492-3437, Email Jennifer.DeFino@nrc.gov - Meghan Nagle, Phone 301-492-3486, Fax 301-492-3437, Email Meghan.Nagle@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole source purchase order with Operation Technology, Inc., to purchase an additional user license for the existing Electrical Transient Analysis Program (ETAP) network WAN and to purchase maintenance and support services to cover the existing ETAP network WAN and the additional user.  This software will be used by the NRC to perform confirmatory analysis of electrical distribution systems at nuclear power plants.    

In accordance with NRC regulations, 10 CFR 50, Appendix B, nuclear utilities are required to perform analyses of the electrical distribution systems installed in nuclear power plants in order to revise their license design basis.  Performance of this analysis requires the use of computer simulation models.  Approximately 88% of the U.S. nuclear power plants use the ETAP software for the analyses of their electrical distribution systems.  In order for the NRC to make independent in-house assessments of the accuracy of the applicant’s analysis, the NRC staff must use identical software to the nuclear power plant (i.e. ETAP).  Therefore, the NRC must use ETAP to perform confirmatory analysis of electrical distribution systems at nuclear power plants.  Operation Technology, Inc. is the only organization that distributes and provides maintenance services for the ETAP software.  

The period of performance of this effort is July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010.  

Requests for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

A determination not to compete this requirement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested parties must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC's needs to Jennifer A. DeFino, Contract Specialist, by e-mail at Jennifer.DeFino@nrc.gov or mail at 11555 Rockville Pike, Mail Stop TWB-01-B10M, Rockville MD 20852, or fax to (301) 492-3437 not later than June 25, 2009. Telephone requests will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>Sybase IQ Software Maintenance for RITA / BTS Enterprise Architecture
<SOLNBR>DTOS59-09-P-00062
<RESPDATE>063009
<ARCHDATE>12312009
<CONTACT>James H Mowery III, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-366-4959, Email james.mowery@dot.gov - James H Mowery III, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-366-4959, Email james.mowery@dot.gov
<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the Bureau of Transportation Research (BTS), within the Research and Special Programs Administration (RITA), within the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT), plans to issue a SOLE-SOURCE contract or delivery order or purchase order to Sybase, Incorporated,  to pay for software maintenance of the items of software listed below.  Such maintenance would cover technical support and updates for the Sybase IQ software, which is a part of the RITA / BTS Enterprise Architecture.  Such maintenance is usually renewed on an annual basis.  RITA / BTS has Internet and Intranet data warehouse applications based on the Sybase IQ database technology and the data warehouse is growing.  Sybase charges an annual maintenance fee for its software, which covers technical support.  There are updates to the software too.  It is considered essential that RITA’s TranStats Program receive the updates to remain up to date with the latest data warehouse technology.  Sybase is the sole manufacturer of Sybase IQ database software, and is the sole provider of maintenance for its Sybase IQ database software.  Sybase is therefore considered to be the only source for this procurement.  The software items to be maintained by Sybase under this procurement are as follows:

1.	SYBASE IQ ENTERPRISE EDT, Platform Sun Solaris, CPY P, CPU N/A, USR N/A, QTY 4, Catalog # 12841
2.	SYBASE IQ ENTERPRISE EDT, Platform Sun Solaris, CPY P, CPU N/A, USR N/A, QTY 4, Catalog # 12841
3.	SQL ANYWHERE STUDIO FOR, Platform UNIX, CPY EO, CPU N/A, USR N/A, QTY 1, Catalog # 17892
4.	SYBASE IQ ENTERPRISE EDT, Platform Sun Solaris, CPY SW, CPU N/A, USR N/A, QTY 4, Catalog # 12841
5.	SYBASE IQ ENTERPRISE EDT, Platform Sun Solaris, CPY PW, CPU N/A, USR N/A, QTY 2, Catalog # 12841
6.	ECDA OPTION FOR ORACLE S, Platform Sun Solaris, CPY EO, CPU N/A, USR N/A, QTY 1, Catalog # 12943
7.	ENTERPRISECONNECT DATA, Platform Sun Solaris, CPY PW, CPU N/A, USR N/A, QTY 1, Catalog # 27403
8.	GOVERNMENT ENT SUP'T CONTACTS (6), QTY 1, Catalog # 98595
9.	SOLVED CASES INCLUDED CONTACTS (12), QTY 1, Catalog # 99994
10.	ANYWHERE INCLUDED GLOBAL CONTACTS 6, QTY 1,  Catalog # 99996

HOWEVER, any company or organization other than Sybase, Incorporated, which believes that it is capable of providing such software maintenance services to RITA / BTS at the high level of quality and efficiency that is indispensable to RITA / BTS, may e-mail, to Mr. James Mowery, a Statement of Qualifications, which must be received by Mr. Mowery at james.mowery@dot.gov  not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time June 30, 2009.  HOWEVER, any company or organization that is contemplating the submission of such a Statement of Qualifications should bear in mind that the company or organization would not ultimately be able to defeat Sybase in a competitive procurement for the needed software maintenance services without later proving (in a full-blown proposal) that the company or organization is the best buy for RITA / BTS, taking into consideration not only technical factors and quality factors but also pricing factors and past performance factors.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification using Recovery Act funding to contract number W91278-08-C-0013, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Allatoona Lake Project, Cartersville, Georgia, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815 Hennessey, OK. Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work:  1) Upgrade selected campsites to 50 amp electrical service at McKinney(131), Victoria(63), Sweetwater(54), 41 #3(23), Payne(26), Clark North(16), Clark South(40), McKaskey(32) and Stamp Creek(18) campgrounds and 2) Purchase and install new frost proof faucets in the same locations. This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>This existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared. The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each individual site. 2) The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in the Allatoona recreation area. 3) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance, and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation. 4) This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public assess to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.<BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address to below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolutions. HQ Army Materiel Command, Office of Command Counsel, 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527, Facsimile number (703)806-886 or 8875 - Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Materiel Command, Office of Command Counsel, Oom 2-1SE3401, 1412 Jackson Loop, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527. The AMC-level protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp - If Internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest Procedures.

All proposals in response to this solicitation will be evaluated using streamlined source selection procedures as outlined in the Army Source Selection Manual and the policies and procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15.3.  A best value Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection process will be used for this requirement.   <BR>3.

In order to receive a rating of acceptable your offer shall contain all of the information listed in established standards/factors under the technical proposal and in accordance with the PWS.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<BR>Factor 1:  Technical Capability/Management Approach <BR>Describe your technical capability and management approach to satisfying the requirement.  Your proposal shall include the following:<BR>a.  Organizational Structure and Communication:<BR> Outline your proposed organizational structure.

Describe your process for managing and controlling the team members, to include the subcontractors.  Discuss how reporting and review requirements will be imposed.

Affairs Legacy Knowledge:<BR>Describe your specialized experience and mastery of the principles, methods, practices and techniques of communication that will enable the offeror to function independently as a technical authority on public affairs topics.

As a minimum, the methodology should address knowledge, skills, security clearances, education, and experience requirements.  Explain the availability of the personnel proposed and your plan in the event that they are not available to immediately commence work on the start date of the contract. <BR>Factor 2:  Past Performance:<BR>The offerors past performance will be evaluated considering the offerors relevant experience and quality of service, and will be assigned a risk rating of low, moderate or high.  An offeror must receive no higher than a moderate risk rating for the Past Performance Factor to be acceptable for an award.<BR>      a.  The offerors past performance will be evaluated as a measure of the Governments confidence in the likelihood of the offeror to successfully perform based on previous and current contract efforts.  The evaluation of past performance is a subjective assessment of the offerors performance on contracts of similar nature, size, scope, and complexity, utilizing a comparable number of personnel with like skills.  The Government will consider the offerors previous and current record of contractual performance.  In this context, offeror refers to the proposed prime contractor and major subcontractors.  <BR>     b.  The past performance experience and record of previous performance under similar or related contracts will be evaluated as an indicator of the offerors ability to perform the contract.  This experience must be relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation and gained by the offeror and proposed team members during the last three (3) calendar years from the proposal due date.   <BR>     c.  The Government will assess the offerors recent and relevant performance in accordance with FAR 15.305 based on services they are expected to perform.  The Government will evaluate:  quality of services; timeliness of performance; meeting schedule records; key personnel management; ability to provide quality personnel and adequate non-labor resources for the life of the contract; business relations including the achievement of small business goals and compliance with limitation of subcontracting (when applicable); cost control; effectiveness of internal and external communications; ability to understand and resolve deficiencies in a timely manner with no adverse impact on the mission and the program; general responsiveness to contract requirements; and customer satisfaction.  A significant achievement, problem, and how the problem was resolved are considerations that will impact the overall risk rating of the past performance factor.  A negative finding under any element may result in an overall high risk rating.  <BR>     d.  Relevant experience should be discussed for all subcontractors proposing to support this solicitation.  Your relevant experience shall be within the last three years.  For those offerors without records of relevant experience, a rating of unknown will be assigned and the offerors will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  <BR>     e.  The offeror must have a broad affiliate group within advertising, public relations, media, web, print, graphic design, event planning, video and photography on a local, regional, national and international basis.  Global network should already be established with proven success.

This information shall be submitted for ALL contracts terminated, in whole or in part, for default or convenience during the past three (3) calendar years from the due date of the proposal.  Additionally, information should be provided for any contract currently in the process of such terminations.  This information is required for any contract, similar or not to the proposed effort.<BR>Offerors are reminded that both independent data and data provided by offerors in their proposals may be used by the Government to evaluate the offerors past performance.  Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offeror to explain the relevance of the data provided.  The Government does not assume the duty to search for data to cure problems it finds in the proposal.  The burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information remains with the offerors.  Proposals NOT containing the information requested risk the assignment of unknown risk or a past performance risk rating of high by the Government.  An award will not be made to an offeror who receives a high past performance risk rating. <BR> Past Performance Reference.  The Government may interview references submitted by the contractors to validate relevancy and the quality of the performance.    <BR> Offerors shall include in their proposal the written consent of the proposed subcontractors to allow the Government to contact their references and discuss the subcontractors' past performance evaluation with the offeror during any discussions.  The Government will verify/validate information on both prime and subcontractors that an offeror provides in its proposal.<BR>     j.  If the past performance information is adverse, the offeror may be given an opportunity to provide a rebuttal if not previously provided such an opportunity.  <BR>     k.  The past performance proposal will be assigned a risk rating of low, moderate, high, or unknown.  An offeror whose proposal demonstrates no past performance will be rated unknown. An award will not be made to any offeror who receives a high risk past performance rating.  The following risk assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of perceived risk and the probability of an offeror to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance.<BR>PAST PERFORMANCE RISK RATING:<BR>Low  Little doubt exits; Moderate  Some doubt exists; High  Significant doubt exists and Unkown  Little or no relevant past performance.<BR>Factor 3:   Price:   The price factor will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness of the price proposed for this requirement.  The evaluation will be performed on the total proposed estimated price, including the base performance period, and option periods.    Discuss the basis of estimate in terms of staffing proposed for each major section of the PWS (labor categories and number of hours) and rate determination methodology.   A rating will not be assigned to the Price Factor.  <BR>     a.  Completeness:  To be complete, the offeror shall provide all the data that is necessary to support the response.  The Government will assess the extent to which the price response complies with the content and format requirements set forth in this solicitation, and also exhibits traceability of estimates. <BR>    b.  Reasonableness:  The Government will evaluate proposed prices by performing the following assessments:  reviewing labor mix for compliance with Department of Labor Wage Determination (WD) and Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), if applicable; comparing total proposed prices with those of other offerors and the Independent Government Estimate (IGE); and comparing proposed labor mix and categories, with those submitted under Technical Response.   <BR>5.  Options:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluations of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <BR>Basis For Award<BR>1.  The Government will evaluate this requirement using a best value, lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) approach.  Tradeoffs are not permitted and no additional credit is given for exceeding acceptability.  Proposals are evaluated to determine whether they meet the acceptability levels for all evaluation factors.      <BR> 2.  The Government intends to evaluate responses and award a contract without communications with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial response should contain its best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to make clarifications or request revised responses if later determined by the Contacting Officer to be necessary.  <BR>3.  The government will evaluate the offerors technical proposal to determine whether it satisfies the requirements of the PWS and is executable as proposed.  A determination will be rendered as to whether the technical proposal is Acceptable or Unacceptable based on the definitions below. <BR>Definitions of Ratings used for LPTA:<BR>     a.  ACCEPTABLE.  Meets all specified minimum performance, capability, qualification, certification, education, and/or security requirements necessary for satisfactory order performance.  Approach is sound and executable and performance risk is low to moderate.   <BR>        b.  UNACCEPTABLE.

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for the service of sequencing food born pathogens.  The Statement of Work is as follows:


Background 
One of the FDA missions in the Division of Molecular Biology, Office of Applied Research and Safety Assessment, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, is to develop efficient and rapid identification of food born pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella species, Cronobacter species and other enteric bacterial food contaminants and to relate those food born samples to clinical samples, especially in the case of food borne outbreaks of disease. 
	For the last 20 years, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has been the standard used by the CDC and FDA through Pulse Net to characterize outbreak strains.  Both increased knowledge and changing technologies are changing the way outbreak strains need to be identified.  Specifically, the knowledge of entire genome sequences of over a hundred bacteria, variants in these sequences, and technologies of optical mapping, PCR, DNA microarrays (chips), mass spectroscopy, nucleotide signatures (snps), DNA sequencing and several other new technologies all promise potentially more rapid, less expensive, and better identification of food born pathogens.  
	As part of ongoing research on the cost, speed and usefulness of these different technologies we have been comparing sequencing, optical mapping, DNA microchip arrays, and other technologies.  Sequences of new Cronobacter species would provide critical information for ongoing outbreak analysis and would allow the evaluation of these other technologies for identifying Cronobacter isolates.

Objective 
The purpose of this contract is to ensure the timely delivery of genomic DNA sequences from ten Cronobacter species.  The quality, cost, and speed of  examining a strain of food born bacteria will be compared to other technologies of strain examination and identification.  

Project Scope 
This contract will provide ten genomic sequences to the Division of Molecular Biology FDA.  

Description of Work; Three phases
2.0.1 Sequencing.  An isolate of the strain of bacteria to be sequenced is grown and genomic DNA is prepared at the FDA.  DNA is sent to the contractor’s facility for sequencing.  Several upgrades have been implemented into 454 DNA sequencing, including paired end sequencing to improve sequencing efficiency, and other improvements in overall sequence read length and batch efficiency.  454 GS FLX Titanium Series combines 400-500 base shotgun and multi-span paired end reads (3 Kb, 8 Kb, 20 Kb) to produce for a 4-5 million base pair bacterial chromosome, 99-100% coverage in a ¼ plate run, with 15 x oversampling  in a run time of a week.  
Genomic DNA is sheared into 20 Kb, 8 Kb or 3 Kb fragments and adaptors are added to the end of each fragment.  A paired end library is constructed; DNA fragments containing added adaptors are isolated and amplified for sequencing.
Extra long 400-500 base pair shotgun reads can sequence through many genomic repeats.  

2.0.2 Contig assembly.  All the initial sequencing runs produce hundreds of sequences.  They must be assembled by computers and specially designed software.  From this assembly process for a bacterial genome 2-200 contigs are created for one genome.  

2.0.3 Annotation.  Using known sequences, software packages have been devised to compare the 2-200 contigs to known genes.  These programs are undergoing improvements in efficiency, speed and cost.  Their contribution to the overall cost of a genome sequence is decreasing with new programs.  

Task Deliverables and Milestones: 
Genomic sequences (electronic or on CD), four strains at one time.

Criteria for Acceptance
Deliverables will be submitted to the Principal Investigator who initiated the request.  We expect greater than 95% genome coverage of each strain, in approximately 2-300 contigs.   

Period of Performance 
July 7, 2009 through December 15, 2009 

Location, Work Schedule and Travel

<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are seeking small businesses [HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, small disadvantaged, 8(a), and woman-owned, minority-owned] ONLY, that can develop health communication materials for reducing ionizing radiation exposure to pediatric population from medical imaging. This a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items (as defined by FAR 2.101) prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. A written request for proposals will not be issued.  This acquisition is subject to FAR Subpart 13.5 regarding the application of simplified acquisition procedures. This acquisition is issued as Request for Proposal 09-223-SOL-00101. All responsible small business sources may submit an offer that will be considered. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990. The small business size standard is $7 million. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-32. Offers in response to this RFP shall be submitted by 12:00 pm Eastern Daylight Time, July 14, 2009. I. Background-Radiation Exposure from Medical Imaging-The National Council on Radiation Protection NCRP press release of March 2009 states that in 2006, Americans were exposed to more than six times as much ionizing radiation from medical procedures as was the case in the early 1980s. In 2006, medical exposure constituted nearly half of the total radiation exposure of the U.S. population from all sources. The increase was primarily a result of the growth in the use of medical imaging procedures. The increase was due mostly to the higher utilization of computed tomography (CT) and nuclear medicine. These two imaging modalities alone contributed 36 percent of the total radiation exposure and 75 percent of the medical radiation exposure of the U.S. population. The number of CT scans and nuclear medicine procedures performed in the United States during 2006 was estimated to be 67 million and 18 million, respectively. www.ncrponline.org. Pediatric population-Children are more sensitive to radiation received from medical imaging scans than adults. One factor to consider is that children have more rapidly dividing cells that can be exposed to the low-level radiation. Also, they have a longer expected lifetime for the effects of radiation exposure to manifest as cancer. That is why it is important that with children, the lowest radiation dose necessary is used for providing an image from which an accurate diagnosis can be made. FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) regulates medical imaging devices. Among its many responsibilities is helping consumers keep informed about minimizing unnecessary radiation exposure in medical procedures.
A health communication plan for addressing radiation from medical imaging for pediatric population can play a vital role in reducing public health risks from radiation. http://www.fda.gov/consumer/updates/radiology_kids062308.html. II. Scope of Work-
FDA/CDRH is requesting development of health communication materials for reducing ionizing radiation exposure to pediatric population from medical imaging. CDRH’s investment will increase awareness of the public health importance of reducing radiation exposure for pediatric population. Specific target audience(s) and justification for target audiences (may include consumers, health care providers, etc) for these materials will be developed by the contractor. The contractor will deliver to CDRH a health communication plan which will include recommendations for: 1) Key messages, 2) Channels of communication 3) Characteristics of the target audience(s), 4) Potential barriers to communication. The contractor will also develop health communication materials that incorporate information from the recommendations above. III. Period of Performance- Date of Award through six months. The Contractor shall begin no later than 7 days after award. IV.

<DESC><p>Background: The National Assessment Governing Board is an independent, bipartisan board that sets policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), commonly known as The Nation's Report Card.

<p>Created by Congress in 1988, the Governing Board is made up of 26 members, including governors, state legislators, local and state school officials, educators and researchers, business representatives, and members of the general public. More information on the Governing Board and its work is at www.nagb.org.</p>
<p>Requirements: The Governing Board is seeking a contractor to conduct a survey of higher education institutions to determine the tests and cut scores in reading and mathematics used to place entry level college students into credit bearing coursework and into remedial/developmental programs. The results of the survey will be used, along with results from other planned research, to enable NAEP to report on the preparedness of 12th graders for postsecondary education and training.</p>
<p>The scope of work required is described in Attachment A, the Statement of Work. Clarification questions are due to the Contracting Office address by June 26, 2009 at 12:00 P.M. Eastern Time.

3.1	Design the furniture systems for one (1) manager’s office and for six (6) work stations.
A furniture requirements statement/description is attached.  It contains the guidance regarding the furniture desired, a description of the general objectives to be achieved, as well as specific features required in both the manager’s office and work stations.

3.3	Deliver the furniture products to the OIG office at 12345 W. Alameda Parkway, Suite 350, Lakewood, CO.
Details regarding delivery to the 12345 W. Alameda Parkway building are provided in paragraph 4, Delivery.  Advance notice of delivery must be made with the local point of contact in order to coordinate with building management.  

3.5	Install the furniture products as required.

SECTION 6. 	SCHEDULE

The OIG acknowledges that this project is on a very compressed time schedule.  The following is the planned schedule to implement this project.

5:00 p.m. (EDT) 12 Jun 09	release RFQ
	5:00 p.m. (EDT) 22 Jun 09	proposals due to OIG
	5:00 p.m. (EDT) 24 Jun 09	award decision announced
	5:00 p.m. (EDT) 26 Jun 09	order placed 
	
SECTION 7.	GOVERNMENT POINTS OF CONTACT

The Government’s points of contact will be identified in the contract award documents.

SECTION 8.	EVALUATION FACTORS

8.1	The OIG’s source evaluation will be based on best-value principles. Accordingly, award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable offeror whose proposal provides the greatest overall value to the government, price and other factors considered. This best-value determination will be accomplished by comparing the value of the differences in the technical factors for competing offers, based on their strengths, weaknesses, with differences in their price to the Government. In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical capabilities than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. 

8.2	Evaluation of all offers will be made in accordance with the criteria outlined in this section. The proposals will be evaluated against the following three (3) factors:

Factor 1 Furniture Plan Design and Quality
Factor 2 Past Performance
Factor 3 Price

8.3	Factors 1 and 2 are the Technical Factors. Factor 3 is a Price Factor that will be evaluated separately and applied in the determination of best value. The rated technical evaluation criteria are more important than price. As relative technical advantages and disadvantages become less distinct, differences in price between proposals are of increased importance in determining the most advantageous proposal. Conversely, as differences in price become less distinct, differences in relative technical advantages and disadvantages between proposals are of increased importance to the determination.

8.4	 The technical evaluation will be attained through a determination and an analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each proposal. 

•	Furniture Plan Design and Quality.  Evaluation will be based on the degree to which the office and systems furniture plan supports the design objectives of the OIG, and meets the specific requirements stated for office and system furniture.  
•	Past Performance.  List of references demonstrating superior furniture design and installation support services.

SECTION 9.  Evaluation Criteria:  

Responses will be evaluated on a “best value” basis. Criteria are overall furniture design and quality, and price.

III. Evaluation Criteria:   
Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items (Jan 1999) 
The Factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Within each Factor, the Sub-factors are approximately equal in importance.  Offerors shall note that the evaluation Factors and Sub-factors are closely correlated to the proposal content.
Factor 1:   
Technical Expertise - The extent to which the Offeror’s proposal highlights their technical capabilities required to successfully complete the requirements in the PWS.  The offeror shall ensure that their proposal identifies how their capabilities map to the overall needs of the ITO and the PWS. The proposal shall identify the offeror’s current service offerings, as well as how they intend to ensure continued innovative and evolving high quality service offerings over time. 

a.	Demonstrated understanding of the work to be performed, and the ability to perform the work under the contract in a timely manner.
b.	Technical approach that adequately addresses all aspects of the work and inherent complexities, as well as compliance with the contract terms (quality control, security, etc.). 
c.	Performance Requirement Summary (PRS) - relationship of incentive structure to desired outcomes including incentive amounts. 
Factor 2:
Management Plan - The extent to which the Offeror’s proposal presents a management approach that is streamlined, efficient, and capable of proactively identifying, communicating, and resolving issues associated with this contract and task orders.  The Offeror’s proposal will be evaluated on how well it demonstrates that assigned Contractor personnel will have the ability to resolve issues in a timely manner and successfully complete the requirements on schedule, within budget and within acceptable quality levels.
a.	Qualifications/Staffing – the technical strength and industry expertise of the resources presented by an Offeror, and its ability to deliver quality staff over the life of the contract with the required certifications, provide qualifications/staffing capabilities to implement, operate, maintain and upgrade (as necessary) the services, and ability to turnaround staff quickly and efficiently. 

b.	Quality control – degree to which your approach meets or exceeds our quality control expectations as specified in the RFP, including the provision of a quality assurance approach and plan.

c.	Key Personnel and Resumes: Contractor’s key personnel and resources 	                 they will use to accomplish the contract requirements and tasks.

Factor 3: 
Corporate Capabilities - This factor will be evaluated based on your ability to provide the full range of services specified in the PWS. Corporate long-term viability and track record of conducting business in a legal and ethical manner will be considered. This will include evaluation of the:
a.	Background and Experience: qualifications, background, corporate experiences and knowledge in the task areas identified in the PWS which demonstrates the ability to successfully accomplish the work required by the contract.
b.	Corporate commitment to a successful ITO contract and program.

Factor 4:
Past Performance - The extent to which the Offeror’s past performance grades and scores reflect a history of effectively and efficiently meeting the requirements similar to those outlined in the RFP.  The past performance evaluation will consider the number and severity of problems, the effectiveness of any corrective actions taken, and the offeror's overall performance record. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
a.	Similarity of work performed in relation to the requirements of this contract and its complexity; 
b.	Quality of performance delivered; 
c.	Timeliness; and 
d.	Overall customer satisfaction.

Factor 5:

Price - The Government will evaluate price proposals, not only to determine whether the price is fair and reasonable, but also to determine an Offeror’s understanding of the PWS and ability to meet the objectives and scope. Price, while less important than the factors mentioned above, will become more critical as technical scores approach equality.  

Basis of Award

An award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal provides the best value to the Government. When combined, all evaluation factors other than price will be considered significantly more important than price.  If there are no significant technical differences among offerors and they are determined “technically equal”, price will be the determining factor for selection.  

 The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price of the base period and all options. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

We reserve the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if, in our judgment, the technical superiority of their offer outweighs any price difference.  We also reserve the right to award the contract to other than the offeror with the highest ranked technical proposal if, in our judgment, the potential price savings offset a difference in technical qualifications.  Additionally, we may:

(1)	Reject any and all offers;
(2)	Accept other than the lowest priced proposal; and 
(3)	Waive information and minor irregularities in offers received.

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jun 2008). 
The following FAR  provisions and clauses apply to this request for quotation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (Feb 1998) This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at these addresses: www.deskbook.Osd.mil or www.arnet.gov/far.  Contractors must have a valid Cage Code and DUNS number and be registered in CCR.

The closing date for receipt of quotes is June 22, 2009 at 11:00 am EST. Quotes may be submitted on company letterhead stationary and must include the following information:  Solicitation Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, Unit Price, Extended Price, Payment Terms and discount offered for prompt payment. Legal effect of quotations: As prescribed in FAR 13.004(a) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Therefore issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier’s quotation does not establish a contract.  The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions.  A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.  Facsimile quotes are acceptable and may be forwarded via fax number 252-335-6452.  Point of contact is Daniel House, Phone 252-384-7230, and email: Daniel.K.House@uscg.mil.

Quotes may be submitted on company letterhead stationary and must include the following information: Solicitation Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, Unit Price, Extended Price, Payment Terms and discount offered for prompt payment. 

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government in technical factors, and price considered.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. All questions/concerns regarding the Statement of Work shall be addressed via fax or email to the Point of Contracts (POC’s) listed in the solicitation.  Questions/concerns submitted via phone/voice mail will not be addressed.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors are listed in order of importance.  When combined, non-price factors are more important than price. 

1)	Technical Conformance to Specifications
2)	Past Performance
3)	Price

Technical Conformance 

The technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical assessment support capabilities for conformance with these requirements.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating obtaining any information not identified in the offer. An offer that does not provide sufficient information which describes their capacity to meet the RFQ’s technical evaluation can result in failure of this evaluation factor. 

Past Performance

Offers shall provide at least two (2) references for recent and relevant contracts for electrical support assessment.  Reference information must include contract numbers, points of contract names with telephone numbers and other relevant information.  For this factor the Government will evaluate information obtained from past performance information that the Government obtains about the offeror from these contacts or other sources.  Failure to address this requirement can result in failure of this evaluation factor.			

Price

Proposals should identify all prices inclusive of transportation/travel for site visits, assessment documents, reports, and CD’s.  Prices should reflect any prompt payment discounts if offered by the contractor to the government.

(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

INTRODUCTION

The Field Support Team (FST) within OPS coordinates surge capacity staffing mechanisms, manages an inter-agency agreement with the U.S. Forest Service for surge capacity staffing and OFDA response system design, maintains and trains on disaster response systems such as the DARTs and RMTs, and coordinates the Public Donations Information and Outreach project.  

The Disaster Resources Unit (DRU), within FST at the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), was created to assist with the transition of OFDA to rapid-response activities during a disaster.  In addition, the DRU manages OFDA’s dissemination of public donations information (more information on OFDA’s approach can be found at http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/humanitarian_assistance/disaster_assistance/help/index.html), OFDA’s role in the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination and International Search and Rescue systems, and staff security.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization’s programmatic goals and objectives.  

Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States government’s top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in Afghanistan, in line with US Government priorities.  The program will implement civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, primarily during the clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations that seek to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects.  In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.  

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this recruitment is to hire a qualified individual to support the OTI country team in the monitoring, evaluation, and information outreach of the OTI country program.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

NOTE: Applicants must review their experience/education against the required minimum qualifications for both the GS-12 and GS-13 positions carefully.  Applicants must submit a separate application for each position for which they wish to be considered.

Applicants must be cautious:  those who submit an application for the GS-13 grade level, but do not meet the minimum qualifications as reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEC) will not be considered for the GS-12 position if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-12 position. On the other hand, applicants who apply for only the GS-12 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-13 position will not be considered for the GS-13 position if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-13 position.

Qualified individuals are required to submit:

	NOTE: Submission of a resume in addition to the required forms is encouraged, 	but submission of a resume alone or in lieu of the OF-612 form IS NOT a 	complete application. All information to be evaluated must be contained in the 		OF-612 form and must not depend on references to your resume. Failure to 	provide the required information and/or materials will result in your not being 	considered for employment.

All applicants must submit complete dates (months/years) and hours per week for all positions listed on the OF-612 or on supplemental OF-612 continuation sheets to allow for adequate evaluation of your direct and related experience. Experience that cannot be quantified will not be counted towards meeting the solicitation requirements.

2.	A supplemental document specifically addressing: 
	Each of the Education/Experience requirements shown in the solicitation.
	Each of the five (5) Evaluation Factors shown in the solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>Note the amended proposal submission time. All quotes must be submitted NO LATER THAN 2:55 PM EST on June 12, 2009. Quotes submitted after 2:55 PM EST will not be considered.

The purpose of this amendment is to address questions posed.
Q: When do we get access to load in to the Lincoln Ballroom?  
A: Monday morning, September 21, 2009.
Q: Do you have a rehearsal/presenter review time planned? 
A: We would like to have the room set and ready for run-thru by 3pm on the 21st.
Q: Would you like us to provide presentation computers for the General Session/Awards? 
A:Yes, please provide these but price them separately.
Q:  Would you like us to provide PowerPoint technical support for any changes/revisions to presentations? 
A: No.
Q: Is there any recording of the breakout rooms required? 
A: No.
Q: There is no line item for labor in the template provided.  Is it acceptable to create line item 0008 to list the labor charges?
A: The contracting office can not advise you of how to prepare your proposal.
Q: In regards to theatrical lighting flown from truss: The only lighting detailed in the RFQ is for a Gobo.  This is normally a single lighting instrument dedicated to the Gobo.  Is there a lighting clause that was omitted? 
A: You are correct about the lighting requirements.  We will not be using theatrical lighting for this event but are asking about this qualification as a way of evaluating the experience level of the vendors. No lighting clauses were omitted.
Q: In regards to Video Playback on DVcam:  No DVcam is specified in the equipment list, only DVD is specified.  Was the DVcam omitted? 
A: The video playback will be from DVDs only.  DV Cam is not required.
Q: The RFQ specifies no scenic elements. Am I to understand that there will be elements provided by others? 
A: We are likely to use only plain staging with the exception of perhaps some black pipe and drape. Vendors may make recommendations for scenic elements but these should be priced separately.
Q: No teleprompting equipment is requested.  Will the IRS provide the equipment and need a technician to operate it? 
A: We will not be using a teleprompter.
Q: No uplink or downlink equipment is requested.  Should we be anticipating such a requirement. 
A: It is possible but unlikely.  If satellite becomes a new requirement we will make a contract modification.
Q: No webcasting is requested.  Should we anticipate this requirement?
A: No.
Q: What is the due date & time for proposal submissions?
***A: FRIDAY, JUNE 12, 2009 AT 2:55 PM EST. LATE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.***
Q: How should I submit my proposal?
A: Proposals can be submitted via email to Bridgette.Otero@irs.gov or via fax to (202) 283-1365. They can also be mailed to Bridgette Otero at 6009 Oxon Hill Road, Suite 900, Oxon Hill, MD 20745. Note that proposals must be RECEIVED no later than 2:55 PM EST on Friday, JUne 12, 2009. LATE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. Bridgette Otero will send an email confirming receipt with the date & time that your quote was received. ***The contract Specialist will be leaving the office promptly at 3:00 PM EST & will be unable to confirm receipt after 2:55 PM EST.***

Answer: The Focused Ion Beam manufacturer has indicated that they will not accept a coil-housing structure erected in close proximity to (or resting on) the column unit as it would interfere with their ability to service the equipment and the movement and/or disassembly is outside the scope of the existing equipment service agreement.    

Therefore, the system NIST requires must be able to be implemented via attachment of the Helmholtz coils to the walls and/or ceiling of the room.  For reference, the ceilings are approx. 13 feet high to the available Unistrut structures, and the FIB’s column footprint is   980 x 1192 mm.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Active Compensation System for Electromagnetic Stray Fields for a Zeiss NVision 40 Cross Beam Focused Ion Beam / Scanning Electron Microscope System. 

Background:

NIST’s Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology is in the process of moving a Zeiss NVision 40 CrossBeam Focused Ion Beam / Scanning Electron Microscope system to a new laboratory. 

Electro-magnetic interference tests confirmed the presence of a Quasi-static (DC) Magnetic Stray Field, caused by the elevator.  Survey results indicate that the present all axes stray field is 1.4 mGauss (P-P).  
Further lab renovations suggest that other active Electo-magnetic interference cancellation units will be deployed near the NVision40, but none are expected to be closer than 20 meters.

The use of a Helmholtz cage system is not acceptable, as it will cause interference with servicing and routine adjustments during normal Focused Ion Beam / Scanning Electron Microscope system operation.

All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following:

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is fourfold:

1.  The response date for this solicitation is hereby extended to 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday, June 24, 2009.

2.  The technical contact has offered an alternate title which may better describe the requirement:  “continuous emission monitoring system” or CEM.

3.  The technical contact has modified the background statement and specifications as follows:

Background statement:  A continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) system is sought to continually measure the concentration of six gases within the exhaust stream of micro cogeneration devices, which utilize the combustion of natural gas to create electrical and thermal energy concurrently.  The instrument will be installed within 1 meter of the exhaust vent in a mechanical room directly above the test facility for the micro cogeneration devices.  The mechanical room is a conditioned space with a steady temperature of approximately 25 °C.

Specifications:

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Continuous Emission Monitoring System/Exhaust Gas Analyzer, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:

1.	Exhaust gas analyzer should measure the concentration of the following gases over the range listed:
a.	CO2  (0 – 20%)
b.	CO  (0 – 5000 ppm)
c.	NOx  (0 – 1000 ppm)
d.	Hydrocarbons   (0 – 1000 ppm)
e.	SOx  (0 to 100 ppm)
f.	O2  (0-50%)
2.	Measurement accuracy of exhaust gas analyzer shall be better than 2 % at a sampling time of less than 30 seconds
3.	Analyzer shall include automated calibration system, if calibrations are required to maintain desired accuracy
4.	Analyzer shall condition sample, when necessary, to ensure accuracy
5.	Analyzer shall output concentration of above gases continually.  Digital output is preferred over individual analog output.
6.	Analyzer shall mount in a standard 19” instrumentation rack
7.	System shall include parts and labor warranty of at least 12 months

4.  Several questions have been posed by potential offerors.  Below are the questions and the answers from the technical contact:

Question:  What are the LODs (limits of detection) required for each gas species?
Answer:  CO2  -  0.1%;  CO  -  0.5 ppm;  NOx – 1 ppm;  SOx – 10 ppb;  Hydrocarbons – 100 ppb;  Oxygen – 0.1 %

Question:  Can the concentrations of NO and NO2 be generated and listed separately rather than a single combined value as NOx?
Answer:  Yes, the constituents listed are the minimum allowable specification

Question:  Similarly for the Hydrocarbons, can the individual CxHy species be measured separately, or only as "total hydrocarbons as CH4"?
Answer:  Yes

Qeustion:  What will be the temperature and pressure ranges of the sampled gases in the exhaust gas stream? And what will be the flowrate of the exhaust gas stream?
Answer:  The facility will be used to test many different micro-cogeneration systems, and the temperature, pressure, and flow rate will vary between systems.  Typically, the temperature of the exhaust is between 50 °C and 90 °C.  The exhaust is normally not pressurized, and it can be assumed to be at atmospheric pressure.  The flow rate could vary between 20 CFM and 100 CFM.

Question:  Please explain what is at the other end of the 8-meter sample pipe run, and what space of equipment is located within that 8-meter distance.
Answer:  We have just received permission to locate the analyzer in the mechanical space above the laboratory, which allows the analyzer to be installed less than 1 meter from the exhaust stack.  The mechanical space is maintained at a temperature of approximately 22 - 25 °C.

Question:  Will the large environmental chamber be kept at a constant temperature during operation and measurement or will it vary during the course of operation of the cogeneration device?
Answer:  The analyzer will be installed in a mechanical space (see answer above) that maintains a constant temperature

Question:  What are the environmental conditions OUTSIDE the chamber where the actual equipment would be located if it cannot operate in the range of temperatures given inside the chamber? Is it a relatively stable environment? Ideally it would stay between 40-80*F..
Answer:  We have just received permission to locate the analyzer in the mechanical space above the laboratory, which allows the analyzer to be installed less than 1 meter from the exhaust stack.  The mechanical space is maintained at a temperature of approximately 22 - 25 °C.

Question:  Instrument technology-do you have any other requirement besides the 2% accuracy?  Normally a spec like this will reference an EPA performance specification or applicable regulation..
Answer:  The intended application of the exhaust gas analyzer is not a regulated activity, and it does not fall under the purview of the EPA performance specifications, necessarily.

All other terms and conditions of the original solicitation are unchanged and remain in full effect.

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY REPLACES THE ORIGINAL SUMMARY THAT WAS FIRST POSTED 5/27/2009 AND THE SECOND SUMMARY THAT WAS POSTED 6/3/2009.  THE RESPONSE DEADLINE IS EXTENDED TO 6/26/2009.

SUMMARY REQUIREMENT:
The General Services Administration (GSA) desires to lease between 11,613 rentable square feet (RSF) and 12,774 RSF of office and related space, yielding between 10,098 ANSI/BOMA Office area (formerly usable) square feet (USF) and 11,107 USF of either build-to-suit or existing modern office space.  The space will be occupied by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to house personnel, furnishings, and equipment.  A minimum of 62 outside/surface parking spaces are required (31 employee; 31 visitor), with employee parking separate from visitor parking.

BUILDING REQUIREMENT:
The facility must be professional in appearance, well maintained, of modern design, and of sound and substantial construction.  The space shall be located in a professional office setting and not within close proximity to residential areas, railroad tracks, busy intersections or one-way access roads.  Sites which are located directly on a highway or six-lane thoroughfare will not be considered in the following instances:  (1) if the two directions of traffic are separated by a physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within one block; or (2) if access to the location is directly from a highway, unless there is a traffic control device within two blocks (or an equivalent distance) from the proposed office space.  Locations must be as convenient to the visiting public as possible.  Space shall not be located within a base floodplain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.  For new construction and existing space, a setback of 20 feet is required.

The requested space must be fully serviced, and in a building capable of being altered to meet the Government’s needs and security requirements as well as the Government’s requirements for fire and life safety and handicap accessibility.

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:
Space shall be on the second floor (if in the flood plain), shall be contiguous, and on one level without being split by a public corridor or firewalls.  Space must have the potential for efficient layout; columns must be at least 28 feet apart center-to-center, and 28 feet from any interior wall and be no more than two feet square; space should not be “U” or “L” shaped or exceed a length to width ratio of 2:3.  The following space configurations will not be considered:  space with atriums or other areas interrupting contiguous space, extremely long or narrow runs of space, irregularly shaped space configurations, or other unusual building features adversely affecting usage.  Elevator service must consist of a minimum of two industrial, handicap accessible elevators (only one may serve as a freight elevator).

Public transportation, if available, must be within two blocks of the space.  In suburban areas, in small communities and in areas of major cities where adequate public transportation and on site parking are not available, secure vehicle parking facilities MUST be available at reasonable commercial rates for visitors and employees within a two block radius of the space.  Secure parking is defined as parking that meets Federal Protective Service guidelines and should be resolved before any lease is signed.  “Reasonable rates” will be determined by local pricing levels.

In those locations where on site parking is not available, parking for the disabled must be located within the same block.  In addition, GSA will contact local authorities and request the placement of a loading/unloading zone in front of the office for the disabled and other visitors.  A request to GSA will also be made on behalf of disabled employees in those locations where on site parking is not available.

Availability of public transportation, public and commercial parking, and on site parking shall be considered as award factors in evaluating offers, but not as requirements of the Solicitation for Offers (S.F.O).  Locations which meet SSA space requirements and have on site parking for visitors and employees shall be given priority consideration during the process of evaluating offers from potential lessors.

Restricted or metered parking of one hour or less within the two block area of the space does not meet parking requirements.  This is because many SSA contacts with the public cannot be completed within one hour.

Failure to meet the above parking requirements constitutes grounds for rejecting a site.

LOCATION / DELINEATED AREA:
The building offered must be located in Galveston County, TX, within the following boundaries:

North:  FM646
East:  One mile east of I-45
South:  Galveston Island (including the entire island)
West:  One mile west of I-45

LEASE TERM:
The term is for fifteen (15) years, ten (10) years firm.

Expressions of interest should include the following:
Building name and address or, for unimproved sites, provide specific location.
One-eighth scale drawing of space offered or, for unimproved sites, provide site plan and location map.
Confirm BOMA method of measurement, usable yield for available space by floor, and building common area factor.
Name, address, and telephone number of individual to be contacted.

Owners and Authorized Agents:
Brokers and agents may represent prospective landlords, but any properties or proposals submitted by the brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building’s ownership.

Authorized contacts:
In no event shall the offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning the space to be leased with representatives of any Federal Agency other than the officers and employees of the GSA.

Responses to this ad should be received by June 26, 2009 referencing project No. 9TX2150.

<CONTACT>Dan Marcantonio, (586) 574-9062

<a href="mailto:daniel.marcantonio@us.army.mil">TACOM - Warren Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>Introduction:<BR>The Family of Light Armored Vehicles (FOLAV) has been in the USMC inventory since 1983.  Since the initial fielding of the FOLAV there have been two major upgrades; the Service Life Extension Program LAV-A1 (SLEP) (1998-2002) and the LAV-A2 Survivability Upgrade (LAV A2 SU) (2006-2010).  While these upgrades extended the primary systems service life of the FOLAV through 2025, the upgrades did not address the variant specific subsystem mission suites on the LAV-ATA2.  Basic characteristics of the LAV platform are provided in Attachment 1 of this RFI.<BR><BR>The LAV-ATA2s subsystem mission suite has become difficult to support and several subcomponents are obsolete.  In fact, the M901A1 TOW has reached the point of ever increasing obsolescence limiting it to USMC inventory.  As part of additional service life extension and fleet upgrade efforts, PM-LAV is evaluating improvements to the turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system. The specific purpose of this program is to improve the supportability and mission effectiveness of the LAV-ATA2 by providing the following mission suite upgrades:<BR>1.	An Anti-Tank weapon station with:<BR><BR>"	Multiple reload, and rapid capability<BR>"	Ability to facilitate multiple target engagements in high intensive fights<BR>"	An effective platform for Elevated TOW Systems (ETS), and offers the LAR Battalion a precision long-range capability to destroy the enemy<BR>"	A second generation thermal sight and an advanced fire control system capable of firing the current and next generation heavy anti-armor missiles<BR>"	Improved reliability, availability, and maintainability<BR><BR>2.	Turret Trainers for the Operational Forces and float assets for each of the<BR>Maintenance Centers<BR><BR><BR>The following are specific objectives of this program:<BR><BR>"	Provide the LAV-AT mission suite upgrades initial operational capability by May 13, 2013 and full operational capability by August 3rd 2016<BR>"	Improve LAV-AT  readiness by greater than 10% and reduce the operational and support cost by greater than 5%<BR><BR>The deliverables/resultant products of this effort will be 115 LAV-AT modernized with the mission suite upgrades, nine LAV-AT Turret Trainers, two turrets float assets with all mission suite upgrades applied.  In addition meet all milestones and provide supporting documentation required per SECNAV Instruction 5000.2D (unless otherwise directed by MARCORPSYSCOM ACPROG authority).<BR><BR>It is anticipated that after receipt of information from the respondents of this RFI, the government will conduct a trade study followed by a downselect process to determine several leading turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system solution candidates that will undergo additional evaluation.  The evaluation will include ergonomic assessments, spaceclaim and mounting studies, human factors studies, modeling and simulation. Turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system samples may also be acquired for physical measurement, performance evaluations, and testing.  The proposed solutions will be evaluated against current and future mission profiles and the impact of the design on life cycle cost of the LAV system.  <BR>Specific areas of evaluation for the turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system trade study and downselect include these requirements (T = threshold / O = Objective):<BR>"	effectively acquire, engage, and destroy threat main battle tanks beyond the range of enemy tank main guns (T)								<BR>"	ability to destroy bunkers and concrete buildings that harbor threat (T)<BR>"	allow for search and target acquisition while stationary (T)			<BR>"	allow for search and target acquisition on the move (O)<BR>"	allow rapid transition from battlefield movement to target engagement (T)<BR>"	acquire targets, fire, and reload while under armor protection (T)<BR>"	acquire targets, fire, and reload from inside the vehicle (O)<BR>"	fire from a short halt (T)<BR>"	fire on the move (O)<BR>"	acquire, engage, and destroy the enemy with its main armament in a 3600 field of fire (T)<BR>"	acquire, engage, and destroy the enemy with its main armament, day or night, under obscured conditions of smoke, fog, haze and dust (T)<BR>"	store and fire a minimum of 2 ready rounds in launcher and minimum of 14 stored rounds  (T)<BR>"	store and fire a minimum of 4 ready rounds (O)<BR>"	capable of fire multiple missiles without reloading (T)<BR>"	have an automatic loader or have the capability of being retro-fit with an automatic loader (O)<BR>"	accommodate ground mounting when necessary (T)<BR>"	fire current and next generation USMC inventory heavy anti-armor missiles (T)<BR>"	provide fire and forget anti-tank weapon system capability (O)<BR>"	training commonality for current and next generation heavy anti-armor missiles (O)<BR>"	LAV-AT crew consists of four Marines (T)<BR>"	Full mission capability with three personnel (O)<BR>"	achieve a Probability of Hit of .75 at the maximum effective range of the weapon (T)<BR>"	achieve a Probability of Hit of .9 at the maximum effective range of the weapon (O)<BR>"	achieve compatibility with the LAV-AT secondary armament (M240E1, 7.62 mm machine gun pintle, with azimuth and elevation travel locks with a minimum 1800 arc traverse and accessible through the commanders hatch) (T)<BR>"	have degraded capability to permit targets to be acquired and destroyed when the main power and /or hydraulic system of the LAV-AT have failed (O)<BR>Responses should include descriptions of sustainment characteristics such as reliability Mean Miles Between Failures (MMBF), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), commonality with other systems, and in theater sustainment.  Additional technical data will likely be requested from participating turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system manufacturers, including spaceclaim and interface drawings, prior test data, mass properties, and dynamic stiffness characteristics.  This information will be applied to the validated modeling and simulation environment.  Results of the evaluation will be shared with each potential supplier as may be appropriate. <BR><BR>If you are interested in participating in this LAV upgrade effort, please respond by completing the Attachment 2 questionnaire and send it to:<BR>Dan Marcantonio<BR>Procurement Analyst<BR>daniel.marcontonio@us.army.mil <BR>586-574-9062<BR><BR>Please feel free to include any additional product brochures, test results, technical data, etc. that you believe is relevant to the LAV application.<BR><BR>Thank you in advance for your help on our trade study for the LAV turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system and we look forward to continued discussion on this project. <BR><BR>      <BR> The LAV is a family of 8x8 wheeled, diesel-powered, lightly-armored vehicles combining speed, mobility and firepower to fulfill a variety of missions for the U.S. Marine Corps.  The versatile LAV brings Marines to the fight on land and in water while also providing a weapons platform for anti-tank missiles and mortars, functioning as a command and control vehicle, or performing logistical and recovery tasks.  LAVs are equipped with twin aft propellers and rudders and can attain 6.5 mph in calm waters of rivers or for fording streams.  <BR>The LAV-AT provides ballistic protection equivalent to the base chassis.  The vehicle provides the vehicle commander and gunner with full 360 visibility in the closed hatch mode via periscopes.  The primary weapon is a hydraulically powered M901 Anti-Tank TOW missile weapon station and target acquisition system.  The LAV-AT has a crew of four.<BR>The LAV entered the Marine Corps in 1983 with a service life expectation of 2005.  As of 2007, the Marine Corps Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) has been in service for more than 24 years and is now projected to remain in service until at least 2025.  Through programs of service life extension, upgrades to armor and armament, along with survivability and capability enhancements the LAV remains fully ready for the battlefields of the 21st century.<BR>LAV Specifications and Performance<BR>Length	20.96 ft (6.39 m)	<BR>Width	8.20 ft (2.50 m)	<BR>Height	8.83 ft (2.69 m)	<BR>Weight	14.1 tons (12.8 m-tons)	<BR>Engine	Detroit Diesel 6V53T 275 Hp diesel	<BR>Transmission	Allison MT653 5 fwd, 1 rev	<BR>Drive	(8x8) Rear two axles full time, front two axles selectable	<BR>Differentials	Four for wheeled axles, two for water propellers	<BR>Armament (LAV-AT)	M901A1 Anti-Tank TOW missile weapon station<BR>A M240 7.62mm medium machine gun<BR>Two 4-barrel grenade launchers	<BR>	Ammunition (LAV-AT)	2 ready rounds and 14 stored rounds of TOW missiles<BR>200 ready rounds, 800 stowed rounds of 7.62mm <BR>8 ready rounds and 8 stowed rounds of smoke grenades<BR>	Max speed (highway)	60 mph<BR>	Max grade	60%<BR>	Max side slope	30%<BR>	Acceleration	0-20mph, less than 10 sec.<BR>	Vertical step capability	18 inches<BR>	Cruising range	400 miles<BR>	Ground clearance	14 inches<BR>	Air transportable	C130 Hercules, CH53E Sea Stallion<BR><BR>LAV Configurations<BR>There are more than 700 LAVs in the Marine Corps 2007 inventory, fielded in one of seven different model variants or configurations:<BR>LAV-25, base model, armed with an M242 25mm chain gun<BR>LAV-AT, Antitank, equipped with TOW missile system<BR>LAV-C2, Command and Control (C2)<BR>LAV-L, Logistics vehicle, providing cargo and maintenance capacity<BR>LAV-M, Mortar 81mm Mortar carrier<BR>LAV-R, Recovery vehicle<BR>LAV-MEWSS, Mobile Electronic Warfare Support System <BR>1.

The life of the basic contract is for a base period of three (3) years with two (2) one-year option periods or $200M; whichever occurs first. The pool size (number of contracts that may be awarded) shall not exceed six (6) contractors. The pool of contractors which successfully receive an award will share the total contract capacity of $200M. The government will use a two-phase design build evaluation process. The order limitation of task orders, to include the seed task order that will be used for evaluation purposes and award of the initial contracts, shall range between $1M and $20M. Task orders issued under this MATOC will be firm-fixed price. The initial seed task order may include options.</p>

Work under this MATOC may also include the design and the construction of various types of facilities including but not limited to, administrative, recreational, educational, religious, medical, and training type as well as their corresponding support facilities. Generally, however, task orders anticipated to be issued under this MATOC will be primarily for new, vertical construction and associated site work. <br /><br />Evaluation Criteria: As this is a solicitation for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), a seed task order will be provided to those Offerors invited to participate in Phase II for purposes of evaluation and in rendering the best value decision.

All other successful Offerors, if any, will be awarded a contract with a minimum guarantee of $2,500. The evaluation factors and their relative importance for both Phase I and Phase II of this solicitation and evaluation process are as follows: <br /><br />Phase I: Factor 1-1 CORPORATE RELEVANT SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE, Factor 1-2 PAST PERFORMANCE, and Factor 1-3 TECHNICAL APPROACH NARRATIVE. Factor 1-1 is more important than factors 1-2 and 1-3. Factor 1-2: is equal in importance to Factor 1-3.

FACTOR 2-5: Slightly less important than Factor 2-4. FACTOR 2-6: least important.<br /><br />Price: All non-cost factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.<br /><br />Award will be made to those Offerors whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of the criteria requested that offers the best value to the Government. Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow complete evaluation. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the Offeror.<br /><br />This solicitation will be issued in electronic format only.

<SUBJECT>69--C15 ENGINE/TRANSMISSION (ET) TRAINER
<SOLNBR>M6785409R8104
<CONTACT>Graham K. Oliff Jr. 407-380-8152
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide industry submitted questions and Government answers.
Q1. We understand that the C15 ET Trainer will be mounted on a mobile stand.  Can you provide clarification concerning the fidelity of the trainer driver's position?  For example, does the vehicle instrument panel, accelerator, etc. have to be mounted in a mockup of the LVSR driver's position to the correct height, etc.?  Does the stand have to contain a mockup of the LVSR engine compartment, etc?
A1. The drivers position, correct height, etc does not have to replicate the exact LVSR dash position, height, etc.  However, the configuration of the instruments on the "dash" need to replicate the LVSR dash (as stated in the SPEC 3.3.6).  IE:  the layout of the instruments on the actual LVSR dash shall be replicated on the LVSR engine trainer "dash / control panel". 
Q2. The GFP list indicates that there will be 12 engines and transmissions provided.  Is the suite of 12 engines/transmissions considered one trainer - or - each engine/transmission considered a trainer?
A2. Each engine/transmission will be used to create an individual trainer (ie: 12 engine/transmissions = 12 trainers)
Q3. See Paragraph 3.3.10.1 of the Performance Spec.  This paragraph indicates that there are twelve faults to be inserted.  Are all twelve faults to be inserted into each engine/transmission -or- are the faults to be distributed throughout the 12 engines/transmissions provided?  In other words, each engine/transmission would have its own unique fault.
A3. There will be 12 injectable faults on each trainer.
Q4. See Paragraph  3.10.1 of the Performance Spec.  This paragraph indicates the trainer shall support training a maximum of 4 students concurrently per C15 ET trainer.  Does this mean a max of 4 students each engine/transmission or max 4 students for all 12 engine/transmissions?
A4. 4 students per trainer (ie: 48 students for 12 trainers)

Box 7954 Cartagena de Indias D.T. y C., Colombia Tel (57-5) 660-7781 Fax (57-5) 660-9004 Ports of Cartagena and Contecar Central Security and Customs Facility Feasibility Study. The Grantee (Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Cartagena) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to develop a central customs and security facility that will serve the two ports. The objective of this feasibility study in Colombia is to develop a central customs and security facility that will serve the Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Cartagena&rsquo;s (SPRC) Ports of Cartagena and Contecar, which are located 15 kilometers apart. Over the past 13 years, SPRC&rsquo;s container traffic has multiplied seven-fold, and its facilities can handle over 1,000,000 TEUs and 600,000 tons of bulk cargo per year. SPRC succeeded in obtaining a U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) designation for the Port of Cartagena. The Feasibility Study would support the development of a central customs and security system to serve these two ports operated by SPRC, and possibly other terminals in the area. The project will supplement and expand container handling capacity at Cartagena and improve SPRC&rsquo;s competitive position. SPRC intends to extend Cartagena&rsquo;s Terminal Operating System to the Port of Contecar by connecting the terminal security of the two operations with technology such as fiber optic cabling and wireless transmitters. The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Feasibility Study include the following tasks: (1) review existing security and customs clearance systems, (2) identify and evaluate potential sites for the central security and customs facility, (3) interim presentation, (4) development and environmental impacts, (5) performance specifications and implementation plan, and (6) final report and presentation. The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm&rsquo;s name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA. Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP. Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 6:00PM local time, Tuesday, June 23, 2009 at the address above. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<AWARDEE>West Valley Environmental Services, 10282 Rock Springs Road, West Valley, NY 14171 US
<DESC><p>Clean up of the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP) was mandated by Congress through the West Valley Demonstration Project Act of 1982. A competitive contract was awarded in June 2007 to continue clean up efforts begun under previous contracts. After award, changes in overall priorities projected funding levels and compliance with new and or changed regulatory requirements resulted in the expansion of work scope, and the rescheduling of work required to be completed under the contract.
<p>This award modifies the current contract statement of work to allow work efforts that were displaced or delayed by the rescheduling of work, and allows some of the work to be completed to the original contract schedule, provides for completion of certain scopes of work ahead of the original contract schedule and adds work scope that will further the clean up of the WVDP sooner than anticipated.</p>
<p>The scopes of work covered by the modification are:<br /><br />Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&amp;D) of the Main Plant Process Building including removal of all vessels and process piping within the building by June 30, 2011. This effort was delayed and this award places it back on schedule.</p>
<p>Characterize, process and package for disposal Transuranic Waste and Mixed Transuranic Waste in accordance with new requirements issued after contract award.</p>
<p>Evaluate potential storage systems for canisters containing High Level Waste, determine which storage system best meets DOE requirements, and with DOE approval obtain a conceptual design for the system. The High Level Waste canisters are currently stored in the Main Plant Process Building but will need to be moved to a safe secure location before the planned future demolition of the building can take place.</p>
<p>Obtain, install and use a system to solidify contaminated liquid wastes that are generated during the Decontamination and Decommissioning of the Main Plant Process Building. Solidifying contaminated liquid waste eliminates the risk that a contaminated liquid will leak or leach out of its container. Handling solid waste is safer, and easier than handling and storing liquid waste as originally planned in the contract.</p>
<p>Isolate the Waste Tank Farm and installation of a drying system within the Tank and Vault system. The metal High Level Liquid waste tanks are located in an underground facility a drying system is required to prevent dampness and corrosion of the tanks.</p>
<p>Install a barrier system to filter and remove Strontium 90 from the North Plateau water plume. This method will be more economical and effective than the current method of treatment.<br /><br />Decontaminate, Demolish and remove the O1-14 Building, providing for demolition and removal of the building at the same time as decontamination is more cost effective overall than doing the work in separate efforts.</p>
<p>Isolate Lagoons 2, 3, 4, and 5. The lagoons held water generated on site for various purposes until the water was determined to be safe to discharge off site. The lagoons are no longer needed and shutting down the pipes that carry water into the lagoons will prevent any more water being added.</p>
<p>Decontaminate, Decommission and Demolish the Vitrification Facility by <br />September 30, 2010, this speeds up completion from the original contract required completion of this work by June 30, 2011</p>
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:</p>
<p>The complexity and uncertainty of the work required under the contract doesn't lend itself to fixed price. Some of the work to be accomplished under this modification was already awarded to the contractor under a competitive contract. There would be significant contract issues involved in taking this work away and making the contractor re-compete for work already under the contract. The WVDP is situated on approximately 240 acres however the majority of the facilities are concentrated on a parcel approximately &frac14; of a square mile in size. The current WVDP staff is very limited and does not have enough personnel to provide oversight of multiple contractors, and having multiple contractors working in the same limited area increases safety and performance risks. The contractor will be encouraged wherever possible to award subcontracts on a fixed price basis.</p>

<DESC><p>The scope of the ARRA-funded activity is to increase the number of railcars which will result in remediation of an additional 2 million tons of uranium mill tailings by September 30, 2011 at the Moab Project site.
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:</p>
<p>The work being performed under the existing task order (base work) is within the scope of CLIN 001, Environmental Remediation/Waste Management, of the master ID/IQ contract (DE-AM09-05SR22406). The nature of the ARRA-funded activity is of the same scope and complexity as the base work.</p>
<p>Clause H.10, "Ordering Procedures" of the master contract placed offerors on notice that additional work may be added in the form of a follow-on to an order already issued under the contract. Clause H.10 subparagraph (b) grants the Designated Contracting Officer (DCO) the authority to issue a task order to any of the ID/IQ awardees providing the task awarded is a logical follow-on to an existing order. The specific language of Clause H.10, "Ordering Procedures", subparagraph b (3) reads as follows:</p>
<p>"This task is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this clause..."</p>

<DESC><p>The IDIQ Task Order No. DE-AT30-07CC60011/SL14 is a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) Small Business Set-Aside awarded to C/P/E Environmental Services, LLC. The Task Order is receiving ARRA funding in the amount of $7.9 million dollars to enable the acceleration of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) Environmental Remediation Project to accelerate existing scope under the task order for a project completion date in the year 2011 versus 2012. The current scope to be accelerated includes soil and groundwater investigations, feasibility studies, remedial action plans, remedial design, soil removal actions and treatment system construction, start-up, and testing.
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:</p>
<p>Clause H.10, subparagraph (b) of the master contract grants the Contracting Officer the authority to issue a task order to any of the IDIQ awardees providing the task awarded is a logical follow-on to an existing order. The original offerors were given a fair opportunity to be considered when the original task order was competed. The changed project is substantially the same as the project contemplated by the parties. The new funding merely accelerates the schedule for the current SLAC Environmental Remediation Project site remediation activities including those activities currently in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>The work is characterized as an environmental remediation project. The nature of the work requires some flexibility to accomplish. Therefore, it would not be feasible to award a fixed price award for this effort.</p>
