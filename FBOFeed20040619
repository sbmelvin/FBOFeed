<DESC>We recently became aware of a term we used in the coversheet for Solicitation #RFQ V15-04-0060 dated February 19, 2004. Specifically, in box #20 we state "Multitone paging system as described below". This is the only time the term "Multitone" was used in the solicitation. For our purposes, we defined this term as meaning: "Referring to a pager's ability to receive multiple tones based on a preprogrammed parameter in the paging system, usually involving something like a Code Pager, and the paging transmitter's capability to generate that signal. When normally called, it generates one tone, when Code paged, it generates another tone. This is a programming option in the paging terminal, a physical option in the pager, and a transmission capability of the paging transmitter." It has come to our attention that this term is ambiguous, and could imply that we were specifying one particular vendor's equipment with its use. This was and is not our intent. The specific requirements of this solicitation are delineated in the "Description of Supplies/Statement of Work" section of the document. Any equipment, regardless of manufacturer, which meet these requirements, will be considered a viable solution. Due to the ambiguity, the prior decisions which established a competitive range is hereby rescinded. Receipt of revised quotes is extended. For evaluation purposes please send five (5) copies of your bid to this office. Close date changes to June 28, 2004, 4:30 PM CST. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

Baghdad City Streets
Baghdad City Streets, with Iraq's major roads and highways  
Maptech and LeadDog Consulting have partnered to offer a software package that includes detailed street maps of Baghdad and the Iraqi road network. 
Here is a new dimension to knowing where you are in Iraq. "Baghdad City Streets" offers soldiers, military personnel, journalists, and workers stationed in Baghdad or other Iraqi cities a better means of navigation. 
 

It also helps military families who have family members based in Iraq, allowing them to see a map of where their loved ones are.

In addition to the latest, most detailed street maps for Baghdad, the CD includes the major roads and highways for the entire country including the seventeen major cities. 
These maps are GPS compatible, so you can use them on a laptop  with a GPS attached, for laptop navigation. Or you can get Pocket Navigator software and download your maps to your Pocket PC - then add a GPS for handheld navigation. 
We recommend Pharos GPS receivers to provide you the most versatility for GPS choices.  There are options for use with a laptop, or on a PDA with a CF GPS, SD GPS, or wired GPS to your HP IPAQ or other Pocket PC.
