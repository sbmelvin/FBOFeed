When infusing 0.20 pmol/&micro;L reserpine solution at a flow rate 10 &micro;L/min and scanning at 4000 amu/sec with Q0 trapping deactivated, the intensity of the fragment ion at m/z 397 resulting from fragmentation of the parent ion at m/z 609 preferably is greater than 3.0 x 106 cps for 20 scans MCA.<br /><br />3.7.1. When infusing 0.20 picomole/&micro;L of reserpine at 10&micro;L/min, the intensity of the secondary fragment ion m/z 236 (a fragment of the primary fragment ion m/z 397) for a single 1000 amu/sec MS/MS/MS scan preferably will exceed 10% of the intensity of its precursor ion (m/z 397) from the Enhanced Product Ion Scan.<br /><br />3.9.2. The instrument preferably should possess data compatibility to maintain the continuity of pre-existing data, cross verification and data transferability from an existing AB SCIEX hybrid linear ion trap-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for the analysis of ciguatoxins in fish.
