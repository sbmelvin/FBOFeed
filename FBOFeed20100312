<DESC><p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation to procure a Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) and/or modified COTS automated editing software that auto-denies Medicare health care claims across all claims types such as claims issued by hospitals, physicians, skilled nursing facilities, labs, ambulance companies, and durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers. CMS is only interested in engaging new application(s) that will be used by CMS and/or its contractors for denying improper claims before they are paid by the Medicare program (i.e., could be installed on a "prepayment" basis). CMS is NOT interested in software that identifies claims for human review, software that requires a comparison to a medical record or software that could only operate on a "postpayment" basis.<br /><br />This pre-solicitation notice is hereby posted in accordance with FAR 5.2. CMS reserves the right and anticipates making multiple IDIQ contract awards. The Government anticipates issuing task order 0001 to each IDIQ contract awardee for the performance of a field test. The results of the field test will be submitted to the Governement and used as an evaluation factor for the award of task order number 0002. The Government anticipates issuing a competitive RFP to all IDIQ contract holders for task order 0002 and anticipates awarding only one task order.<br /><br />The solicitation will be issued in accordance with FAR Part 15. CMS plans to issue the solicitation as a full and open competition.<br /><br />CMS anticipates making multiple IDIQ awards. CMS intends to use a multi-step acquisition process for this procurement to test automated edit products for completeness and accuracy through two required tests. The first test is considered small scale and requires vendors to submit answers to CMS to be assessed. The top qualified Vendors under the small scale test that provide the best overall solution will be awarded an IDIQ Contract and issued Task Order 0001 to perform a larger field test.</p>
<p>Under Task Order 0001, vendors will compete on the accuracy of their product(s) and technical capability to process millions of claims per day. CMS anticipates only making one award of the Automated Edit Module work under Task Order 0002. The IDIQ SOW includes all work awarded under this solicitation and anticipated future work such as implementation of Predictive Modeling for claims in a pre-pay mode.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> <br />Medicare is a multifaceted program. The Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) program consists of a number of payment systems, with a network of contractors that process over 1.2 billion claims each year, submitted by more than 1 million health care providers such as hospitals, physicians, skilled nursing facilities, labs, ambulance companies, and durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers. These contractors, called "Medicare Administrative contractors (MAC)," process claims, make payments to health care providers in accordance with Medicare regulations, and are responsible for educating providers about how to submit accurately coded claims that meet Medicare's medical necessity guidelines.<br /><br />Despite actions to prevent or recoup improper payments, it is impractical to prevent all improper payments. A January 2008 report by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) indicated that Medicare is among the top three Federal programs with improper payments, totaling an estimated $10.8 billion in 2007. <br /><br />Improper payments on claims can occur for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Payments are made for services that do not meet Medicare's medical necessity criteria.<br /><br />Payments are made for services that are incorrectly coded. <br />Other reasons, such as basing claim payments on outdated fee schedules, or the provider is paid twice because duplicate claims were submitted. <br />Medicare pays a claim that should have been paid by a different health insurance company (called Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) improper payments)<br /><br />There is growing concern that the Medicare Trust Funds may not be adequately protected against erroneous payment through current administrative procedures. Therefore, CMS is undertaking a project to determine if there are Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) software products that can automatically (without requiring human intervention) identify Medicare FFS claims for which payment should be denied.<br /><br /><br /><br />CMS is interested in a product(s) that:<br /><br />a. Only flag claims that can be auto-denied (i.e., do not require human review and are supported by clear policy). The term "clear policy" means a statute, regulation, National Coverage Determination (NCD), coverage provision in an interpretive manual, Local Coverage Determinations, or Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) article that specifies the circumstances under which an item/service will always be considered non-covered, incorrectly coded, or improperly billed; <br /><br />b. Never flags a claim that requires human review; <br /><br />c. Never flags a claim where the denial is not supported by clear policy; <br /><br />d. Accurately communicates what action should be taken on the flagged claim (full denial, partial denial, etc). In the case of a downcode, the product must indicate the new code to which the claim should be downcoded; <br /><br />e. Has the ability to mark each flagged claim with a Medicare-defined reason code; <br /><br />f. Has the ability to handle large volumes of claims (e.g. approximately 4.5 million claims per business day). <br /><br />g. Can provide an audit trail on actions taken on claims (denied on a specified date, etc) and that this information is available to authorized users via an interactive web-based application. <br /><br />h. Can provide statistical/workload reports such as number (and dollar value) of claims received from CMS in a given month, number (and dollar value) of full denials made that month, auto-deny rate (number of claims denied out of number of claims received), auto-deny dollar rate (dollars auto-denied per dollar claim paid and that these reports and statistics are available to authorized users via an interactive web-based application. <br /><br />i. Has the ability to turn off one or more edits within 1 hour of notification. <br /><br />j. Can edit across all claim types. If the product can only edit certain claim types please provide details. <br /><br />k. Can be modified to fit existing architectures. Describe if the product is adaptable to integration into existing environments such as an Enterprise Data Center or must the product run outside of the CMS environment; and, <br /><br />l. Can accept an input file from the CMS Common Working File and can submit a response file to the CMS Common working File in a CMS specified format. The layout of the input file and response file will be provided at a later date. <br /><br />In summation, CMS is seeking a single contractor who can provide automated editing software system (i.e., review claims without human intervention) across all claim types tailored to Medicare fee-for-service rules and policies for the best value possible. Award of the contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the offeror whose proposal and product best meets the government requirements. In order to meet government requirements CMS reserves the right to make a single award or multiple awards. In addition, CMS also reserves the right to amended or canceled the solicitation as necessary to meet CMS requirements.</p>
<p>The anticipated award date of the IDIQ and Task Order 0001 is September 30, 2010. <br /><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The Government will not evaluate responses or accept phone calls in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THIS CONTRACTING OFFICER. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT THE NANES PROVIDED BELOW.
Overview: EFVS technology currently utilizes infrared technology as a key means of enhancing visibility.  These requirements include the ability to see the visual cues required by FAR 91.175. These visual cues include airport approach lights, threshold lights, runway end identifier lights, touchdown zone lights or runway lights. The implementation and use of LED approach, runway, and taxiway lighting as a means of compliance to the Energy Independence and Security Act poses a challenge to current EFVS operators due to the lack of infrared energy with common LED lighting 
Due to EFVS growing operational flexibility and given that both LED lighting and EFVS have cost and energy saving benefits a cooperative approach between energy efficient lighting and EFVS performance is sought.
SAE is pleased to invite you to participate in an initial meeting of a new committee to consider Enhanced Flight Vision Systems and the current &future challenge with respect to the upgrade of airport lighting systems from incandescent to energy efficient lighting sources per the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Sec 321, Efficient Light Bulbs.

<DESC><strong>Synopsis</strong><br /><br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process.  This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future IARPA program, so that feedback from potential participants can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA.  Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below.  Additionally, responses to this request may be used to i) inform a two day workshop (explained below), and/or ii) support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA Program BAA. Therefore, responses must be available for unrestricted public distribution and hence proprietary material should not be included in responses.  The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.<br /><br /><strong>Background &amp; Scope</strong><br /><br />In the last decade, advancements in computer technology have made 3D, multimodal, multi-sensory, and increasingly realistic simulated experiences more commonly available through virtual worlds (VW) and immersive computer games.  VWs and computer games are now being used for serious applications in a number of areas. Affordable, virtual medical simulations for training surgeons, combat medics and first responders are now available.  The military has built games that aim to teach soldiers cultural awareness and sensitivity to local customs and norms.  Companies are exploring virtual worlds as an effective alternative to in-person staff orientation and training.  Virtual world and game applications have recently been shown to be effective in lifestyle changes and therapy for smoking cessation, exercise, weight loss, adherence to treatment protocols, and treatment of phobias and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  See for example (Footnote 1,2)  .<br /><br />Most of the examples listed above have used virtual environments focused on a particular end goal.  Other researchers have suggested that these environments may also have positive, unintended consequences.  For example, researchers have found that surgeons who played computer games were faster and had fewer errors in a laparoscopic surgery training course, than surgeons who were not gamers (Footnote 3).  <br /><br />Some individuals claim that gaming can enhance problem-solving skills, critical thinking, teamwork, and persistence in the face of adversity (Footnote 4,5), although the amount of empirical research in this area is relatively sparse.  In the Intelligence Community and in the field of business intelligence in general, such skills are highly desirable.  It is well-known that analysts can be hampered by problems of groupthink, premature attachment to early hypotheses, confirmation bias, and cultural bias, for example.  Might gaming environments provide an antidote (Footnote 6,7)?<br /><br />As cited above, studies to date support the proposition that immersive environments can affect Real World (RW) performance, but much of the previous research has been focused on case studies and gross-level effects.  Few metrics have been developed for identifying and measuring a game or virtual environment's variables or features that correlate with these positive effects.<br /><br />IARPA is interested in focused, quantitative research to understand how virtual worlds and immersive games may have RW effects, particularly those effects that could positively impact individual and group analytic performance. What are the important VW (and RW) environmental variables that control the strength and persistence of such effects? Examples of variables include, but are not limited to: degree of fidelity, image and sound quality, level of immersion, amount of repetition, social effects, narrative structure, language skills, and cultural background.<br /><br />Submissions should be theory-driven, and any prospective VW or game development, along with experimental paradigms to test their effectiveness, should be informed by existing or new theories.  Theories may be derived from a number of disciplines, including but not limited to:  education, clinical psychology, social psychology, health care, or neurology.
<p>Submissions may also address one or more of the following topics:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.	Alternative virtual environments, ranging from Virtual Reality rooms to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desktop/laptop applications to mobile handheld devices/applications<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.	Quantitative methods for reliably predicting and objectively measuring<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expected RW effects and actual RW effects due to the complex variables, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; including longitudinal effects<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.	Literature reviews or perspectives on research.  Research does not need<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be directly related to analytic processes, but may be based in other <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; domains such as VWs for education/training, or gaming for health.</p>
<p><br />The responses to this RFI will be used to help in the planning of a one to two day workshop. The results of this workshop may justify a multi-year competitive program. The selection of topics, participants, and setting of the agenda of this workshop will in part be informed by the responses, with responders potentially being invited to participate and present at this workshop. It is anticipated that this workshop will be held in May 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation Instructions to Respondents</strong></p>
<p>IARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program.  IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and a rough order of magnitude cost estimate of the proposed approach.  This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.</p>
<p>IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the US.  Responses leveraging insights from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged.  Responses have the following formatting requirements: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.	A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPA-RFI-10-04;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.	A substantive, focused, one-half page executive summary; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.	A description (limited to a maximum of 5 pages in minimum 12 point <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins) of the technical challenges and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suggested approach(es);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.	A list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.	Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ideas.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY ISAVAILABLE ONLY TO SIA CONSTRUCTION, INC. UNDER CONTRACT NNJ09JA26C, AS AUTHORIZED UNDERTHE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. NASA intends to install Spun Aluminum Vent Caps instead of Polyethylene (Plastic) VentCaps on the roof being repaired on Building 9 (S) at the NASA/Johnson Space Center (JSC). Vent Caps are one-way valves that open to relieve moisture vapor pressure from theroofing systems and then close to prevent moisture from re-entering the roofing system. Due to leaks caused by Hurricane IKE, moisture has become trapped within the existinglightweight concrete deck in the Building 9 (S) roofing system. The installation of theVent Caps will prevent blistering, delamination and billowing of the roofing membranesystem that could be caused by the release of the trapped moisture in the LightweightInsulation Concrete (LIC).  Polyethylene (Plastic) Vent Caps are more susceptible to deterioration due to heat overtime and have been known to crack or break if struck by an object.  A change to the typeof Vent Caps to be installed is required to provide a more reliable roofing systembecause the Spun Aluminum Vent Caps are more durable than the Polyethylene (Plastic) VentCaps that have a higher probability of resulting in a future roof leak if they were todeteriorate over time or become damaged.NASA/JSC intends to issue modification 3 to Contract NNJ09JA26C, a firm fixed pricedcontract awarded to SIA Construction, Inc. under the Small Business Administration 8(a)program, using the Partnership Agreement between NASA and the Small BusinessAdministration in accordance with FAR 19.8 and the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5).

<DESC>Background: The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Retrieval Group (Information Access Division/Information Technology Laboratory) runs large-scale evaluations of information retrieval systems such as document retrieval, question answering, and summarization systems.
<p>The work of the NIST Information Technology Laboratory, Information Access Division Retrieval Group includes a set of projects whose purpose is to foster the development of computer systems that are able to analyze and manipulate the information content of artifacts originally constructed for consumption by humans.</p>
<p>The artifacts of interest include video/image data such as produced television shows, the raw footage from which a final show is drawn, and consumer-generated video. The artifacts can be manipulated in a variety of ways, each of which defines a task for a computer system: find related artifacts; extract specific facts from artifacts; summarize a set of artifacts; find artifacts that express a given opinion, or discuss a given event or person; etc. The projects conducted by the NIST Retrieval Group strive to extend this paradigm to the evaluation of systems that use multimedia queries to research large collections of digital video.<br /><br />The end result of this particular project is to use the information gathered from the results to modify, test or improve existing search engines and also to develop new state of the art search engines. Also, this information shall be shared with universities around the USA that are developing new ways to search for data on the web. This project is part of the NIST mission of "promoting U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement in science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life". With this project NIST strives to advance the existing technology and to help create new technologies that help to improve our way of life. <br /><br />Scope of this Acquisition: This presolicitation notice is for a noncommercial services acquisition in the area of video search systems testing through the use of video queries and assessments. NIST intends to solicit this acquisition under the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (which are for acquisitions valued up to $100,000). NIST also intends to compete this acquisition as a Total Small Business Set Aside under the NAICS code 541990, with a small business size standard of $7.0 million. The period of performance is anticipated to be less than one year. The Government intends to utilize the firm-fixed-price contract type for these services because it is feasible for the Government to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with a reasonable degree of confidence.<br /><br />Availability of Solicitation: NIST intends to post the solicitation on www.fbo.gov on or about 16 days after this notice is posted. Quotations will be due no later than 10 days after the solicitation is posted on www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Requirement for Active Registration in CCR: Each Offeror must have an active registration at www.ccr.gov to be eligible to receive an award under this acquisition.</p>
<p>All questions regarding this acquisition shall be directed by email to the primary point of contact: Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Hiden Analytical, Inc. of Peterborough, New Hampshire for the purchase of a Computer-Controlled Gas Delivery System.<br />NIST cites FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: NIST Ceramics Division will be conducting studies at different temperature-pressure conditions using an existing XRD instrument that contains a special chamber for non-ambient experiments with a temperature control unit. The introduction of gas mixtures into the non-ambient XRD chamber requires a gas delivery system capable of delivering and actively regulating gas composition, mass flow rates and total pressure. The XCS (Extreme Climate Systems) product offered by Hiden Analytical is the only commercially available system capable of delivering and actively regulating temperature, environment composition and optionally, the total pressure. This control is within an existing chamber such as the sample housing of an existing spectrometer, or within a bespoke chamber including glove box designs. Hiden Analytical is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this product. As a result, Hiden Analytical is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on March 26, 2010. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joshua.holliday@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>This is a Presolicitation notice for the previously posted Sources Sought notice <strong>#NIHES2009073</strong> entitled <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparation of the Report on Carcinogens.<br /></span>
<p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is soliciting proposals for the purpose of providing Support for the Preparations of the Report on Carcinogens. The objective of this project is to procure assistance in preparing the Report on Carcinogens and documents used in its scientific review process.  The RoC is a congressionally mandated public document that lists agents, substances, mixtures or exposure circumstances that are known or reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens.  This contract shall perform tasks associated with the fulfillment of three requirement types: 1) preparation of scientific documents 2) Logistics of scientific review meetings and 3) preparation of the RoC in a desktop publishing format.</p>
<p>Preparation of Scientific Documents:<br />The Contractor shall provide support to the RoC Center for preparing multiple scientific documents with different levels of complexity based on 1) types of peer-reviewed literature cited - primary (original studies) or secondary references (reviews or peer-reviewed evaluations),   2) number of cited references, 3) writing style -"study by study" approach, that is a summary of the design, methods, results, and conclusions for individual studies, or "review" style, that is a summary of major findings across studies.  All the documents shall contain information on the following topics; however, the degree of detail written on each topic will vary depending on the purpose of the document (e.g., nomination or substance review document) and the subject matter (e.g., substance under review). Topics include:  1) Introduction and description of the properties (e.g., chemical, physical or biological) of the substance 2) Human Exposure 3) Human Cancer Studies 4) Studies in Experimental Animals.</p>
<p>Logistics of scientific review meetings:<br />The Contractor shall be responsible for the logistics of convening meetings related to the scientific review of substances under consideration for possible listing or de-listing in the RoC.  Duties include, but are not limited to 1) Securing a venue and equipment 2) Preparation, printing and dissemination of meeting materials for participants, government staff and the public and 3) Travel arrangements for invited participants.</p>
<p>Preparation of the RoC in a desktop publishing format:<br />For each new edition of the RoC, the Contractor shall update the carcinogenicity, production, use, exposure and regulatory sections of profiles for approximately 25 of the substances that are currently listed in the RoC. The Contractor shall provide scientific/administrative support for creating the RoC draft, which is a compilation of the new and current substance profiles and relevant tables, appendices, and indexes. This task includes updating some of the various components of the RoC, providing chemical structures for the listed chemicals, checking for technical accuracy, and copy editing. The Contractor shall prepare the preliminary draft of the RoC in desktop publishing format.</p>
<p>Mandatory Requirements</p>
<p>Geographical proximity <br />The Contractor staff (key personnel, technical and administrative) shall be located within 30 minutes of NIEHS because of (1) frequent impromptu meetings between Contractor personnel and the Project Officer and RoC Center staff to complete work under strict deadlines, and (2) the location of the scientific review meetings which will take place (both on-site at NIEHS and at off-site venues) in the Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC vicinity. This proximity will aid in the RoC Center's continual in-person collaborative work on documents with the Contractor. Past scientific review meetings required most of the Contractor's staff and also involve several pre-meeting site visits.</p>
<p>Staff<br />The key scientific personnel shall be employees of the Contractor and not sub-contractors or consultants. For the Key positions not filled at time of initial submissions, a letter of commitment and CV from proposed personnel should be included at the time of receipt of FPR.</p>
<p>Equipment and software<br />The Contractor shall perform their work using a Macintosh platform and Apple computer hardware in order to eliminate cross-platform technical problems. The preparation of scientific documents requires numerous exchanges of documents, and cross-platform translation problems (such as style and font concerns, incorrect scientific symbols, misaligned data tables, and pagination errors) can affect efficiency.</p>
<p>One contract will be awarded. The anticipated period of performance is five years.  The government estimate of direct labor is approximately 12,840 direct labor hours over the five year contract period.  This is only an estimate of direct labor.  The Government anticipates the participation of senior research professionals (i.e. Principal Investigator, Senior Scientist, technical, etc) such as toxicologists, epidemiologists, technical/scientific writers, scientific copy editors, administrative support, etc.  The anticipated award date is November 30, 2010. This is a requirement for a 100% total small business set-aside.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code identified for this requirement is 511130 with a size standard of 500 employees.  The expected release date of the RFP is March 31, 2010 with proposals due May 17, 2010.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) located in Bethesda, MD on the National Naval Medical Campus, intends to negotiate, on a single source basis per FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), a one-year service and supply contract with Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc., 1 Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594, (038376674), for a network license for Axiovision imaging analysis software.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures, as stated in FAR 13.106(b)(1) and in accordance with FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items).

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">USUHS has determined that Carl Zeiss Microimaging is the only reasonably available source to meet the government&rsquo;s requirement. The research community at USU already owns several Carl Zeiss imaging systems, including four (4) systems in the Biomedical Instrumentation Center (BIC) core facility, and this software is guaranteed to be 100% compatible with the data generated on those systems. Further, the Interactive Measurement module and the Automeasure module provide an ease of measurement and analysis for 3D datasets that is unmatched. In addition, the Inside4D module allows for easier 3D and 4D visualizations of complex datasets. All of these modules work seamlessly with data from Carl Zeiss hardware currently in use at USU. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This is the only source known to USUHS which can meet this requirement, as it is the only known software that is compatible with existing imaging systems. This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has a principal task to conduct research and development (R&D) for the next generation of technologies in support of the U.S. Department of Energys (DOE) Fuel Cell Technologies and Vehicle Technologies Programs.  NRELs support for the DOE programs integrates research and development, assessment of technology, manufacturing, and commercialization status and readiness, cross-cutting manufacturing R&D, market transformation, technical validation, computer modeling, outreach and other activities.  In addition to value-added work on fuel cells and other alternative fuel technologies, the integration of these technologies with other renewable energy technologies, and dissemination of the information is of increasing importance. 

NREL seeks sources to assist NREL in supporting the DOE and industry across these integrated activities on an as needed basis. The support required is excellent technical writing, communication, and customer service skills, working knowledge of alternative fuels and fuel cell technologies, and the ability to assist NREL with identifying future work needed to move the technologies forward.  The main focus is on fuel cell manufacturing and analysis/modeling.  The codes and standards focus is minimal.  Activities are anticpated to be participation in meetings and reporting back to NREL as well as participation in outreach activities to help improve those activities.

The effort will include the following:
Meet with industry and other pertinent organizations to gather research, technology, manufacturing, and commercialization information, as well as other information as requested;  Provide technical support to NREL; Report findings to NREL on a regular basis, as well as on an as-requested basis.

Type of effort is envisioned as follows:
Analysis:
1.	Perform analysis of codes and standards to identify gaps and make recommendations about how these gaps could be addressed
2.	Perform computational analyses, such as modeling analyses, to evaluate hazards and definite prevention and mitigation strategies
3.	Provide assistance on analysis of real-world stationary fuel cell installations to better inform stakeholders about both potential benefits and potential financial and technological risks.  These installations will include, but are not limited to, backup power, combined heat and power, and combined heat, hydrogen and power, and biogas installations.  
4.	Techno-economic analysis involving the use of the Fuel Cell Power model, as well as any other analytic support models needed to better understand particular installations or larger energy systems, such as use of hydrogen in vehicles or electricity arbitrage scenarios.  
5.

<p>Request for Information for Emergency Logistical Staging and Support Services in Response to Large Scale Animal Disease Outbreaks</p>
<p>Statement of Need<br />The National Veterinary Stockpile (NVS, an emergency program of the US Department of Agriculture's Animal &amp; Plant Health Inspection Service) exists to provide states the resources they need to fight dangerous animal diseases that could potentially devastate American agriculture, seriously affect the economy, and threaten the public's health. <br />The NVS seeks information from industry on its availability to provide turnkey emergency services in support of warehouse facilities and operations during large scale animal disease outbreaks. Turnkey means providing the necessary skilled personnel, management, equipment (e.g. warehouse and material handling equipment, trucks, refrigeration units, communications, and vehicles), materials, permits, inventory management tools, certifications and training, to set up and provide warehouse and cold storage (vaccine storage) and distribution support services for the duration of major disease outbreaks. Potential major disease response could last months and may include diseases that can affect both animals and people such as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, Rift Valley Fever, or disease that only affect animals such as Foot and Mouth Disease, Exotic Newcastle Disease, and Classical Swine Fever. <br />The 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak in the United Kingdom demonstrates the scale and duration of an animal disease outbreak. This seven month operation resulted in depopulating and disposing of 3.9 million hoofed animals (cows, swine, sheep) on over 9,300 farms and cost $14B. Ultimately it involved the British Army to halt the spread of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Once a State Veterinarian determines that it does not have the sufficient resources to flight such diseases it requests assistance from the NVS. In response, the NVS will deploy within 24 hours critical veterinary countermeasures (e.g. supplies, equipment, vaccines, and field diagnostic tests). The state(s) will receive, process, and deliver the countermeasures to responders in the field (farm(s)). The intent of this request is to determine industry's ability to augment local logistical storing, staging and supplying countermeasures to multiple field locations for the duration of an outbreak.</p>
<p>The NVS seeks vendors who can provide such services using demonstrated methods.</p>
<p>Vendor Capabilities and Experience</p>
<p>The NVS would like to talk to vendors with the following or similar capabilities and experience: <br />&bull; Emergency response experience setting up and running logistical operations. <br />&bull; Practical experience working within an incident command system during emergencies.<br />&bull; An understanding of the National Response Plan, <br />&bull; Knowledge of the USDA and state animal disease response plans is a plus. <br />&bull; The ability response within 48 hours to potentially identify (states may or may not have pre-identified locations) and set up warehouse operations for the duration of large animal disease outbreaks. <br />&bull; Experience managing large scale (50+ responders under direct supervision) emergency response operations. Previous experience operating emergency logistics centers for government agencies is highly desirable. <br />&bull; Capability of responding to multiple outbreaks/responses simultaneously.<br />&bull; Ability to scale operations to meet the demands of responses as they increase in size.<br />&bull; Experience working with federal and state governments.<br />Information Requested<br />If you believe you meet the above criteria, please send an email by 03/09/2010 to <br />nvs@aphis.usda.gov<br />with a summary of your qualifications and experience. Include the following: <br />&bull; Company name<br />&bull; Contact information, <br />&bull; Government contracts, BOA, GSA if applicable<br />&bull; Web site URL, <br />&bull; Number of fulltime employees,<br />&bull; Capability to provide qualified surge manpower and equipment, <br />&bull; Subcontractors and role, <br />&bull; References from large scale responses, and the location, summary of operation, size and duration of relevant responses,<br />&bull; Previous experience and any value-added qualifications or tools. <br />For any other questions please contact Larry Nelson at: Larry.D.Nelson@aphis.usda.gov</p>

<DESC>Market Survey:  Procurement of FE-Safe Software Package with Verity, Licenses plus Right to Use and Maintenance Enhancement Support.

The United States Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Center, on behalf of the Analysis & Evaluation Technology Division within the Munitions Engineering Technology Center of the US Army RDECOM is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources that are capable of providing the Fe-Safe Software Package that can be utilized for extending functionality of modeling advanced materials for fatigue and that is compatible with ABAQUS.   The Analysis & Evaluation Technology Division is a functional element within the Fuze and Precision Munitions Technology Directorate in the Munitions Engineering and Technology Center.  The mission of the AETD is to perform engineering analysis on all armaments in all stages of development and production.  This analysis includes static structural analysis, dynamic structural analysis, computation fluid dynamics, electrical component analysis, electrical system analysis, sensor performance analysis, reliability analysis, manufacturing tolerance analyses, and process capability analyses.  The division employs a specialized group of scientific, engineering and technical personnel specifically focused on the design and analysis of electrical systems and mechanical structures developed for high g applications  specializing in gun launch survivability.  The AETD mission is to support design developments and improve our scientific, engineering and technical expertise in order to minimize time that is required to transform ideas to a precision weapon system in the soldiers hands. The AETD currently utilizes the ABAQUS software suite in order to support this mission.   Currently, the ABAQUS software suite is fully installed and utilized as the key Finite Element Analysis (FEA) code that AETD employs to accomplish their high quality engineering analysis tasks.  

Because all of ARDECs designed precision munitions such as the Excalibur projectile comprise of complex geometries and complex load cycles, the AETD must utilize a finite element (FE) based fatigue analysis to model key components susceptible to fatigue.  Fatigue Analyses with FE-Safe and ABAQUS is a post processing operation thus,  the FE-Safe software allows our engineers to consider fatigue and durability early in product design minimizing expensive prototype testing, leading to more high tech, streamlined and cost effective reliable components to support the Warfighter.  Auxiliary FEA applications must be fully compatible and functional with the ABAQUS FEA software suites currently utilized at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ.   


Interested respondents should include information that provides evidence of experience in the following areas:
1.	Ability to provide Maintenance, Enhancement and Support Periods for each FE-Safe Software Package.
2.	Ability to provide improvements and updates to the FE-Safe software suite as are generally made available to other licensees of FE-Safe Software Programs.  
3.	Ability to provide Customers assistance as necessary to cause each FE-Safe Program to perform in accordance with the specifications set forth in the FE-Safe Program manuals.

This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government. No award will be made as a result of this market survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<BR><BR>Augmented Reality (AR) Systems  <BR>Technology Roadmap Survey<BR> <BR>Dismounted Soldier Applications <BR><BR>Final Version_3-12-2010<BR><BR><BR>Purpose for the Request for Information (RFI):<BR><BR>This is not a solicitation for contract.  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to survey Industry, Academia and Other Government Agencies (OGA) in order to collect information and data that would be useful for the development of a comprehensive technology roadmap for the development of augmented reality capabilities for dismounted soldier applications.  Companies, universities and agencies interested in pursuing future research and development opportunities with the U.S. Army are invited to respond to this RFI.  [NOTE:  If travelling to Orlando, in the near future, capability briefings and technical interchange meetings with the Government are possible, with sufficient advanced notice]. <BR><BR>The Roadmap will be a planning tool that addresses research, development, technology insertion, production, fielding, and effective use of augmented reality systems for dismounted soldier training.  Upon completion, the Roadmap will be a living document that will support:<BR><BR>Identification of R&D trends within private industry, academia and other government agencies, in the field of augmented reality and related technologies.<BR><BR>US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements writers in the assessment of current and future army training requirements and identification of technology gaps and shortfalls.  <BR><BR>US Army Research, Development & Engineering Command (RDECOM) Science & Technology (S&T) managers in developing suitable and effective AR solutions that address identified technology shortfalls. <BR><BR>US Armys planning, funding and future implementation of Army Technology Objectives (ATOs), Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, Technology Demonstrations (TDs), etc. in this technology area.<BR><BR>Open dialogue for the leveraging of internal research and development (IR&D) efforts of industry, academia and other government agencies, towards current and future Army Force Operating Capabilities and Technology Shortfalls.<BR><BR>This survey covers a seven year planning, programming, budgeting, and execution period including FY10 (Current Year), FY11 (Next Year) and period FY12 through FY17 (Future Years Defense Plan).<BR><BR> <BR>Research Vision:<BR>The current generation of mixed and augmented reality systems technology, in use for military training relies mainly on the employment of large digital flat screens, chromo-key (blue/green) screens, CAVE environments, etc. and other projection-based techniques.  The Army seeks a next-generation approach that would eliminate the need for one-of-a-kind brick & mortar facilities, large stand alone simulators and their associated costs.  AR for dismounted soldier applications must provide a low-cost, man-wearable system that uses minimal infrastructure, site prep and set up time; and can be used at home station and while deployed.<BR><BR><BR>Program Objective:<BR>The Army seeks to explore methods of presenting 2D/3D virtual objects (representing various types of targets, fire and effects, friendly forces and opposition forces, civilians on the battlefield (COB), vehicles, etc.) to the dismounted soldier while operating both indoors and outdoors, on various types of live training environments.  Additionally, the trainee would be capable of interacting with virtual targets, personnel, vehicles, etc. as though real.  The objective is to create an interactive, multi-sensory, non-linear environment that provides the Warfighter with training that is unparalleled in flexibility and realism.  <BR><BR>The resulting technology roadmap will support RDECOMs overall program objective for this technology area, which is to develop, improve and mature a dismounted soldier AR prototype for demonstration in a relevant environment--technology readiness level (TRL) 6 for discrete applications (e.g. forward observer, call for fire, escalation of force decision making, etc.).  Transitioning of targeted system and subsystem components to other military technology and acquisition programs is also an important objective.  <BR>.  <BR><BR>Notional R&D Capability Objectives and Timeline:<BR><BR>Threshold (1  2 Years):  man wearable capability within a fully instrumented AR environment, while training individual tasks<BR><BR>Objective (3 - 5 Years):  man wearable capability within a minimally instrumented AR environment, while training individual and squad level collective tasks<BR><BR>Long Range End-State Objective (5+ Years):  man wearable capability within a non-instrumented AR environment, while training individual and squad+ level collective tasks<BR><BR>In the future, these same concepts and technologies would potentially allow for situational awareness, communications, map data, etc. to be provided to Warfighters in complex operational environments without impeding their live view.<BR><BR><BR>Planned CORE R&D Topics:<BR>Based on past research efforts, the Army has identified several broad research topics that must be effectively integrated together to implement an effective, real-time augmented reality system for the dismounted soldier:<BR><BR>Multi-Sensor Fusion for Position Tracking and Pose Estimation/Recovery<BR>Investigate techniques leading to robust man-worn tracking systems based on multiple/hybrid sensor packages, using sophisticated filtering algorithms.  These systems would accurately sense, track and co-relate the dismounted soldiers position (head, eyes, body, weapon, etc.) in the real environment to virtual objects in the associated virtual environment.  Systems would be mobile and operate free (tether-less) from any infrastructure; whether indoors or outdoors. (Fixed site and range applications may make use of appropriate tracking infrastructure; including markers and marker-less tracking techniques.)<BR><BR>Real-Time Static/Dynamic Object Occlusion Mapping and Rendering<BR>Investigate techniques leading to the realistic display of virtual 3-D objects and images through the dismounted soldiers live field of view.  These systems would support accurate distance measurement, depth perception, etc. of natural features and man-made objects that are tracked within the training environment.  The resulting data and measurements would facilitate accurate and realistic occlusion, placement and rendering of virtual objects that would be displayed in a compelling, realistic and believable manner.<BR><BR>AR Environment Modeling, Mapping and Database Management<BR>Investigate low-cost, rapid ( less than 48 hrs) live terrain modeling techniques that would support execution and performance of associated Multi-Sensor Fusion for Position Tracking & Pose Recovery and Real-Time Static/Dynamic Occlusion Mapping and Rendering capabilities.<BR><BR>Support Interfaces, Instrumentation & Infrastructure<BR>Investigate components, devices, techniques and methods for implementing realistic augmented reality in various types of military training environments, including but not limited to military operations on urban terrain (MOUT) sites, maneuver ranges, firing ranges, test ranges, etc.<BR><BR>Head Mounted Displays Technologies<BR>Investigate rugged, low cost, high resolution head mounted displays (HMD) as the primary human interface for the dismounted soldiers view into the augmented reality environment.  These HMDs would be of the optical see-through design (the subject sees the live environment, directly through the HMD); and made of rugged, light-weight materials.  This topic includes associated wireless video transmission techniques for tether-less HMD operation.    <BR><BR>Miscellaneous Topics. <BR>Investigate miscellaneous technologies, tools and techniques that may expand and increase future AR capabilities and explore opportunities to develop spin-off technologies, e.g. <BR><BR>Networking and communications capabilities<BR>High performance computing (man-wore and remote) capabilities<BR>Interactive tele-presence and holographic capabilities<BR>AI enabled virtual human interaction <BR>Integrating the AR enabled dismounted soldier with existing simulators across the live, virtual and constructive training domains<BR>etc.<BR><BR>Human Performance and Training Effectiveness.  <BR>Investigate techniques and programs of experimentation on human perception in AR.  Issues may include research on design of the human system interface; prevalence of simulator sickness or other side effects, especially as a function of system characteristics or conditions of use; strategies for using AR in dismounted soldier training, and their effectiveness in both skill acquisition and transfer; fidelity requirements for effective training and transfer, etc.<BR><BR><BR>Industry, Academia and OGA Response Guidelines:<BR>The following are suggested guidelines for the type of information that would be most useful in the development of the U.S. Armys Augmented Reality Technology Roadmap: <BR><BR>1.	Provide information that describes your company or organizations background, capabilities, and areas of expertise.<BR><BR>2.

<DESC>The Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, &amp; Explosives is issuing this Request for Information in response to a requirement for a new distribution service contract. The Government is only gathering information. The Government intends to work specifically with an 8(a) Alaskan Native Corporation Owned Company. The source sought is being issued as a requirement for market research.
<p>All interested sources that are 8(a) Alaskan Native Corporation Owned Companies are encouraged to submit their company and product literature, references, and other pertinent information for the Government's consideration. Below are the specific details the Government is requesting for the new distribution service contract. Companies capabilities statements must show that they will be able to meet or exceed the below specifics for consideration of a possible long term contract.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)</p>
<p>1.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) (hereinafter referred to as "ATF") is a law enforcement organization within the United States Department of Justice--dedicated to reducing violent crime and protecting the public. ATF performs the dual responsibilities of enforcing Federal criminal laws and regulating the firearms and explosives industries and is committed to working directly, and through partnerships, to investigate and reduce crime involving firearms and explosives.</p>
<p>ATF currently maintains a national distribution contract that encompasses uniform and equipment acquisition, distribution, and management services. The services provided help meet ATF's responsibilities under Federal law, regulation, and Executive Order relative to the mission stated above. It is structured to ensure that products and services deliver tangible and meaningful benefits, and that every economic or technological opportunity is taken advantage of as it relates to uniforms, investigative equipment, and personal protective equipment used by field personnel.</p>
<p><br />2.0 INTRODUCTION OF NEED</p>
<p>ATF contemplates entering in a potential $30 million distribution service contract, to include one (1) base year and four (4) optional years for the purchase, inventory management, and distribution of ATF- owned uniforms, investigative equipment, and personal protective equipment. Onsite customization of certain uniform items by screen printing and embroidery will also be required.</p>
<p>ATF has a requirement to provide basic duty uniforms, investigative equipment and personal protective equipment to its special agents, industry operations investigators (IOI), explosives enforcement officers, firearms enforcement officers, and other authorized users in an efficient and cost effective manner. It is expected that the service provider ("service provider" will refer to any person or business entity that submits a response to this SOW) will be responsible for the acquisition, storage, protection, and distribution of such uniform, investigative equipment, and personal protective equipment items. These duties will be executed in a manner that will provide superior customer service, logistical management of ATF-owned property, and minimal ATF administrative involvement.</p>
<p>3.0 SCOPE OF SERVICES</p>
<p>The national distribution service contract ATF seeks to enter encompasses the full range of uniform acquisition, distribution, and management services required to meet ATF's responsibilities under Federal legislation and executive orders.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Ready accessibility to a multitude of specialized products and manufacturers<br />Acquisition of approved orders<br />Automated tracking of approved orders<br />Receipt of such approved orders<br />Automated inventory management and stock accountability of such orders<br />Distribution of ATF-owned uniforms, investigative equipment, and personal protective equipment<br />Kitting and assembling (a process to create a customized kit of related items/materials that is assembled and shipped as one unit)<br />A secure, web-based application with multiple hosting options to facilitate funding and inventory accountability, particularly:</p>
<p>&bull; individual user accounts that can track individual purchases and allow for multiple funding mechanisms</p>
<p>&bull; the embedding of documents and videos necessary to provide sizing or kitting instructions and/or examples</p>
<p>&bull; forecasting and trend analysis to aid in funding allocations and equipment replacement schedules</p>
<p>&bull; reports that provide analyses of ordering/shipping times, fulfillment of orders, and types of equipment purchased, to include total purchase for previous years</p>
<p>The service provider is responsible for providing all necessary staff and having an existing infrastructure to support this distribution service contract, to include all supplies, materials, equipment, and a robust, online operational and logistical accountability tool. The distribution facility must meet all Federal, State, and local fire and safety requirements. Furthermore, the facility(s) must maintain a fire/intruder alarm system that is monitored 24 hours a day by an alarm company, fire department, and/or police department.</p>
<p>The service provider will be available Monday through Friday during core business hours (8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., EST). The service provider will provide a full-time project manager and an alternate for all work performed under this contract. The project manager will be accessible by phone 24 hours a day, and must return phone calls received from the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) or co-COTR within 1 hour.</p>
<p>The project manager will attend, participate in, and provide input to various meetings, briefings, and teleconferences with ATF representatives. The project manager may initiate teleconferences, especially when unusual or unexpected situations arise. All such communications must be initiated through ATF's COTR.</p>
<p>The service provider will be responsible for establishing a transition plan from the current distribution provider outlining the sequence of events and actions that need to be accomplished, without disruption of services. This sequence of events and actions include:</p>
<p>&bull; the procedures and any necessary resources for accomplishing each action</p>
<p>&bull; the period of time needed to accomplish each action</p>

<p>&bull;&nbsp; an approach for transitioning the inventory as well as the ATF data from the distribution management system of the current distribution provider</p>
<p>The service provider must have mechanisms in place to ensure quality control, to include:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;audit procedures to identify areas adversely affecting contract performance</p>
<p>&bull; a problem identification and resolution process and a method for monitoring corrective action</p>
<p>&bull; a system for tracking incoming and outgoing orders and the timeliness of deliveries accomplished by both the service provider and vendors</p>
<p>&bull; a system for recording, computing, accumulating, maintaining, and providing access to data so that the service provider and ATF can use it for analysis and decision making</p>
<p>&bull; a method to monitor the accuracy and completeness of ATF data in the service provider's inventory management and distribution system</p>
<p>4.0 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS</p>

<p>4.2.1 Marketplace Changes. It is expected that the service provider will continuously assess and evaluate the uniform and equipment marketplace to ensure that the highest quality items are being purchased at the best possible price.

<p>4.3 Order Tracking. The service provider will electronically model and track the flow of all apparel and non-apparel item orders, to include automated notifications to the purchaser of order completion. These orders will be tracked by individual user and/or by contract buying activities on such parameters as order status, individual request status, approvals and approval trail documentation by item and/or dollar amount, status updates, and tracking number used by the delivery service.</p>
<p>4.4 Order Delivery. In the absence of specific instructions, the service provider will choose a delivery method that will get the order to the customer as required, be it an ATF office or individual employee. The service provider will be responsible for all costs associated with the delivery. It is understood that such costs may pass to ATF in the cost of the item ordered. Bulk orders/stock purchases, kit assemblies, and/or products that require special handling and packaging will be received at the distribution facility. The service provider will receive, inspect, and accept all incoming shipments to the facility. For each order shipment, the service provider shall generate a listing of the products included in the order shipment.

<p>4.5 Inventory Management. The service provider will perform inventory management activities to account for all orders placed, received, issued, and maintained. Products received at the distribution facility are considered inventory from the time of receipt by the service provider to the time they are issued to the delivery carrier. The service provider will assign and maintain stock locations/bin assignments for warehoused items as well as ensure accountability for that stock. Warehouses may vary by geographic location, and be permanent or temporary units.</p>
<p>4.5.1 Inventory and Distribution System. The service provider will provide real-time, continuous electronic access to a web-based application that facilitates funding and inventory accountability and supports ATF's distribution activities. It is understood that the capabilities of the system can be refined to fit the objectives of this contract. ATF expressly prohibits employee information being sold or provided to outside entities, vendors, and distributors. As such, the service provider will restrict access to the applications and data maintained in this system to properly authorized individuals performing the work under this contract. Those with access to ATF information should have background investigations and clearances to handle such information. The background investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of ATF's Personnel Security Branch (PSB), Office of Professional Responsibility and Security Operations. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to provide the necessary personnel suitability and security package in a timely manner, through the assigned COTR, to ATF's PSB so that a background investigation can be conducted. Any indication or belief that ATF information has been compromised will immediately be reported to the Chief, Special Operations Division.

<p>&bull; Defining all components of the kit</p>
<p>&bull; Documenting orders for each kit component</p>
<p>&bull; Tracking orders, order receipt, and order issue for each component</p>
<p>&bull; Tracking stock levels by kit component with kit identification on component shortfalls</p>
<p>The capabilities available through the other online product catalogs maintained in this system will function similarly for kitting activities, to include having:</p>
<p>&bull; an unlimited quantity of items that can be built in upon demand, and/or added/deleted as necessary</p>
<p>&bull; its own support documents such as:</p>
<p>o Jpeg or other file type photo images</p>
<p>o Online technical manuals</p>
<p>o Expiration limit documentation on perishables, i.e., medicines</p>
<p>o Life cycle tracking to alert and/or remind the system user of an impending product expiration</p>
<p>o Vendor lead time on product; this could be extended to include updates on available inventory at established intervals</p>
<p>5.2 Reverse logistics. The service provider may negotiate, on behalf of ATF, reverse logistics for items procured, in that ATF may be afforded a credit from a supplier for purchases still in inventory that may have been replaced/superseded by a newer version due to technology advances, recalls, etc. Such an action will only be initiated after receiving ATF's approval. An award to the service provider may be negotiated.</p>
<p>5.3 Reports. As requested by ATF on an as-needed basis, the service provider will be expected to generate select reports based on analyses to facilitate ATF's audit/business management processes.<br /><br />5.0 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE. The ATF Contracting Officer will designate in writing a program office representative to serve as the COTR for this contract. The responsibilities of the COTR appointment will be addressed in a memorandum and provided to the service provider for informational use. In general, the COTR will be responsible for monitoring and assessing contractor performance and deliverables, receiving and accepting the deliverables, and keeping the contracting officer informed of any issues that affect contract performance.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Administrative Services Division provides bottled gas services for the NIST Gaithersburg Campus.  This service includes ordering of in-house gases, ordering of specialty gases, delivery and pick up of bottles to remote buildings, and management, repair and maintenance of the bottles.

NIST seeks information on commercial vendors capable of providing all of the following: 
-Provide all in-house and specialty gases; 
-Provide all maintenance, repair and upgrades to the NIST owned bottles.  It is NISTs intention 
to fully meet and/or exceed the Compressed Gas Association Standards for bottle gases and 
improve the safe handling and use of the bottles.;
-Supply Contractor-owned bottles for specialty gases;
-Manage and operate the use of all these bottles on the NIST campus via a Contractor-provided bottled gas tracking system that will allow NIST to track the current location of  all bottles (NIST-owned and Contractor -owned) that are on the NIST campus or off-site to be 
repaired/service or refilled;
-To improve the NIST Standards for bottle gases.  NIST intends to have each bottle meet set 
performance requirements that will insure a high level of safety for NIST cylinders as well as 
improved quality of the product delivered in the bottle.

After the results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for this requirement, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small business manufacturers are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

In-House Gases
In house gases are pure analytical gases that NIST stocks in a centralized store room on the NIST Gaithersburg Campus.  Below is a chart of these gases and the current number of filled cylinders.  
	 DESCRIPTION 		FILL BALANCE
	Nitrogen S-D 220 Cu. Ft.		80.00
	P-10, Arg-90 Meth-10		12.00
	Forming 95% N2/5% H2		 9.00
	Helium 200 Cu Ft Grade A		40.00
	Oxygen 220 Cu Ft		46.00
	Tech CO2 50 Lbs		19.00
	 Hydrogen 220 Cu Ft		16.00

	Acetylene 225 Cu Ft		52.00
	Air Breathing 220 Cu Ft		15.00
	Argon 220 Cu Ft		50.00	
		TOTAL		355.00

Specialty Gases
Specialty gases are those gases that NIST does not have a high demand to stock for research.  They are considered to be gases that may have a unique mix requirement for a one time specific research application.  These gases must be provided in Contractor-owned bottles that meet the safety requirements below. The required gas will vary by lab specific needs.  The labs provide the specific mixture that meets the need of the researcher.  

Sample specialty gases are:
22% Carbon Dioxide, Balance Nitrogen
49 % Oxygen / Balance Helium 
9 PPM n-DECANE BALANCE NITROGEN
2.0-K  Methane
5 PPM SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE
Ultra High Purity Krypton

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. 

**SPECIAL NOTE:  THIS REQUIREMENT MAY OR MAY NOT USE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) FUNDS AT THE ACTUAL TIME OF THE SOLICITATION AND AWARD.

All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to this notice; however, sources that do not respond shall not be precluded from responding to any subsequent solicitation.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) owns and operates a 20 MW Test Reactor. This reactor is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under the name NBSR (National Bureau of Standards (NBS) Reactor; NBS is the former name of NIST). The purpose of the NBSR is to be a steady state source of neutron radiation that can be used to perform a variety of radiation experiments to support the research programs of the NCNR.
 
Among the principal nuclear safety related components of the NBSR are Safety Shim Rods (SSRs).  The function of the SSRs is to regulate and control the nuclear reaction that takes place in the core of the reactor as supported by fuel rods. The operational part of an SSR is a sheet of cadmium (a neutron absorber) that is captured between two aluminum cylinders in such a way that no cadmium is in contact with the outside world. These cylinders do not have a circular cross-section.  Their cross-section is better described as oval or race-track. During an operational cycle of the NBSR there are always four (4) SSRs present in the reactor core.
 
Cadmium SSRs rods are consumables.  As SSRs perform their function as control rods, the cadmium slowly burns up (which means, during use, the cadmium isotope that performs the control function is slowly replaced by another cadmium isotope that cannot be used to control the reactor).  In practice, this means that the shim safety rods need to be replaced approximately, every four (4) years.

The NCNR has a requirement for 20 SSRs to perform its mission for the next twenty (20) years.

The NCNR is working, through an existing contract, to complete an engineering package, inclusive of shop drawings, tooling drawings, work instructions, and quality control procedures, that, when strictly adhered to in the environment of a qualified manufacturing facility, will result in complete and workable SSRs.  

NIST is seeking qualified manufacturing facilities to satisfy this requirement.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and a statement of work developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that results would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

A qualified manufacturing facility would be:  
1. Able to deliver progress reports on a monthly basis;
2. Able to participate in monthly phone conferences;
3. Able to perform planning and scheduling in accordance with industry practice, such that 
    delivery in accordance with contractual requirements is guaranteed;
4. Has a proven track record of executing engineered work flow without the need for further 
    engineering involvement;
5. Has a Quality Program Plan that meets or exceeds the requirements for ASME NQA-1, ISO 
    9000, DOE Order 414.1A and 10CFR830.122;
6. Has access to Fabrication and Manufacturing capabilities including, but not limited to, 
     the following:
	6.1 Materials Procurement;
	6.2 Machining;
	6.3 Forming;
	6.4 Cleaning;
	6.5 Welding;
	6.6 Heat treating;
	6.7 Safe handling of toxic metals (i.e. cadmium);
	6.8 Packaging.

7. Has access to the Quality Assurance and Quality Control capabilities including, but 
     not limited to, the following:
	7.1 Dimensional Inspection;
	7.2 Weld Inspection;

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to seek information on all sources capable of responding to a potential new solicitation. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.
<p>BACKGROUND: The National Institute on Aging (NIA) is conducting a follow-up study to the clinical trial titled "The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) - Memory in Diabetes (MIND)". The follow-up study will be a two-year effort to follow-up the original ACCORD-MIND subset of patients to acquire a third Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of the brain. ACCORD-MIND MRI is a sub-study in ACCORD, a randomized, multi-center, factorial designed clinical trial in 10,251 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MIND MRI included 620 of these participants, and was conducted at four sites, and was managed through a central coordinating office and four clinical networks. The Coordinating Center includes a central MRI quality control and reading center. The goal of the ACCORD-MIND trial was to address the question as to whether three complimentary treatment strategies could reduce the risk for cognitive decline, or adverse changes in brain structure measured on MRI. The treatment strategies administered as a part of the main ACCORD trial were designed to compare standard vs intensive control glycemia targeted to near-normal levels (target HbA1c &lt; 6), to compare to placebo the effect of fibrates, which increase HDL-cholesterol and lower triglycerides, in the context of good LDL-C control, and of intensive BP control targeting the normal range (SBP&lt; 120 mmHg). Specifically, ACCORD-MIND evaluates intensive glucose, blood pressure and lipid management as means to reduce detrimental changes in the brain structure and function.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: This contract will follow up MIND participants to acquire an additional measure of brain structure, and to expand the outcomes of the study to nursing home placement and to new clinical events that follow or precede measures of the brain. The objective of following up MIND participants is to further delineate how diabetes affects the brain. The aging of the cohort, longer follow-up and an additional MRI allow the study of the longitudinal effects of diabetes-related factors on the brain, and to investigate how these factors, in combination with older age, interact leading to worse outcomes. Specifically: the contract will investigate: 1) What changes and what is the trajectory of change in brain structure? 2) What are the risk factors associated with increased, as well as reduced risk for adverse changes in brain structure or function? 3) Do these changes increase the risk for dementia, nursing home placement or death? 4) How do the brain changes co-vary with the development of other diabetes co-morbidities such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy? and, 5) Do the changes predict prospectively collected data on fasting levels of glucose, A1C levels, and hypoglycemic events?</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor shall have overall responsibility for the coordination of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) activities that are a fundamental part of the ACCORD MIND Follow-Up Study. These activities include: 1) Recruitment of participants who previously participated in the ACCORD MIND sub-study. Recruitment muse be done in concert with the staff at the ACCORD clinics that are following the participants as part of the ACCORD Follow-up Study (NHLBI); 2) Acquisition, quality control, analysis, archiving, and retrieving of scans; 3) Updating and reviewing web-based activities; writing annual reports as required by the funding agency; 4) Deposition of data into a centralized database that houses other data from the ACCORD MIND MRI sub-study; 5) Analysis and collaboration on manuscripts based on this study and the previous ACCORD MIND MRI sub-study; 6) Monitor the progress of MRI field site activities, including: recruitment goals, successful scheduling for MRI appointments, completion of scan protocol, transmission of the scans to the Coordinating Center and adherence of quality control and reporting techniques; training and re-training of MRI staff as needed. Training of MRI technicians for the brain MRI should include the MRI scan protocol, scheduling and screening for participant MRI eligibility; quality control and transmission protocols; 7) Organize and implement training of staff at the local clinic that is following the MIND participants as a part of the larger main trial. Training should include: the purpose of the MRI, the logistics of identifying eligible participants, scheduling and rescheduling of appointments, and the process for addressing other issues that may routinely arise from participant questions or reasons for refusal; 8) Design and implement a Quality Control (QC) procedure for the MRI field sites that is appropriate for the four networks that have previously participated in the ACCORD MIND MRI sub-study; 9) Demonstrate comparability between the acquisition and analysis of MRI scans to the previously acquired and analyzed scans that are part of the ACCORD MIND MRI sub-study. Additionally, the Contractor shall collaborate with the MRI Study Data Coordinating Center (DCC) (MRI CC - Nick Bryan, Univ Pennsylvania) to design and maintain: 1) a web link with the main study; 2) a procedure to identify and track participants eligible for the MRI study; 3) a statistically appropriate method to generate quality control statistics; 4) production of quality control reports and uploading to web-site; 5) statistical analyses for primary publications.</p>
<p>REPORTS AND DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: Monthly Technical Progress Report, Annual Technical Progress Report, and Final Report.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is two (2) years (09/30/10 through 09/29/12).</p>
<p>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS: The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees is being contemplated.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT: Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement to include the following: (1) information regarding the respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and, (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information; (2) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code; and, (4) any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the OPDIV's acquisition requirement.</p>

This project will install 32 new GPS-met stations. Most of these will be at existing Plate Boundary Observatory sites throughout California. Up to nine of the new GPS-met sites will be co-located with the snow-level radars that PSD is building and deploying for the HMT-Legacy Project. The sole source determination is based on the NOAA's requirement for the GPS receivers to be compatible with the exiting Trimble receivers in the Plate Boundary Observatory and with the NOAA GPS-met network at NOAA/GSD. Both GSD and PSD have set up data acquisition systems, signal processing tools, and value-added data products that rely on Trimble satellite receiver technology. Purchasing the NETR8 receivers from Trimble ensures that NOAA will maintain these capabilities and allows NOAA to install new GPS-met sites for the HMT-Legacy project.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought

Requirement

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Tarboro, NC that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 5,624 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 5,113 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for a period of 10 years, cancelable after the second year upon 120 days notice.  The space must be available for occupancy by 09/01/2010.  The delineated area is the entire city limits of Tarboro, including:

NORTH:  East from the intersection of Western Blvd and Northern Blvd to E. Baker St.
EAST:  On a line South from the intersection of E. Northern Blvd. and E. Baker St. to Mutual Blvd.
SOUTH: On a line West along Mutual Blvd. to Western Blvd.
WEST: On a line North from the intersection of Mutual Blvd. and Western Blvd. to W. Northern Blvd.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency down-time.

Please send expressions of interest to:

 Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.
 Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.
 ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced.  Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.
 Date of space availability.
 Method of rentable space measurement.
 Building ownership information.
 Amount of parking available on-site and its cost.  Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking.
 Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.
 List of building services provided.
 The number of adjacent parking spaces provided, if any (approximately 42 total).

The Governments decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.

<DESC>This is not a notice for solicitation. This is only a Request for Information (RFI) that is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information solicited under this RFI. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB).
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Library is seeking a new library management system to replace its existing Integrated Library System (ILS).  The world of scholarly publishing and communication is changing. Many resources can be accessed online in digital format. The USGS Library needs to upgrade its ILS to 1) support the mix of digital and non-digital materials that will be used for research in the future; 2) be able to interact with other enterprise systems;  3) improve the back-office efficiency of the library in managing its physical collections and patron records.   
The Library's current ILS is Horizon provided by SirsiDynix Corporation and it has been in place since 1995. This system serves the USGS Library in four locations:  Reston, Virginia; Denver, Colorado; Flagstaff, Arizona; and Menlo Park, California.  It has the following modules:  Acquisitions, Cataloging, Circulation, Serials, and a public OPAC.  Its database contains 350,000 340,095 bibliographic records,  1.7 million 1,736,593 item records, 623,859 authority records, and 6,209 patron records.
The USGS Library is interested in replacing the current ILS with a system that has the following basic functionalities:
Resource Selection and Acquisition:  Support the trial and/or acquisition of resources in various formats.  Have the ability to obtain or create metadata for decision making, identify suppliers, manage Terms of Acquisitions & Use, manage funds, commit funds, order resources, schedule events, track events, and receive resources.
Entity Description:  Support the processes used to obtain, create, modify, delete or expose metadata for the resources, collections, people, organization, services, events, facilities, finances, relationships, etc.
Resource Delivery: Support processes tracking the request and supply of resources for library users.  Have the ability to initiate and receive the request, identify the user requesting the resource, check and verify the user's credentials, and determine availability and terms of use of the resource requested. Be able to send a message to the user whenever a condition is not met. The resource is supplied if all conditions are met.
Resource Management:  Support the processes  to track the life-cycle of a resource including preservation, curation, evaluation, retention, relocation, duplication, version preference, rights management, binding, repair, reformat, replacement, and withdrawal. Access and descriptive metadata may be normalized and updated in this process according to established rules.
Entity Relationship Management:  Allow the creation, modification and deletion of relationships between any 2 or more entities.  Entities can include resources, people, facilities, organizations, finances, etc.
Customer Relationship Management:  Support the processes to handle customer relationship management (CRM) including a user's initiation for request of service to the fulfillment of that request. 
Reporting:  Has the ability to provide canned or customized statistical reports for the usage of and the work performed in the system.
In addition to the above basic functionalities, the system should also meet the flowing critical requirements:
Flexibility: Support a wide range of resources; accessed by a wide range of customers in a variety of contexts; provides structures for extending and adding new types of resources, customers and contexts. Can be customized to support local classification system, such as USGS Classification Schema.
Service Orientation: Developed using the methods of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and implemented with technologies,  such as Web Services,  to be a modular and open application that ensures the interoperability of library business systems and accommodates a diversity of solutions without the risks posed by single-source providers; can be customized to support local needs. 
Interoperability with Other Applications: Designed to adapt to and integrate with other enterprise systems such as research support, human resources, identity management, fiscal control, repository, content management, search and discovery, OCLC group cataloging, Interlibrary loan, etc.
Security:  Comply with federal security requirement via Certification and Accreditation process(C&A).  Certification is a comprehensive evaluation of the technical and non-technical security features and other safeguards of an IT system and establishes the extent to which a particular design and implementation meets documented security requirements.  Accreditation is the formal declaration by an approving authority that an IT system is compliant with established security requirements and is approved to operate using a prescribed set of safeguards. This decision should be strongly based on the residual risks identified during certification. USGS IT systems are certified and accredited for operation in accordance with DOI and NIST requirements.   (See   NIST SP-800-53 document for all Required Security Controls)	
All venders providing traditional ILS or new type of library management system that meets all or part of the basic functionalities are encouraged to reply.  Vendors providing services to support an open-source application are also encouraged to reply.  Please articulate the specifications and approximate cost information (i.e. order of magnitude, maintenance fee) of your solution, specifically for the following items:
Application functions, modules and architecture;Hardware specification;System initial set up and migration;Required hosting infrastructure:  operating system platform, programming language, networking protocols, etc.Ongoing maintenance and licensing.
Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective for this RFI is information gathering and not development of possible government acquisition of products or services.

<DESC>The Department of Veteran Affairs Supply (Value) Chain Transformation ProgramNotice Type:  Sources SoughtThe proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY (as defined in FAR 15.201(e)), this is not a solicitation. Solicitations are not available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates and manages procurement systems responsible for the procurement of approximately $34 billion in goods and services per year. Currently the VA's enterprise information systems and process are outdated and are not able to efficiently manage current procurement demand. The VA is therefore requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of attracting healthcare supply chain management contractors to provide integrated enterprise supply (value) chain management support services to the VA. These services will support and increase the efficiency of current VA enterprise supply chain management systems. The VA requires procurement information systems that provide purchasing information in near real time. These data systems should be capable of capturing and displaying the analytics required for informed decision making at key VA organization levels. Key VA organization levels include (but are not limited to VA Medical Centers (VAMC), Veteran Integrated Services Networks (VISN), Regional/National Acquisition Centers, VA Health Administration (VHA) and the VA Central Office (VACO).The contractor would conduct a VA Enterprise Supply (Value) Chain Assessment for the purposes of identification and documentation of performance improvements and increased procurement system effectiveness. The assessment will include a recommendation for the professional services, information systems and any associated tools required to support VA Enterprise purchasing management. The contractor would focus its evaluation on the VHA procurement program for Medical Surgical and Prosthetics Equipment. Upon VA approval of the assessment the contractor may be tasked to execute the recommendation. If a materiel solution is implemented the contractor may be tasked to provide the professional services required to operate the materiel solution in support of VA procurement staff. The VA Enterprise Supply (Value) Chain Assessment is important so that all areas of potential non-compliance are identified, documented, and priced. The contractors' implementation methodology will provide best industry practices for the following services:(a) A recommendation for the most efficient organization and methodology for the operation of the VA Medical Surgical products and Prosthetics devices supply chains.	(b) A recommendation for world class transformation methodologies, including but not limited to, the equipment, software, firmware and hardware required to facilitate VA enterprise supply chain management.	(c) A recommendation for the Professional enterprise supply chain management "back office" support.	(d) A recommendation for providing data analytics of VA enterprise procurement data.	(e) A recommendation for the methodology for conducting product and data standardization.	(f) A recommendation for establishing, updating and optimize the VA's E-Catalog.	To execute the above services, the contractor would perform the following activities:(a) The contractor would review current VA Policy and Handbooks concerning the procurement of Medical Surgical and Prosthetics Commodities. Review VHA Handbooks 1173.1 through 1173.15 and 1173.17 (Prosthetics and Sensory Aid Service policy), VHA directives 1660.1 and 1660.3), VA Directive 7002 (Logistics Management Policy) and VA Directive 1663 (Health Care Resources Contracting - Buying Title 38 U.S.C. 8153). The contractor would develop a recommendation for improved Enterprise procurement business rules that could be programmed into the VA procurement system software that will provide improved procurement compliance.	(b) The contractor would review VA enterprise compliance with VHA Directive 2006-029 ensuring accurate prosthetics data entry throughout the enterprise for prosthetics orders into the National Prosthetics Patient Database (NPPD), i.e. surgical implants, audiology, etc.; ensuring appropriate use of prosthetics cost centers and budget object codes; and managing inventory through the Prosthetics Inventory Package (PIP) to maximize appropriate resource utilization. (See note at end of #5.).	(c) The contractor would review the current VA medical surgical and prosthetics commodities data identification standards, including the National Item File. The contractor would recommend a process for data standardization to enhance the appropriate capture, use and dissemination of procurement data.(d) The contractor would review current process for the prosthetics organizational functions within the VISN including use of mandatory contracts and contract development. The contractor would develop a recommendation for improved procurement system rules that could be programmed into the VA procurement systems software that will provide improved procurement compliance including providing near real time data capture to provide a basis for data analytics.(e) The contractor would review VA Prosthetics and Orthotic Laboratory/Services including inventory, workload capture, and relationships with other clinical services, determination of consistent compliance with forwarding all contractor quotes to a certified Prosthetist/Orthotist for review to ensure accurate invoicing. The contractor would develop a recommendation for improved business rules that will provide for improved compliance including providing near real time data capture to provide a basis for data analytics. The contractor would also develop and provide recommendations for the development of process metrics and compliance management techniques.(f) The contractor would review the current process for enterprise supply chain management and develop a recommendation for the professional services and equipment (if any) required to establish a centralized data warehouse that will provide the data required to perform procurement data analysis at the VA Medical Center, Veteran Integrated Service network (VISN), region, VA Administration and Central Office levels. The Data Warehouse must capture information from current VA databases and provide a platform for data analytics. The contractor would create enterprise procurement dashboards that can be displayed at procurement analysts' work stations.(g) The contractor would review the current VA E-Catalog, and develop a recommendation for update, upgrade and methods for automated maintenance and utilization of a new VA E-Catalog capability.(h) The contractor would review VA processes for clinical product standardization. The contractor shall recommend policy and practice updates that can be integrated into the enterprise supply chain to introduce greater efficiency into both the product standardization process and the procurement process for those systems.(i) The contractor would review competency assessments, training, and education, for essential areas such as procurement, inventory management, consult management, and other compliance areas for enterprise procurement and clinical staff.(j) The contractor would review VISN-wide training plans and evaluate plan effectiveness, its effectiveness and oversight.As stated above, The VA may also request the contractor to implement all approved recommendations resulting from their initial review and assessment of current VA operations and practices. Upon successful implementation the VA may also request that the contractor support the operation of the new systems to support VA enterprise procurement operations. It is anticipated that only contractors with current commercially available or adaptable systems will be eligible for this effort. Contractor recommendations based on the use of proprietary equipment, systems and processes shall be identified as such.The VA is in the process of planning a Pre-solicitation conference in Crystal City, Virginia April 6 -7, 2010. The conference will discuss the VA's requirement for these services. The conference will give contractors the opportunity to present their latest approaches to Enterprise Healthcare Supply (Value) Chain Management. More details about the Pre-solicitation conference will be posted via an amendment to this RFI as they become available.Submit expressions of interest electronically in Microsoft Word format (no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, Times New Roman, 12 point font minimum) to include documentation of corporate capabilities in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary expertise and experience in analysis, evaluation and implementation which would be utilized to improve the VA Enterprise Supply (Value) Chain Management. In addition, submit any lessons learned and best commercial practices that would be utilized for the VA Enterprise Supply (Value) Chain Management requirement.Since this is a Sources Sought Announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants. This announcement is not a solicitation and does not bind the Government to award any contract. No solicitations exist at this time. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.

No solicitation document is available. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The Discovery, Early Detection, Evaluation, Treatment and Prevention in Cancer Research at Penn State require two complete used modular High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Systems for continued cancer research by the Organic Synthesis Core.<BR><BR>The complete HPLC system is comprised of modular elements with the following salient characteristics:<BR><BR>Pump System<BR><BR>	Programmable Flow Rate 0.00 to 5.00mL/min, in 0.01-mL/min increments<BR>	Flow Accuracy 2% of setting at 0.1mL/min using degassed methanol at 1000  2000 psi backpressure<BR>	Maximum Operating Pressure 6000 psi<BR>	Software Controlled high and low pressure limits<BR><BR>Autosampler<BR><BR>	Audible Noise Level (less than) 65dBA<BR>	Working Temperature 10 to 40C (indoor use only)<BR>	Max Weight that it can support on top 143lbs.<BR>	Power Requirements 95 to 240 Volt AC 10%<BR>	Sample Capacity 2 microliter trays<BR>	Maximum plate/vial height: 4.7 cm<BR>	Dispenser Syringe 500L standard<BR>	Missing Vial Detection<BR><BR>UV/Visible Detector<BR><BR>	Maximizes energy throughput<BR>	Eliminates refractive index effects<BR>	Maintains good peak shape<BR><BR>Column Heater<BR><BR>	Set Point Temperature Range 20 C to 60 C<BR>	Temperature Accuracy +/- 0.8 C<BR>	Temperature Precision +/- 0.25 C<BR>	Maximum Operating Pressure 6000psi with programmable limits<BR><BR>Integral Vac Degas<BR><BR>	Programmable Flow Rate 0.00 to 22.5 mL/min in 0.01-mL/min increments<BR>	Maximum Operating Pressure 5000psi<BR><BR>Manual Injector<BR><BR>Photodiode Array (PDA) Detector<BR><BR>	Differentiate  spectra between closely related compounds<BR><BR>Windows Based PC Control<BR><BR>	Preinstalled pump system control software<BR>	Mouse <BR>	Keyboard<BR>	DVD R/W drive<BR>	Four Year Warranty<BR><BR>LCD Monitor<BR><BR>Chromatographic System Software<BR><BR>HPLC System Installation<BR><BR>	Set up and Performance Testing<BR>	Product Training<BR>	1 Year System Warranty<BR>	Remote Assistance Software<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Modular High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Systems are made up of multiple components some of which are proprietary to the manufacturers.  The included software for the Waters HPLC system is a proprietary system that is preinstalled for use with Waters brand PHOC components.  The UV/Visible Detector has a patented cell reader that provides greater sensitivity for performance analysis.  The proposed purchase for the used Waters HPLC system is also covered by the manufacturer warranty.

While there are two complete HPLC systems available on the market that fit the salient characteristics only one can meet the cost requirements. The complete HPLC system manufactured and sold by Waters best meets the requirements of the principal investigators. <BR><BR>4.

A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  None<BR><BR><BR>6.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be sent to the designated BPA contract holder.  This acquisition falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210.  Below is a general description of the services required.
Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, the Montana BLM has been tasked with ensuring positional mapping accuracy of records and boundaries in support of renewable energy development. The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey information and GPS positions to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System in support of parcel based recordation, as well as analysis and display of geographic information.  This information known as the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), has been assembled in a series of ascii flat files which is converted to a GIS format to support stakeholders and customers of the information. 
The geographic location of the identified renewable energy townships, is primarily in areas having the potential for renewable energy in support of the current administrations energy priorities and in the transmission of that energy.  
This work will include the research of survey information for each corner in preparation for recovering survey corners and measuring their positions with survey grade GPS receivers.  Research may be conducted on federal, state, or private/local government survey records.   Work shall include research that is needed to efficiently locate, record information, and measure the location of survey corners or boundary locations.  Only one coordinate pair in North American Datum 1983 (NAD 83), is needed for all rectangular or non-rectangular corners.  The accepted GPS measurements will be used for control in the GCDB.   Digital photographs of found monumentation as well as other evidence such as bearing trees etc. shall be collected.  This work shall be performed on approximately 1000 corner positions in 147 townships.    
Remonumentation of government corner positions is not allowed under this award.  Monuments shall be described as found and not rehabilitated.  The contractor will not use accessories to establish a corner position, but accessories may be used to verify that a monument is in the position of record.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Bureau of Land Management, National Operations Center (NOC), intends to award a call/task order against the competitively awarded Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for GCDB and Land Records Services to procure services for Control Document Index (CDI) aperture cards in Montana.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be sent to the designated BPA contract holder.  This acquisition falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210.  Below is a general description of the services required. The BLM maintains thousands of historic vital records of public land ownership in Montana. These records contain copies of original documents that have been microfilmed and are currently stored as a collection of microfilm aperture cards referred to as the Control Document Index (CDI). The BLM, Montana State Office has only one set of these aging microfilm aperture cards that are cumbersome to research and are not backed up in a digital format. The cards contain images of records that date back to the mid-1800s and include copies of patents and deeds that convey title of public lands to and from the United States. 
The purpose of this project is to scan up to 1,416,660 land status records from these micro-graphic copies of legal documents mounted on aperture cards. These records are within the states of Montana and the Dakotas and include townships identified as having existing renewable energy applications/authorizations or high renewable energy potential.  This project will enable the BLM to more efficiently evaluate right of way applications and permits for renewable energy or other projects in a more efficient and timely manner; thereby saving the public and the BLM time in the land use application process.  This will also improve the automation and quality assurance of BLMs current land status information.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE - THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.

Background -- In March of 2009, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was authorized by Congress to set up a therapeutics development program for rare and neglected diseases hereafter named the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases program (TRND), which would also develop innovative research processes for preclinical drug development.  For the purposes of TRND, rare diseases are defined according to the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, and as amended in 1984, 1985, and 1988, affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States; neglected diseases are defined according to the World Health Organization, being primarily tropical infectious diseases that are highly prevalent in the developing world.  The NIH estimates that more than 6,800 rare diseases afflict more than 25 million Americans.  However, effective pharmacologic treatments exist for only about 200 of these illnesses.   The new TRND Program operates scientifically and administratively through the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) with oversight by the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR).  To jump-start TRND, NIH is considering initiating projects with promising drug candidates that are stalled in development for which there are clinical data, or for which a data package could be generated and compiled into an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission within one year of transfer of the project to TRND.  Responses to this RFI will be used to formulate a Request for Proposal (RFP) to acquire drug programs, expected to be published in May, 2010 with a proposal submission deadline in June, 2010.  The RFP would initiate a process for TRND to purchase by contract award by September 30, 2010, the most promising compounds for their development by TRND at NIHs expense.   Alternatively, the information received through this RFI may be used to negotiate Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) with program owners who wish to have their candidate compounds developed by TRND but who are unwilling or unable to sell the Programs in their entirety to NIH.   

Description -- The new NIH Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases program (TRND), located in Bethesda, Maryland, is creating an Research and Development (R&D) infrastructure to develop small molecule lead compounds for a broad range of rare and neglected diseases.  To jump-start the activities of this new program, the NIH wishes to acquire full ownership of a small number of rare or neglected disease drug discovery candidate compounds, intellectual property, associated analogs and know-how (Programs), and to advance them at its own cost through to the human clinical trials proof-of-concept stage.  An R&D portfolio strategy is being developed, and focus areas are being defined.

The purpose of this RFI is to identify what Programs may be available from biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, nonprofit organization, universities, or other organizations, and to notify the research community that TRND intends to acquire and develop these types of drug programs.

NIH is particularly interested in learning what small molecule drug discovery programs for rare and neglected diseases are either stalled or are at risk of being stalled, and characteristics of those programs that might make them candidates for an accelerated drug development program such as TRND.   Relevant candidate drug projects may be in various stages, from robust research probe to Phase I clinical trials.   At a minimum, compounds must have drug-like properties using biopharmaceutical industry standards, and data showing reproducible activity, structure activity relationship (SAR), and efficacy in a variety of cellular and/or animal model systems; demonstration of favorable in vitro and/or in vivo ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) properties is required for later stage compounds.  Compounds beyond the research probe stage should generally be protected by U.S. or world-wide patents.  The compounds may be repurposed drug candidates meaning that they have been developed for a common disease indication, but during the development process, they were also found to show promise for a rare or neglected disease indication. The NIH is particularly interested in learning about drug candidates that meet biotechnology or pharmaceutical company drug development program entry criteria, but are stalled for financial or strategic reasons.  NIH is requesting information on the existence of compounds at these stages of development, in the following order of priority:
1.  Open US IND application with existing human data;
2.  Open IND, but no human data;
3.  IND-enabling data exist but the IND has not yet been written or submitted to the Food and
     Drug Administration (FDA);
4.  A drug candidate compound in late stage pre-clinical development and back-up compounds 
     for a  specific drug target that would require no more than 6 to 12 months of further pre-
     clinical profiling to be  ready for an IND enabling toxicology and ADMET program; and
5.  A research probe compound.

Information Requested  -- The NIH solicits the following information in summary form:
1.  Rare or neglected disease(s) for which the compound is being developed
2.  Compound name
     a.  Chemical structure of the compound
     b.  Company designation
     c.  Brand name, if any
3.  A summary of the status of the program
4.  The owner of the intellectual property (IP) associated with the compounds and research 
     data
5.  A summary of the US and international patents issued or patent applications, and their
     status
6.  Any known blocking IP that would prevent transferring the compound to a third party for
     development
7.  Why the compound is stalled or at risk of being stalled in development
8.  Details on the most advanced stage of development
9.  If applicable, whether good manufacturing practice (GMP) compound is available for
     clinical trials
10.  Pre-clinical data
       a.  Summary data of biological activity against the target in vitro in human cells (potency, 
            efficacy, and SAR data)
      b.   Summary data of biological activity against the target in vivo in animal models (potency, 
            efficacy, and SAR data)
      c.  Summary data from drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics profiling
            i.   In vitro
            ii.  In vivo small and/or large animal
      d.  Summary data from drug substance profiling and pharmacologic development 
           processes
      e.  Summary data from toxicology profiling
           i.   In vitro 
           ii.  In vivo small and/or large animal
11.  Clinical data
       a.   Summary human safety
       b.   Summary human dosing data
       c.   Summary  human tolerability
       d.   Summary human proof of concept (POC) data
             i.   Biomarkers 
             ii.  Surrogate endpoint(s)
             iii. Clinically meaningful outcome measures
12.  How many compounds in the same chemical series exist 
13.  Mechanism of action of the drug candidate
14.  Information on the:
       a.  Pharmacophore of the compound
       b.  3-D structure of the drug target (with or without the compound bound)

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6, Other That Full and Open Competition, FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 2 intends to modify Contract No. EP-W-04-055 with AECOM Technical Services, Inc., for continuation of existing environmental cleanup services and emergency environmental cleanup response services in support of Region 2's emergency and rapid response program at sites of release or threatened release of hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA); the Robert T. Stafford Natural Disaster Act and pursuant to the Federal Response Plan. These services cover sites in New York, and New Jersey.
<p>The planned contract action represents a six-month "new work" extension of the contract, effective March 27, 2010 through September 26, 2010. The modification is necessary in order to ensure continuity of critical environmental cleanups services at existing sites and to have the ability to respond to an emergency environmental cleanup within 6 hours of receiving an emergency response notification. Award of the contracts resulting from solicitation PR-R2-08-10085 has been delayed, which has necessitated that the above existing contract be extended until these awards can be made. Region 2's requirements to be covered by this extension include any actions required to mitigate or eliminate any hazard or damage to the environment resulting from: a release or threat of release of oil, petroleum products, hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants into the environment; the threat of fire and explosion and incidents involving terrorist acts, weapons of mass destruction and nuclear, biological or chemical incidents; or natural or man-made disasters. In addition to emergency environmental responses, should they arise; the work to be extended represents 13 existing task orders under Contract EP-W-04-055. These on-going environmental cleanup services require uninterrupted support in order to address and reduce immediate risks to human health and the environment. It is in the best interest of the Government to extend the existing contract pending award of the follow-on contracts, which are currently under evaluation.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written inquiries or comments regarding this announcement may be emailed to Karen Giacobbe at giacobbe.karen@epa.gov.</p>

Due to the unique and highly specialized nature of the United States Census Bureau's Economic Programs statistical work, many activities depend on one-of-a-kind data processing systems designed and built by the Census Bureaus IT professionals.  The development of these systems also relies on statistical and program know-how contributed by the agencys methodologists and subject matter experts, who identify the requirements that processing systems must satisfy.  Within the Economic Programs Directorate, the Economic Planning and Coordination Division (EPCD) has primary responsibility for developing requirements for software systems that support the economic census and business surveys.  The Division acknowledges the importance of complete, correct, unambiguous, consistent, prioritized, and testable requirements in constructing software systems that meet these programs business needs, and it recognizes opportunities to improve its work in this area by introducing industry standards and best practices. 

To achieve this objective, the division requires advice and assistance from software engineering experts who have broad experience in effective and up-to-date methods for requirements development.  
To enhance execution of these efforts, the Census Bureau has an immediate need for independent and objective advice and support in the areas of systems redesign and software process improvement from a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  The Census Bureau has identified The MITRE Corporation (MITRE), an operator of three FFRDCs, as the appropriate source for the needed support.  The Census Bureau has determined that this effort is within the scope of MITREs Internal Revenue Service (IRS) FFRDC contract and fully aligned with the FFRDCs core competencies and its mission to assist federal agencies with modernizing information systems and associated business processes.
The Mitre Corporation is currently providing data processing system redesign services under the U.S Census Bureau's Task Order # YA1323-09-NC-0854.

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance, W91278-08-C-0013<br><br>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification using Recovery Act funding to contract number W91278-08-C-0013, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Allatoona Lake Project, Cartersville, Georgia, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815 Hennessey, OK. Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted, to perform paving and site work around the following gatehouses: McKaskey Creek, Victoria, and Blockhouse. This work is necessary due to the fact that areas adjacent to the gatehouses and attendant sites were disturbed during construction.  In order to make the areas safe and accessible to the public, this work is essential.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>This existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1) Time constraints due to scheduled park openings.  2) The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in the Allatoona recreation area. 3) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance, and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and can be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation. 4) This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed aversely impacting public access to camping and recreation facilities during the busiest season of the year.<BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet these specified limited requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to award an additional year to the sole source contract, M67854-09-C-4843, with Decision Systems Applications, Inc. (DSAI) to provide technical services to maintain and sustain the current manpower models used by Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA) and Total Force Structure Division (TFSD) for all phases of the active and reserve Marine Corps manpower staffing, planning, assigning, mobilizing, and classifying process.  The following are the Models that require continued support (* -- Contains Proprietary Sub-Routines):
a.  Enlisted Assignment Model (EAM)*b.  Enlisted Staffing Goal Model (ESGM)*c.  Officer Staffing Goal Model (OSGM)*d.  Officer Planning Utility System (OPUS)* e.  Recruit Distribution Model (RDM)*f.  Marine Equity Model (MEM)g.  Target Force Projection Model (TFPM)h.  Reserve Enlisted Planning System (REPS)i.  Reserve Staffing Model (RSM)*j.  Officer Mobilization Model (OMM)*k.  Table of Manpower Requirements (T/MR)l.  Manning Level Process (MLP)m.  Troop List (TL)
DSAI, the original developer of all but one of the Models and the owner of proprietary code for seven of the Models, has been providing the primary support. The estimated value of the 12-month effort is $705,000.00.  Due to the complex nature of the models used by M&RA and TFSD, and their mission-essential importance to the Marine Corps, the maintenance and user assistance require capabilities beyond the technical resources and personnel assets of the Marine Corps.  Specifically, the services require the contractor to have expert knowledge of the Manpower Models to assist all model managers with operation, maintenance, training, system enhancements, and documentation updates.  The current Total Force Manpower Models Reengineering Effort has been awarded and is scheduled to deploy in September 2010.
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR QUOTES.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-98-H-5013-0054. <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete.

Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents.

Technical capability of offeror to meet the Government requirement; (ii) past performance; (iii) price/cost (see FAR 15.304)<BR><BR>1. Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important when compared to price. <BR><BR>b. Options- The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<BR><BR>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

All proposals will be evaluated by a team of Government employees using  in accordance with the process identified below, conducted as follows: <BR><BR>i. Factors to be Evaluated: <BR><BR>1. Factor 1 Technical Approach<BR><BR>2. Factor 2 Past Performance<BR><BR>3. Factor 3 Price <BR><BR>ii. The relative order of importance of the evaluation factors is as follows: Technical Approach is more important than Past Performance. The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than the Price factor. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR><BR>iii. Phase I - The non-price factors will be evaluated to support best-value trade-off process for the two non-price factors. The non-price factors will be assigned an adjective rating and proposals with an adjective rating of acceptable or be will no be considered for award. The following adjective ratings will be assigned to the offerors technical and past performance portion of the proposal: <BR><BR><BR>1. Excellent -The technical proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes numerous advantageous characteristics of substance, and essentially no disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the prototype provides strengths which are supported in the written technical proposal. The technical factors are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their past performance record.<BR><BR>2. Good - The technical proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. Past performance indicates little doubt that the offeror perform the required effort. <BR><BR>3. Acceptable- The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their past performance record.<BR><BR>4. Marginal - The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are not likely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. Significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.<BR><BR>5. Unacceptable - The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has numerous disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are far outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages will not result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate an understanding of the requirement. It is extremely doubtful that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record<BR><BR>iv. The Government will evaluate the Price factor of the proposals. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness. Each proposals price factor will be considered in relation to its non-price factors. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR><BR><BR>9.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION, A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 for full and open competition.  

The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for the tasks identified below: 


Services and Prices/Costs

Labor/Cost Category	Rate	U/I	Quantity	Total Price
				
				
				

Background

The Office of Biostatistics needs a biomedical statistician to review routine submissions but also complex submissions that require a high level of statistical expertise and experience.  There are several current areas of critical importance to the Division that require significant statistical expertise.  Two of the most important areas are adaptive clinical trial designs and the assessment of cardiovascular (CV) risk in drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Statement of Work

Tasks

The Contractor shall write statistical reviews and evaluations of clinical data contained in New Drug Applications (NDAs), Investigational New Drug (IND) submissions, and related documents.  Data to be reviewed are those submitted from drug sponsors primarily to the Division of Metabolic and Endocrine Products (DMEP) within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at FDA. 

The Contractor will define and develop new formulas, tests, procedures and refine existing procedures as necessary to evaluate new, novel or complex problems. 

Responsibilities include attending and participating in internal meetings with FDA staff and industry meetings with drug sponsors to discuss their drug development programs.  To enhance interaction between the Contractor, FDA staff and industry, it is required that attendance at both internal and industry meetings be on-site (FDA headquarters at White Oak, Maryland) and not off-site via telecom.  It is estimated there will be two to three such meetings per week.

The Contractor shall study the statistical literature to maintain proficiency in statistical expertise with particular attention to statistical methods related to adaptive clinical trial designs, non-inferiority designs and trial designs for the assessment of CV risk in drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

The Contractor shall keep the Project Officer informed of progress on IND and NDA written reviews.

Knowledge/Skills

The Contractor shall have extensive knowledge of statistical theory and methods as applied to adaptive clinical trial designs, non-inferiority designs and clinical trials for the assessment of CV risk.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Programs for Certain Commercial Items (10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 2305 and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) and 253a and 253b), FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355)), and FAR Subpart 37.4, Nonpersonal Health Care Services (10 U.S.C. 2304 and 41 U.S.C. 253). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a fixed-price commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ) 10-10-025-REL. This solicitation is restricted to 100% Small Business concerns. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 621111 and the small business size standard is $10.0 million. PRICE SCHEDULE: BASE YEAR: 24 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; OPTION YEAR ONE: 24 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; OPTION YEAR TWO: 24 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; OPTION YEAR THREE: 24 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; OPTION YEAR FOUR: 24 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; GRAND TOTAL: $_________________________. STATEMENT OF WORK: The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire Orthopedic Services at the Wind River Service Unit, PHS Indian Health Centers, Arapahoe and Fort Washakie, Wyoming. The Contractor shall provide one &frac12; day clinic per month at each location. The Contractor shall visit the Fort Washakie Health Center, Fort Washakie, Wyoming, one day every month between the hours of 12:45 pm and 4:45 pm and the Arapahoe Health Center, Arapahoe, Wyoming one day every month between the hours of 12:45 pm and 4:45 pm. This procurement is a nonpersonal health care service contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the Contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The Contractor shall indemnify the Government for any liability producing acts or omissions by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned. The Contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. MAJOR DUTIES: The Contractor shall provide on-site services for an orthopedic clinic to outpatients scheduled by the Government physician/providers at the Wind River Service Unit. The Contractor shall visit the Fort Washakie Health Center, Fort Washakie, Wyoming, one day every month between the hours of 12:45 pm and 4:45 pm and the Arapahoe Health Center, Arapahoe, Wyoming one day every month between the hours of 12:45 pm and 4:45 pm. During each clinic the Contractor will see up to 28 patients scheduled by the staff of the Fort Washakie Health Center or Arapahoe Health Center. The Contractor shall take a history and perform an appropriate examination. The findings shall be correlated with the laboratory and x-ray findings. The Contractor shall make a verbal report to a Government physician and shall further make a written consultation on the patient's Electronic Health Record. The written consultation shall include the findings, impression, and recommendations about the management. The Government will provide space, nursing assistance, laboratory services, x-ray services, and pharmacy services. Any rescheduling of clinic days or times shall involve consultation with the Contractor by the Government, but shall be at the convenience of the Government. Notification of change must be given at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of change. The Contractor shall be available for consultation by telephone and shall give recommendations to the Government physicians about management of patients seen between clinics. Physician fees for inpatient or outpatient office visits at another facility will be paid at Medicare rate or lower. The Contractor shall accept transfer for patients to his care at his private office or at a local contract hospital by formal written referral from a Government physician. In the event that an emergency admission of an eligible person occurs in a local contract hospital, and that the Contractor is responsible for the care of the patient, the preferred procedure is telephone notification and request for the authorization by an IHS physician. Such a request may be made after the admission by calling the IHS physician on call or the Chief Executive Officer. In such an emergency admission, failure to notify the Wind River Service Unit within 72 hours removes the obligation of the Indian Health Service to participate in the responsibility for payment. While the primary responsibility for notification is with the patient or the patient's family, notification by the Contractor or the hospital may often avert difficulties. Referral from one hospital to another requires the prior approval by an IHS physician. Initial oral permission is followed by written authorization by the IHS physician. Laboratory and other diagnostic tests including x-ray examinations shall be made in one of the Indian Health Service Centers whenever possible.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Programs for Certain Commercial Items (10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 2305 and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) and 253a and 253b), FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355)), and FAR Subpart 37.4, Nonpersonal Health Care Services (10 U.S.C. 2304 and 41 U.S.C. 253). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a fixed-price commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ) 10-10-028-REL. The solicitation is restricted to 100% Small Business concerns. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 621111 and the small business size standard is $10.0 million. PRICE SCHEDULE - NEPHROLOGY SERVICES: BASE YEAR: 12 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; OPTION YEAR ONE: 12 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; OPTION YEAR TWO: 12 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; OPTION YEAR THREE: 12 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; OPTION YEAR FOUR: 12 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; GRAND TOTAL: $_________________________. STATEMENT OF WORK: The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire Nephrology Services at the Wind River Service Unit, PHS Indian Health Centers, Arapahoe and Fort Washakie, Wyoming. The Contractor shall visit the Wind River Service Unit one day every month, &frac12; day per clinic. Clinics will be scheduled between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:45 pm at the Arapahoe Health Center and between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:45 pm at the Fort Washakie Health Center. This procurement is a nonpersonal health care service contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the Contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The Contractor shall indemnify the Government for any liability producing acts or omissions by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned. The Contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. MAJOR DUTIES: The Contractor shall provide on-site services for a nephrology clinic. The Nephrology clinic shall be held one day per month at both clinics. During each clinic the Contractor will see up to 20 patients scheduled by the staff of the Fort Washakie Health Center or Arapahoe Health Center. The Contractor shall visit the Wind River Service Unit one day every month, &frac12; day per clinic. Clinics will be scheduled between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:45 pm at the Arapahoe Health Center and between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:45 pm at the Fort Washakie Health Center. The contractor shall take a history and perform an appropriate examination. The findings shall be correlated with the laboratory and x-ray findings. The Contractor shall make a verbal report to a Government physician and shall further make a written consultation on the patient's Electronic Health Record. The written consultation shall include the findings, impression, and recommendations about the management. The Government will provide space, nursing assistance, laboratory services, x-ray services, and pharmacy services. Any rescheduling of clinic days or times shall involve consultation with the Contractor by the Government, but shall be at the convenience of the Government. Notification of change must be given at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of change. The Contractor shall be available for consultation by telephone and shall give recommendations to the Government physicians about management of patients seen between clinics. The Contractor shall accept transfer for patients to his care at his private office or at a local contact hospital by formal written referral from a Government physician. Physician fees for inpatients or outpatient office visits at another facility will be paid at Medicare rate or lower. In the event that an emergency admission of an eligible person occurs in a local contract hospital, and that the Contractor is responsible for the care of the patient, the preferred procedure is telephone notification and request for the authorization by an IHS physician. Such a request may be made after the admission by calling the IHS physician on call or the Chief Executive Officer. In such an emergency admission, failure to notify the Wind River Service Unit within 72 hours removes the obligation of the Indian Health Service to participate in the responsibility for payment. While the primary responsibility for notification is with the patient or the patient's family, notification by the Contractor or the hospital may often avert difficulties. Referral from one hospital to another requires the prior approval by an IHS physician. Initial oral permission is followed by written authorization by the IHS Physician. Laboratory and other diagnostic tests including x-ray examinations shall be made in one of the Indian Health Service Centers whenever possible. The Contractor will order these tests elsewhere when they are not available at the Indian Health Centers or when the patient is an inpatient at another facility under the care of the Contractor. Authorization shall be obtained from the referring IHS physician before tests are scheduled. It shall be required that the Contractor's private office and the hospital the Contractor utilizes for inpatient procedures be no farther than 60 minutes driving time from Fort Washakie, Wyoming or Arapahoe, Wyoming under normal driving conditions at posted speed limits in a private vehicle. The Contractor will be required to abide by all the rules and regulations that govern the Privacy Act, the Indian Health Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services. All new employees are required to take HIPAA training within a few days after receiving their award letter, notice-to-proceed, access and annually thereafter. All new contractors will be required to write notes, orders (lab, x-ray, and pharmacy) and CHS referrals in the Electronic Health Record. Training will be scheduled during specialty clinic hours. The primary agent/official responsible for supervising this procurement in a project officer capacity and who will be verifying that all supplies and/or services have been received and delivered will be JoLynn Davis, R.N., D.O.N., Clinical Nursing, Wind River Service Unit. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The performance of this contract shall be from May 1, 2010 through April 30, 2011, with four 12-month options. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: The IHS shall provide all necessary equipment and supplies. The Wind River Service Unit will be responsible for getting the Contractor access and clearance to all computer services necessary to carry out his/her duties. COMPUTER SECURITY: All Federal agencies are required by the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) to complete a course in Computer Security Awareness Training (CSAT). Within HHS, there is a requirement for this training to be completed annually by all employees including all contractors, volunteers, students, summer externs, etcetera. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation; therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer. PROJECT OFFICER: The project officer shall be responsible for: (1) Monitoring the Contractors technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending technical changes; (2) Interpreting the Statement of Work; (3) Technical evaluation as required; (4) Technical inspections and acceptance; and (5) Assisting the Contractor in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance of this contract.

The Contractor shall visit the Fort Washakie Health Center, Fort Washakie, Wyoming, two days per month between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:45 pm and the Arapahoe Health Center, Arapahoe, Wyoming two days per month between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:45 pm. During each clinic the Contractor will see up to 20 patients scheduled by the staff of the Fort Washakie Health Center or Arapahoe Health Centers. The Contractor shall take a history and perform an appropriate examination. The findings shall be correlated with the laboratory and x-ray findings. The Contractor shall make a verbal report to a Government physician and shall further make a written consultation on the patient's Electronic Health Record. The written consultation shall include the findings, impression, and recommendations about the management. The Government will provide space, nursing assistance, laboratory services, x-ray services, and pharmacy services. Any rescheduling of clinic days or times shall involve consultation with the Contractor by the Government, but shall be at the convenience of the Government. Notification of change must be given at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of change. The Contractor shall be available for consultation by telephone and shall give recommendations to the Government physicians about management of patients seen between clinics. Physician fees for inpatient or outpatient office visits at another facility will be paid at Medicare rate or lower. The Contractor shall accept transfer for patients to his care at his private office or at a local contract hospital by formal written referral from a Government physician. In the event that an emergency admission of an eligible person occurs in a local contract hospital, and that the Contractor is responsible for the care of the patient, the preferred procedure is telephone notification and request for the authorization by an IHS physician. Such a request may be made after the admission by calling the IHS physician on call or the Chief Executive Officer. In such an emergency admission, failure to notify the Wind River Service Unit within 72 hours removes the obligation of the Indian Health Service to participate in the responsibility for payment. While the primary responsibility for notification is with the patient or the patient's family, notification by the Contractor or the hospital may often avert difficulties. Referral from one hospital to another requires the prior approval by an IHS physician. Initial oral permission is followed by written authorization by the IHS Physician. Laboratory and other diagnostic tests including x-ray examinations shall be made in one of the Indian Health Service Centers whenever possible. The Contractor will order these tests elsewhere when they are not available at the Indian Health Centers or when the patient is an inpatient at another facility under the care of the Contractor. Authorization shall be obtained from the referring IHS physician before tests are scheduled. It shall be required that the Contractor's private office and the hospital the Contractor utilizes for inpatient procedures be no farther than 60 minutes driving time from Fort Washakie, Wyoming or Arapahoe, Wyoming under normal driving conditions at posted speed limits in a private vehicle. The Contractor will be required to abide by all the rules and regulations that govern the Privacy Act, the Indian Health Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services. All new employees are required to take HIPAA training within a few days after receiving their award letter, notice-to-proceed, access and annually thereafter. All new contractors will be required to write notes, orders (lab, x-ray, and pharmacy) and CHS referrals in the Electronic Health Record. Training will be scheduled during specialty clinic hours. The primary agent/official responsible for supervising this procurement in a project officer capacity and who will be verifying that all supplies and/or services have been received and delivered will be JoLynn Davis, R.N., D.O.N., Clinical Nursing, Wind River Service Unit. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The performance of this contract shall be from May 1, 2010 through April 30, 2011, with four 12-month options. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: The IHS shall provide all necessary equipment and supplies. The Wind River Service Unit will be responsible for getting the Contractor access and clearance to all computer services necessary to carry out his/her duties. COMPUTER SECURITY: All Federal agencies are required by the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) to complete a course in Computer Security Awareness Training (CSAT). Within HHS, there is a requirement for this training to be completed annually by all employees including all contractors, volunteers, students, summer externs, etcetera. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation; therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer. PROJECT OFFICER: The project officer shall be responsible for: (1) Monitoring the Contractors technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending technical changes; (2) Interpreting the Statement of Work; (3) Technical evaluation as required; (4) Technical inspections and acceptance; and (5) Assisting the Contractor in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance of this contract.

Payment shall be made by the Billings Area Financial Management Branch, P.O. Box 36600, Billings, Montana 59107. PRO-CHILDREN ACT OF 1994: The Contractor certifies that it will comply with the provisions of Public Law 103-227, Pro-Children Act of 1994, which imposes restrictions on smoking where federally funded children's services are provided. CHILD CARE NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK AND INVESTIGATION (CNACI). A CNACI must be completed for all Indian Health Service (IHS) contractor personnel within the Billings Area. Public Law (P.L.) 101-630, Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act and P.L. 101-647, Crime Control Act of 1990, require the IHS to conduct a character and criminal history background investigation on all contractors performing services in IHS facilities.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) and is unrestricted. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 200538 December 10, 2009.  The Government intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a single Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract with one (1) base year and four (4) option years.  <BR><BR>This solicitation is for a non-personal health care services contract, as defined in 37.101, under which the contractor is an independent contractor.  The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical, professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment.  The contractor indemnifies the Government for any liability producing act or omission by the contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance.  The Government requires the contractor maintain medical liability insurance, in coverage amounts which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned.   The contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services, contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance.  The minimum order amount for the contract is $1,000 and the maximum contract amount over the life of the contract, including all options if exercised, is $750,000.<BR><BR>Primary place of performance is Togus VA Hospital, Augusta, ME, with periodic performance at various armory locations throughout the State of Maine.  Description of requirement: The Maine Army National Guard (MEARNG) requires Periodic Health Assessments (PHA) to include: dental screening and treatment, immunization updating, physical exams, phlebotomy, vision screening, womens health screening and MEDPROS and DENCLASS systems updating of service members during a one (1) year base period beginning 1 April 2010 with four (4) option years exercised at the discretion of the Government.  The contractor will be expected to set up equipment prior to the start of the event in order to ensure full operation of systems.  The government may inspect facilities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws.  (MEDPROS and DENCLASS are available through the Army Medical Operation Data System [MODS] at www.mods.army.mil.)   Performance Standards: In accordance with the Statement of Work, the contractor shall provide, in a fixed or mobile setting, all management, labor, material, equipment, certifications and supplies necessary to provide Medical services, dental examinations, dental treatments, health and dental record updating, MEDPROS and DENCLASS updating. <BR>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision at 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors---Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  Award will be made based on an evaluation of the criteria of price, past performance and technical capability.  Provision for Evaluation:  Award will be made to the contractor whose offer represents the Best Value to the Government. In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.304 and 15.305 and the clause at 52.212-2, the Government will consider the following for award: 1) Price; 2) Past Performance; 3) Technical Capability.  A consideration when evaluating technical capability will be continuity of personnel offered by the contractor.  Continuity of personnel will limit the need for constant training of new personnel month to month.  Past Performance and Technical Capability, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.  The offeror must demonstrate in the proposal the capability to meet all contract requirements through past performance at similar events (assessing military members for medical fitness to standards in accordance with Army Regulation 40-501, chapter 3, 7 and 8), either as the prime or first tier subcontractor, and by identification of key personnel that have past performance experience.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price standpoint.  Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss, or revise your proposal.  Offerors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their proposal. Request for such information does not constitute discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  <BR>Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs):  <BR>Priced 0001, Physician Services<BR>Priced 0002, Physician Assistant / Nurse Practioner Services<BR>Priced 0003, Registered Nurse Services<BR>Priced 0004, Phlebotomist Services<BR>Priced 0005, Dentist Services<BR>Priced 0006, Army Contractor Manpower Reporting Requirement (yearly requirement).

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation/Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NOI10056, a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-38 dated February 1, 2010. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business set-aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414, which has a business size standard of 500 employees. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intends to procure various biological kits on a sole source basis from Illumina, Inc. Item/Description/Quantity: 1) 4 PE Sample Prep Kit, #PE-102-1002, qty-1; 2) Multiplexing Sample Preparation Oligonucleotide Kit, #PE-400-1001, qty-1; 3) Multiplexing Sequencing Primer and PhiX Control Kit (Version 2), #PE-400-2002, qty-1; 4) 5 Paired End Cluster Generation Kit (Version 4), #PE-203-4005, qty-1; 5) 36 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Version 4), #FC-104-4002, qty-18; and 6) Shipping and Handling. The desired kits are designed to be compatible with the Illumina Genome Analyzer already in use in the laboratory under the Protocol Z01-AI-005033, T-Cell Immune Responses to HIV and Other Pathogens. Any attempts to change reagents for this particular application at this point would provide results inconsistent with previously gathered data. In addition, the relevance of various projects would be harmed because of the incompatibility of new data with data from previous trial runs; comparison would prove impossible with a change in reagents. Use of another reagent would nullify any technical support provided by the vendor, as well as any guarantees of accuracy made by Illumina regarding results produced using the Genome Analyzer. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) price, 2) capability to meet required specifications, and 3) delivery. Delivery shall be made 30 days from date of award. The government will award a fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor. The FOB terms are "Destination" and Net 30. FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders - Commercial Items; FAR 52.225-1, Buy American Act-Supplies; FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration. In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at http://orca.bpn.gov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201 (a). By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR at www.ccr.gov prior to award during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. [Note: Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration will make an offeror ineligible for award.] All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by the Agency. Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time on March 26, 2010. For delivery of responses through the Postal Service, the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Drive, Room 2NE52E, MSC 2811, Bethesda, Maryland 20817-4811.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful and a failed transition.</p>
<p>OTI's strategic objectives are based on the premise that fast, direct, and overt political development assistance is needed as a catalyst to move countries beyond crisis to stability. When a crisis occurs in a priority country, OTI has the ability to engage in that country and initiate a country program. A country program is designed to address the fundamental constraints prohibiting the country from emerging from crisis.</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. The typical OTI country strategy follows U. S. Government (USG) policy and directly involves: reshaping hard-line attitudes and perceptions; promoting democracy, human rights, and basic freedoms; disseminating objective information; and effecting positive political change -- wherever and whenever possible.</p>
<p>OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society, development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation, identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs, and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>In November 2007, USAID/OTI launched a new program in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), and in 2009 the program expanded into the North West Frontier Province (NWFP). The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA and NWFP, demonstrating a new commitment to the border region through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and, more recently, the FATA Development Authority (FDA), in order to attract investment to the region. In 2007, the FS produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region. The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), manages a program called the Pakistan Transition Initiative (PTI) aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities range across numerous sectors including, but not limited to, irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, and post-conflict reconstruction efforts, etc. In addition, the program is undertaking media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to fund a Field Program Manager to support USAID/OTI's Pakistan Transition Initiative in Pakistan. The Field Program Manager holds a management position primarily responsible for coordinating monitoring, evaluation, and reporting of activities within the overall PTI program. The Field Program Manager position will be responsible for the training and management of the PTI program's monitoring, evaluation and reporting staff and resources and will advise the PTI program on the conceptualization, design and implementation modalities necessary to deploy such in a complex, non-permissive, and highly sensitive political environment. The Field Program Manager should be prepared to direct, manage, and personally supervise the work of the individuals and organizations under his/her authority without the benefit of directly visiting PTI grant activity sites within Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas and North West Frontier Province.</p>
<p>The position is a tandem/ladder position. Applicants may submit applications for more than one position/grade level, but must submit a separate application for each. Applicants will be accepted/denied based on the position to which they applied (e.g., an applicant for the GS-13 position may not be accepted for a GS-12 position/grade level). If hired at the GS-12 equivalent level, the selected employee may be eligible for promotion to the GS-13 equivalent level. Promotion to the GS-13 level is not guaranteed, and may only occur after working a minimum of 12 months at the GS-12 level, and after receiving a recommendation for promotion by the supervisor as part of an excellent performance evaluation.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective for hiring for this position is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>The Field Program Manager will work closely with OTI implementing partner organizations in the management of relevant program monitoring, evaluation and reporting resources to devise strategies meant to interpret and use information for the general benefit of improving the tactical, programmatic and strategic impact of PTI. The Field Program Manager must demonstrate problem-solving skills and the ability to implement creative approaches at monitoring and evaluating the PTI program's activities in order to advise the OTI Country Representative and other members of the Senior Management Team of ways to improve the program's activities and modalities. Due to the rest and recuperation (R&amp;R) schedule, the Field Program Manager can expect to periodically assume, in addition to his/her own duties, the responsibilities of one or both the OTI Deputy Country Representative and the OTI Country Representative. The Field Program Manager must demonstrate professional maturity and ability to effectively represent OTI to the high volume of delegations consistently visiting Pakistan. The Field Program Manager must also demonstrate personal maturity given the pervasive proximity of peers and supervisors in both professional and social settings at all hours of the day. Because of the likeliness of changes in program direction and implementation, the Field Program Manager must be a highly flexible individual capable of redesigning his/her roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>The successful candidate must also be willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success.</p>
<p>The Field Program Manager is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia Middle East Regional Team and will be based in Islamabad, Pakistan. Due to the unpredictable security situation, it is important to note that Pakistan is a non-accompanied post, and movement of USG personnel, including USPSCs, is heavily restricted.</p>

<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office. The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; Pretoria, South Africa, and Budapest, Hungary.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who are supported by the Regional Advisors (RAs). The Program Officer's primary responsibility is to assist the PRAs or RAs with assessment and monitoring of existing or evolving crises, maintenance of partner relationship, and facilitation of award management activities. The Program Officer (PO) will also work closely with the Agreement Officer's Technical Representative (AOTR) for all assigned awards and the Regional Team, both of which are located in OFDA/Washington (OFDA/W). It is expected that the PO, under the guidance of the PRA or RA, will also coordinate closely with Embassy and USAID Mission staff where applicable.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of French-speaking Program Officers for identified regional offices in which French is critical to the daily operations.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OFDA Program Officer will primarily assist with coordination and management of OFDA's humanitarian emergency efforts in the area of responsibility, under the direction of the PRA or RA. This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff in-country and in Washington, DC, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices, embassies and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style. The Program Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.</p>
<p>The Program Officer's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the principal in-country point of contact for OFDA assistance awardees operating in the area of responsibility and advise the OFDA AOTR on award issues from development through implementation.</p>
<p>&bull; In close coordination with the PRA, RA, Regional Coordinator (RC), and Disaster Operations Specialist (DOS), work with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs), and United Nations (UN) agencies that are developing proposals for OFDA (including grant amendments and extensions). Ensure that draft proposals are in compliance with "OFDA's Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting." Review concept papers and proposals, and provide recommendations/comments to OFDA for final funding determination.</p>
<p>&bull; Participate, as requested by the PRA or RA, in a broad spectrum of assessments of emergency conditions and assist in the development of programmatic recommendations and implementation mechanisms for OFDA's response programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain regular contact with OFDA grantees, as well as other UN agencies, IOs, and NGOs. As requested by the PRA or RA, meet regularly with donors, host government officials, United States Government (USG) agencies, and others on humanitarian issues in order to explain, advocate for, and advance OFDA's priorities and to help coordinate USG and international humanitarian activities.</p>
<p>&bull; In close coordination with the PRA or RA, travel frequently to assess, evaluate and monitor conditions at OFDA project sites and to make recommendations for interventions in the area of responsibility. Report to OFDA AOTR and the PRA or RA on the quality of the grantee's work, noting deficiencies, attributes and evolving operational conditions.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in the area of responsibility. Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keep the PRA or RA current on response issues. Provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts. Assist the PRA or RA with the communication of this information to OFDA/W.</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare agendas and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in humanitarian assistance activities in the region of assignment, serve as a critical component of a USG disaster assessment team, DART, RMT, or backfill other staff members in the overseas office, in response to crisis situations.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />Dependent upon site location, the Program Officer may report to the Principal Regional Advisor for the region of assignment or the Senior Humanitarian Advisor for a specific country. The Program Officer will also be expected to maintain close coordination with the Regional Team in Washington, D.C., as appropriate.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will set overall objectives and will work with the Program Officer to determine deadlines and work priorities. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and perform with moderate direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies as part of a fast-paced office environment.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.

<DESC>Economic Price Adjustment Quotation Option Added and Response Date Changed.
<p>-------------------------</p>
<p>Due to the fluctuation in prices of PVC material, this contract may include an economic price adjustment (EPA) clause. (Please refer to FAR clause 52.216-2 Economic Price Adjustment-Standard Supplies in this solicitation for more information on economic price adjustment.)</p>
<p>The new response date for solicitation responses is moved to Thursday, March 18, 2010 at 3:00pm central time.</p>
<p>Offerors are given the option to either provide fixed-priced quotations incorporating an EPA, or to provide quotations on a fixed-price basis without an EPA. If an EPA clause is incorporated into the contract, the Contracting Specialist and the Contractor will review the prices for the contract line items 002 - 003 on an annual basis to determine if the fixed contract prices need to be adjusted by either increasing or decreasing them based on the current market price and relevant price indexes for PVC. The determination of a competitive market price for any price adjustments will be based an index such as the monthly Chemical Data database pricing for U.S. Polyvinyl Chloride, or a similar pricing index that a contractor might propose using. If the price index demonstrates that the cost of the line item(s) has increased or decreased, the price of the line item(s) will be adjusted accordingly. Adjustments in the contract price will only be allowed for the portion of the item's cost that is the material cost and in accordance with the limitations of FAR 52.216-2. Contractors must identify the percentage of the item's cost that is the material cost. No EPA will be allowed on the remaining percentage of the item's cost such as, but not limited to, material handling, administration, overhead, and profit. The type of offer submitted (with an EPA or without EPA) will be an additional factor in the "best value" evaluation criteria for awarding the contract.</p>

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION, A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 for full and open competition.  

The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for the tasks identified below: 


Services and Prices/Costs

Labor/Cost Category	Rate	U/I	Quantity	Total Price
				
				
				

Background

The Office of Biostatistics needs a biomedical statistician to review routine submissions but also complex submissions that require a high level of statistical expertise and experience.  There are several current areas of critical importance to the Division that require significant statistical expertise.  Two of the most important areas are adaptive clinical trial designs and the assessment of cardiovascular (CV) risk in drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Statement of Work

Tasks

The Contractor shall write statistical reviews and evaluations of clinical data contained in New Drug Applications (NDAs), Investigational New Drug (IND) submissions, and related documents.  Data to be reviewed are those submitted from drug sponsors primarily to the Division of Metabolic and Endocrine Products (DMEP) within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at FDA. 

The Contractor will define and develop new formulas, tests, procedures and refine existing procedures as necessary to evaluate new, novel or complex problems. 

Responsibilities include attending and participating in internal meetings with FDA staff and industry meetings with drug sponsors to discuss their drug development programs.  To enhance interaction between the Contractor, FDA staff and industry, it is required that attendance at both internal and industry meetings be on-site (FDA headquarters at White Oak, Maryland) and not off-site via telecom.  It is estimated there will be two to three such meetings per week.

The Contractor shall study the statistical literature to maintain proficiency in statistical expertise with particular attention to statistical methods related to adaptive clinical trial designs, non-inferiority designs and trial designs for the assessment of CV risk in drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

The Contractor shall keep the Project Officer informed of progress on IND and NDA written reviews.

Knowledge/Skills

The Contractor shall have extensive knowledge of statistical theory and methods as applied to adaptive clinical trial designs, non-inferiority designs and clinical trials for the assessment of CV risk.  The Contractor shall also have a thorough knowledge of survival analyses and meta-analytic techniques as well as expertise in clinical trial design and statistical methods.

The Contractor must be able to immediately begin and satisfactorily complete work assignments without formal training.  As such, the Contractor must have experience as a statistical reviewer of IND and NDA submissions containing clinical trials involving the assessment of CV risk in drugs for the treatment of metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes or hyperlipidemia.

The Contractor should be able to interact frequently with medical officers and project officers at FDA and with other technical disciplines as needed (clinical pharmacology, pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology, chemistry) in order to be a fully functioning member of the project team assigned to a specific IND or NDA.

The Contractor shall have the ability to communicate findings and statistical information verbally and in writing at an exceptional level.

The Contractor shall be free of financial conflicts of interest with the regulated industry.   Specifically, the Contractor may not hold financial interests in companies which are significantly regulated by the FDA consistent with current policies by the FDA Ethics Program that prohibit certain financial interests for FDA employees.

The contractor is entitled to paid leave corresponding to Federal holidays.

Supporting documentation about the experience, training, and education (e.g., CVs) of proposed personnel must be provided.  

2.  Understanding the Requirements & Technical Approach

Provide a comprehensive statement of the scope and purpose of the project to demonstrate complete understanding of the intent and requirements. This understanding indicates a clear comprehension and awareness of the contract objectives.

The price proposal shall not be included in the technical proposal. It shall be sent via email to the Contracting Officer as a separate document.

The Offerors proposal should present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan for achieving the objectives of the scope of work. Technical proposals shall not merely paraphrase the requirements of the Agencys scope of work or parts thereof, or use of phrases such as will comply or standard techniques will be employed.

<DESC>Contractor shall provide all materials as per attached specifications to the Walker and Blackduck Ranger District offices.  Delivery will be April 14 and April 15th as determined by the contractor to each office.  Acceptable delivery hours are between 8:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.

Line item number three is hereby changed from a quantity of 312 to a quantity of 112

The following information and/or questions & answers are added for clarification:


The wood and materials needed will be subject to outdoor weather conditions and will be used where human contact is possible, (although not sustained for long periods of time/hours) 

1.       Species and grade of solid sawn lumber?   Softwood, construction grade; rough cut for 4 x4, and 6x6 and posts; softwood 2x10's No.2 or better 
2.       Should sawn lumber be free of wane?    Appropriate with lumber grade used 
3.       Any restrictions on knot size? Appropriate with lumber grade used 
4.       Specie for plywood?  Just cheapest?   No species specified. 
5.       Treatment for posts, plywood and sawn lumber.  What is acceptable?  Should we base this on intended use?   Treated wood that is approved for human contact, such as ACQ (Alkaline copper quat) or CA (Copper azole).  CCA (Chromated copper arsenate) not to be used.   
6.       Will plywood be in contact with the ground?  No. 
7.       Delivery will be made by commercial flatbed truck.  What are your unloading capabilities at both jobsites?  We typically require the customer to provide mechanized unloading.  The job site at Blackduck Ranger District has a "loading" ramp to facilitate unloading of trucks, including the flatbed.  The job site at Walker Ranger District does not.  Typically, hand unloading is performed @ Walker.  Forklift possible but would require mobilization from Cass Lake Supervisor's office to either Blackduck or Walker and would require communications between vendor and unit before delivery.   
8.       Do you require the hardware to be galvanized?  Yes 
9.       Should the round posts be peeled?  Yes 
10.   Do you require the round posts to be turned on a lathe for exact uniform diameter or is natural taper acceptable?  Natural taper is acceptable.   

1. What type of treatment would you like for the lumber?  Treated wood that is approved for human contact, such as ACQ (Alkaline copper quat) or CA (Copper azole).  CCA (Chromated copper arsenate) not to be used. 
2. What species of wood are you looking for? softwood generally used for intended applications. 
3. What thickness of plywood do you need?   3/4"

Government Response to contractors question

1. After reading and rereading the SOW it remains unclear to me the DOJ preferred method d of pricing. Is the DOJ looking for and hourly rate per task or a flat rate per task or some other method?

Response: We are looking for a fixed per drop cost, inclusive of labor for the majority of our projects.  We also have to have a mechanism to have hourly labor rate to address certain situations wherein additional labor may be necessary due to a construction or an emergency situation which is beyond the Governments control.


2. No where in the SOW or in the accompanying Excel spread sheet are the number of network drops per office defined. Is that information available?

Response: At minimum, each office will have two (2) data drops.  Specific requirements are identified by local USAO personnel and submitted to EOUSA after the project is approved.  


3. This is a very large requirement for a small business will DOJ consider dividing the requirement into geographical regions?


Response: The Program Management team must be based in Washington, DC.  EOUSA is interested in options available to address the nationwide cable project requirement.


4. Will the DOJ consider holding a pre-bid conference?

Response: EOUSA intends on conducting on-site, oral presentations for contractor proposals.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in the Asia Middle East Region, in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, OTI will focus its program on four main objectives in Sri Lanka's Northern and Eastern Provinces: 1) improve public confidence and community-level perceptions of security, 2) improve institutional capabilities to engage the full range of rehabilitation needs for at-risk youth, 3) improve access to more reliable news and information on issues of local importance, 4) and carry out high impact community activities. Beginning priorities for the program will be supporting the safe and effective return of populations that is already underway to their communities of origin, followed quickly by recovery assistance and support to begin reconstituting a healthy social and political fabric. As the context develops, OTI will then begin assisting citizens in more political and social dimensions of the post-conflict transition process as opportunities emerge.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above in both countries. It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to media, stabilization, and peace-building activities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of hiring for this position is to support OTI programs and the OTI Country Representative.</p>
<p><br />9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This is a middle management position requiring excellent managerial and communication skills, an ability to perform in a complex and highly sensitive political environment, experience in policy formulation and negotiation at the highest levels (government and non-government organizations), and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition. The candidate must be mature, self-reliant, a team player, a problem-solver, and able to manage a diverse portfolio of grants. S/he should have extensive management experience (both project and personnel) and understand the basics of grantee and contractor/USAID relationships. S/he should be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, USG agencies, and clerics or other religious leaders. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.</p>
<p>The successful candidate must also be willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia Middle East Regional Team and will be based in Colombo, Sri Lanka or another location in the Northern or Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka to be determined.</p>
<p>The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with United States Government (USG) agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in the monitoring and evaluation of OTI-sponsored activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in managing the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants, and drivers.</p>
<p>&bull; Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull; Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) FSN staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting country representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required; and</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will report directly to the Country Representative in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Assessments or during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>
<p>12. START DATE: Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.</p>
<p>13. POINT OF CONTACT: See Cover Letter.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI plans to launch two new programs in the Asia Middle East Region, one in Sri Lanka, and one in Yemen.</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, OTI will focus its program on four main objectives in Sri Lanka's Northern and Eastern Provinces: 1) improve public confidence and community-level perceptions of security, 2) improve institutional capabilities to engage the full range of rehabilitation needs for at-risk youth, 3) improve access to more reliable news and information on issues of local importance, 4) and carry out high impact community activities. Beginning priorities for the program will be supporting the safe and effective return of populations that is already underway to their communities of origin, followed quickly by recovery assistance and support to begin reconstituting a healthy social and political fabric. As the context develops, OTI will then begin assisting citizens in more political and social dimensions of the post-conflict transition process as opportunities emerge.</p>
<p>In Yemen, OTI will initiate a program in support of USAID's broader Stabilization Through Development Strategy. USAID's overarching strategic goal in Yemen is: increased stability through targeted interventions in highly vulnerable areas. OTI's engagement will focus on relatively short-term development programming tailored to address the drivers of instability in specific areas of the country and to respond quickly and directly to the articulated needs and frustrations of communities in the most unstable areas. The location and number of areas of focus will be delineated over time and in coordination with Mission, interagency and donor colleagues.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above in both countries. It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to media, stabilization, and peace-building activities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified country representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>

<p>&bull; If required, travel to other or potential OTI field locations and/or Washington, DC to provide consultations on OTI field programming through assessments, country program reviews, or consultations.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 15.403).  Contractor will be responsible for meeting requirements in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) (DOD 5105.38-M), and Air Force Manual 23-110, International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).   The PROS contract is a Tri-Se! rvice program designed to acquire procurement services to meet the needs of our FMS Air Force, Navy and Army partners.  North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services.  The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners.  Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts.  The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC.  This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor.  The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed.  It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment.  We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots.  Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: 
Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc)
The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support.   
These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options.  The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars.  
This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government.
Capabilities Package:  All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services.  Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services.  The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.  RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009.  
The PROS Program team will hold an industry day at the Hilton, Garden Inn, 3250 Pentagon Park Boulevard, Beavercreek OH 45431 on Thursday 17 Dec 2009 from 09:00 till 15:00.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The purpose of this amendment to the synopsis is to change the closing date from March 31, 2010 to June 25, 2010. Please read below. All other terms and conditions remain the same.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the responsibility of enhancing national capabilities for decontamination and disposal as a result of terrorist events and environmental sampling and analysis of all environmental matrices in response to nationally significant incidents (NSI). To protect the nation from the potential threats posed by terrorism or environmental emergencies, the EPA implemented the Environmental Response Laboratory Network (ERLN). The ERLN is one of five laboratory response networks under the Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The mission of the ERLN is to provide known laboratory capabilities, capacities, and quality data in a scalable, systematic, and coordinated response to environmental emergencies providing preparedness, response, remediation and recovery analytical support. Consequently, the USEPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of analyzing environmental sample matrices contaminated by toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), chemical warfare agents (CWAs), biological agents, and radiochemical agents as a result of acts of terrorism or an environmental emergency. A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition. 
Potential vendors' viability will be evaluated on the following six factors: Accredited Quality System, Plans and Procedures, Sample Management System, Facilities for Sample Handling and Storage, Data Management and Exchange, and Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The ERLN review team will review these documents and calculate a score for the application based on criteria established by the EPA. This score is used to determine if the laboratory is eligible for ERLN and, as applicable, Water Laboratory Alliance (WLA) membership.

This requirement will be posted for approximately  90 days with a closing date of June 25,  2010 at 3:00 pm EST. A copy of this request for quote (RFQ) # RFQ-DC-09-00337 including attachments will be available at the following locations: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm, and https://www.fbo.gov/.
Please submit ERLN application packet via electronic mail or in hard copy form to EPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) using the address provided below. No phone calls please.

<AWARDEE>Northrop Grumman TASC, 2411 Dulles Corner Park, Herndon, VA 20171-3430
<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Centers (GSFC's) negotiated a sub-task order withNorthrop Grumman Information Technologies an effort to test software to meet the needs ofour particular use implementing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Underexisting indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity Task Order NNG06HN01D, NG will provideall necessary support services to perform an analysis entitled, "Accelerator Technologiesand Earth System Models". The goal of this Order is to have NG evaluate the suitabilityof the current generation of hardware "accelerators" (e.g. commercial products such asthe NVIDIA Tesla series of graphical processing units (GPU's)). This class ofcommercially available processors can potentially improve performance of key aspects ofNASA's weather and climate models. The Contractor's evaluation should primarily analyzethe potential performance benefits against the labor costs for adapting NASA's softwareto exploit this technology. In addition to the software costs, the Contractor willanalyze costs associated with integrating accelerators within a computing environmentincluding power and cooling considerations. The computational kernels of NASA'sweather/climate models to be considered within this task are: 1)Solar radiation (SORAD)component from the GEOS-5 model; 2) Cubed-sphere Finite Volume Dynamical Core (CSFVCore);and 3) Sparse Matrix Vector Gear Code (SMVGEAR) from the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI)model. &lt;P&gt;For each of these kernels, NG shall perform an initial evaluation to determine the beststrategy for studying the potential performance impact of accelerator technology. When afull port for a given kernel is not feasible, NG shall provide a written explanation ofboth the nature of the difficulty and a rationale for a proposed alternativeimplementation where appropriate. This explanation shall also estimate the possible errorin the performance estimation due to such simplifications. NG shall commit the finalimplementation prototypes to the sourcemotel.gsfc.nasa.gov repository. &lt;P&gt;NG shall deliver a draft and final version of a comprehensive report which summarizes thepotential performance impact of accelerator technologies for NASA Earth system modeling.This document must address the degree to which the selected kernels are representative ofthe computational work on NASA's high-end computers. The document must also estimate theconversion/maintenance costs associated with migrating full models to exploit acceleratortechnologies. The report must estimate the potential for future support for compilerand/or Fortran support (e.g. Portland Group GPU Fortran directives) for using thistechnology within scientific models. GSFC will make the final report available to thepublic. The following lists the deliverables under this Sub-Task Order: 1)Weekly: oralstatus reports to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR); 2) Start + 4weeks: Written evaluation strategy for all 3 computational kernels delivered to COTR andContracting Officer (CO); 3) Start + 20 weeks: Prototype implementation of all 3computational kernels delivered to COTR; 4)Start + 22 weeks: Draft version of acomprehensive report described above delivered to the COTR. GSFC will return it'spreliminary 2 business weeks from receipt for further processing to NG; and 5) Start + 24weeks: Final version of a comprehensive report described above delivered to the COTR andthe CO. &lt;P&gt;The existing Task Order is a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee arrangement awarded to NG 10/2005 on acompetitive basis.  CPAF was determined appropriate because the contract is for theperformance of research and development effort, and uncertainties involved in contractperformance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to any type offixed-price contract.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO UNISYS CORPORATION, FOR REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Pub.L. 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of award of Delivery Order 0052 issued against an existing contract (TIRNO-D-08-00003).  This purchase includes hardware upgrades, one Central Processing Unit (CPU) and one Capacity Backup feature (CBU), to existing IRS IBM z9 mainframe processors.  The delivery order was a firm-fixed price action issued against an existing indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract awarded to Unisys Corp., a large business.

The delivery order was awarded to Unisys Corp. without further competition because only Unisys can provide the continuity and expert level of service the IRS requires in maintaining the security and integrity of the Tier 1 (mainframe) computing systems.  These computing systems are critical components of the IRSs tax collection infrastructure and must be available on an uninterrupted basis for processing tax returns and providing the public access to electronic filing, online tax manuals and other critical tax related activities.

The CPU and CBU being acquired will become one of hundreds of parts functioning together within each mainframe being upgraded.  Unisys has a contract with IRS to maintain these mainframes.  Introducing another vendor to provide, warrant, and maintain specific parts within those mainframes would have introduced complexities and unacceptable risks into the maintenance process.  It would have interfered with Unisyss ability to provide, and IRSs ability to enforce, contractually-defined service levels.

These hardware upgrades are needed to support new workloads in the IRS mainframe environment.  Mission critical tax applications will be affected by the changes implemented by ARRA such that increased volumes and changes will require additional processing resources.  The workloads include processing new Business Master File tax forms and handling increased volumes of queries to support customer interactions with the IRS for other tax application systems such as Corporate File OnLine.  This acquisition will provide the additional processor capacity needed to process these workloads.

<AWDNBR>NSFPRSS-0000373
<ARCHDATE>04122010
<DESC><p><br />Justification and Approval<br />For Other Than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p><br />1. Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF)<br />Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support<br />4201 Wilson Blvd.<br />Arlington, VA 22230</p>
<p>2. Action Being Approved:</p>
<p>The NSF intends to extend Raytheon Polar Services Company (RPSC) contract number NSFPRSS-0000373, Science, Operations and Maintenance Support for the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), for a one (1) year period from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011.</p>
<p>The contract was originally awarded on October 28, 1999 with a phase-in period (from November 1, 1999 to March 31, 2000), a basic period (from April 1, 2000 to March 31, 2005) and option period (from April 1, 2005 to March 31, 2010) which was exercised on September 23, 2004. The estimated value of the one-year extension should not exceed $172 million.</p>
<p>The one-year extension is required for two reasons:</p>
<p>1) The NSF requires continuity of its operations in the Antarctic as it concurrently<br />completes the competitive source selection process for the evaluation of proposals received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) DACS08P2215 (this will be referred to as the "Antarctic Support Contract (ASC)" throughout this document to distinguish it from the on-going RPSC contract number NSFPRSS-0000373); and</p>
<p>2) Although the anticipated award of the ASC will occur by the end of summer, <br />2010, the NSF requires continuity of its operations in the Antarctic by the incumbent during the ASC six-month transition-in period. Due to austral season constraints (see below for additional information), the transition-in period can only occur during the Antarctic summer period which normally lasts from October through March. Therefore, the transition-in is anticipated to occur from October 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011. To be effective, the transition-in for the ASC must be concurrent with performance by the incumbent. RPSC services will be required through March 31, 2011.</p>
<p>3. Description of Services:</p>
<p>RPSC is providing all labor, materials, facilities management, and construction engineering support and utilizes government-furnished equipment to provide the science, operations and maintenance support for the USAP.</p>
<p>The scope of the RPSC contract is extensive and includes, but is not limited to, the following services, which also describes those services to be performed under the proposed one-year extension:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide direct and indirect support to the scientific research activities being conducted by USAP grantees in Antarctica;<br />&bull; Operate and maintain a project office, staging areas in the United States, New Zealand, South America, and other facilities, as required;<br />&bull; Operate and maintain all laboratories, facilities, buildings, and camps in Antarctica, including the three year-round facilities in Antarctica - McMurdo, South Pole, and Palmer Station;<br />&bull; Provide facilities management services for the USAP to include design, engineering, construction and maintenance;<br />&bull; Obtain supplies and equipment to support USAP activities in accordance with government specifications and procurement standards;<br />&bull; Provide transportation for and coordinate transportation provided by other organizations for air, land, and sea movement of contractor, grantee, and other USAP personnel, materials and supplies. Maintain transport and research vehicles owned or leased by the USAP;<br />&bull; Implement and maintain the information technology and communications infrastructure used by the USAP at all locations. Ensure enterprise level compliance with USAP information assurance and information security policies and guidelines;<br />&bull; Implement and monitor USAP environmental, safety and health programs. Comply with the spirit and conditions of controlling regulations and respond to NSF direction in these areas;<br />&bull; When directed, obtain and manage all subcontracts necessary to support USAP operations, to include research vessels;<br />&bull; Maintain close communications with the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) through regular meetings, written status reports, and financial statements; <br />&bull; Remain flexible to the special needs of the USAP and OPP, and provide practical solutions to complex situations as they arise.</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority:</p>
<p>Title 41 U.S.C. &sect; 253 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. RPSC is the only responsible source that can provide these services for the one-year period of performance extension.</p>
<p>5. Contractor's Unique Qualifications and Austral Seasonal Constraints:</p>
<p>RPSC is uniquely positioned to fulfill this requirement to ensure the USAP mission is not compromised. RPSC has been the USAP support provider since 2000 and is currently in the last year of the performance period. RPSC operates and maintains the entire NSF-owned infrastructure that supports the USAP on a yearlong basis, including McMurdo, South Pole, and Palmer Stations. RPSC also holds the assignable subcontracts for the operation of the two research vessels that support the USAP. Operations, logistics, and research support in Antarctica is highly specialized and requires extensive knowledge of and experience with remote logistics, construction, and environmental compliance.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are austral seasonal constraints which must be considered in order to meet USAP mission requirements. In the Antarctic, extreme conditions make aircraft landings possible only during the summer season. The summer season in the Antarctic generally runs from October through March and the winter season runs from April through September. Because the weather in the Antarctic is warmer during the summer, air travel to the region is possible. However, during the Antarctic winter, weather conditions prevent travel to the area. This inability to travel from April through September impacts the time-line for continued program performance. Therefore, during a large part of the year, no other contractor can reach the Antarctic. RPSC is currently in the region and positioned to provide continued support during the aforementioned evaluation phase of the re-competition and transition-in period.</p>
<p>Due to the large, complex scope of USAP operations support and the extremely remote hostile working environment, a six-month overlap with the incumbent contractor is necessary for a successful transition to a new contractor. This transition period must occur during the October through March timeframe to coincide with the Antarctic summer season to ensure ingress and egress to the region. Consequently, the timeline for this contract extension includes six months for new contract award and a six month transition-in period for a total of twelve months (i.e. April 1, 2010 - March 31, 2011).</p>
<p>NSF's requirement to complete its competitive source selection, allow for a transition-in period, and continue to support ongoing commitments to international research programs and other US government agencies, makes this a mission critical requirement. A disruption to these services would result in immense harm to the U.S. Government and those individuals supported by this contract. Accordingly, RPSC is the only vendor with the ability and personnel to continue the required support without interruption and adverse impact to the USAP mission.</p>
<p>6. Efforts made to Obtain Competition:</p>
<p>NSF published a synopsis for the one-year extension to RPSC on a sole source basis for the continued support of the USAP. The synopsis was published in the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) on October 7, 2009 (refer to FBO, PRSS-0000373.2010). One response was received and reviewed by NSF. NSF has found the company to be qualified. However, unacceptable risk would threaten the probability of successful performance by any company other than the incumbent. Due to timing constraints of the austral season, the incumbent is the only vendor in a position to meet the agency's goals without undue risk which would adversely impact the mission of the United States Antarctic Program. This is due to the very limited time frame to ingress and egress from the Antarctic as explained in Section 5 above. <br />Previously, NSF sought competition for the ASC requirement and is currently evaluating the proposals received in response to RFP DACS08P2215, which closed February 23, 2009. Originally, award was anticipated in summer 2009. However, due to robust competition, voluminous proposal materials and the ongoing thorough assessments in accordance with the evaluation criteria, the timeline for awarding the new ASC contract has been extended. NSF now anticipates contract award at the end of the summer 2010. <br />7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:<br />The Contracting Officer (CO) will make an affirmative determination of a fair and reasonable price prior to award of the contract modification for the one-year extension. It is anticipated that the Defense Contract Audit Agency will perform a full pre-award audit in order to assist the CO in this determination.</p>
<p>8. Market Survey:</p>
<p>Previous market research conducted during the ASC requirements planning phase (prior to the release of the ASC RFP) indicated that there were multiple sources interested in competing to provide USAP logistics support services. While it was expected that the same interest would be present for the one-year extension, this was not the case. Only one source responded to the one-year extension synopsis.</p>
<p>Due to the above mentioned constraints, award of a one-year performance period (for the extension) to any company other than the incumbent would result in unacceptable risks and threaten the probability of successful performance of the USAP mission.</p>
<p>9. Additional Information: None.</p>
<p>10. Other Sources Expressing an Interest:</p>
<p>Other than the incumbent, only one vendor expressed an interest in the one-year extension. Normally, NSF would list the names of vendors that have identified an interest in supporting the USAP. However, because of the sensitive nature of the in-process competitive source selection this information will not be disclosed.</p>
<p>11. Removing Barriers to Competition:</p>
<p>As discussed above, there are no barriers to competition.</p>

Description of Requirement: Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) Core Application Development, Support, Maintenance, & Training IHS OIT 
Cimarron Medical Informatics will continue tasks outlined in the SOW that provides software design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and technical user support for RPMS applications.

Limited Source Justification
This justification is to put in place a bridge for a period of (3 months, plus 3  1 month options) to allow time for a proper recompete.  The requirement will remain unchanged for the bridge period.  Bringing on a new vendor, for a short 3 month period would not be cost efficient nor in the best interest of the government.  The incumbent contractor is in place and performing satisfactorily.  A new contractor would result in a transition of personnel and a learning curve for a new contractor to become proficient at the tasks being accomplished.  In the interest of economy and efficiency, the issuance of a bridge is in the best interest of the government and will result in the lowest overall cost to the government for meeting this immediate need.  Based on the scope remaining unchanged, and the fact that the current effort was competed, this action meets the requirements of FAR 8.405-6.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION FOR A U.S. PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT
<p><br />This document is a justification for other than full and open competition for a Personal Services Contract (PSC) as authorized by Section 6.303-1(a) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).</p>
<p>Chapter 7 of Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations, contains procurement regulations supplemental to the FAR (the USAID Acquisition Regulations or AIDAR). Subpart 706.3 - Other than Full and Open Competition, contains additional authorities that permit the use of other than full and open competition. Specifically, Subpart 706.302-70 authorizes other than full and open competition when full and open competition would impair or otherwise have an adverse effect on programs conducted for the purposes of foreign aid, relief and rehabilitation. Below is the citation from the AIDAR:</p>
<p>706.302-70 Impairment of foreign aid programs. <br />(a) Authority. <br />(1) Citation: 40 U.S.C. 474. <br />(2) Full and open competition need not be obtained when it would impair or otherwise have an adverse effect on programs conducted for the purposes of foreign aid, relief, and rehabilitation. <br />(b) Application. <br />This authority may be used for: <br />(1) An award under Section 636(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, involving a personal services contractor serving abroad; <br />((c) Limitations. <br />(2) The contract file must include appropriate explanation and support justifying the award without full and open competition, as provided in FAR 6.303...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition".</p>
<p>This justification for other than full and open competition is for use by the Regional USAID Mission to Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova in the acquisition of services in support of Mission operations in Moldova.</p>
<p><br />2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>This justification is for a new, off-shore, U.S. Personal Services Contract with a qualified candidate ("the Candidate"), contract no. 121-S-00-10-00609.</p>
<p>3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Agency's needs (including the estimated value).</p>
<p>This Justification is for a new USPSC contract of approximately 1 year, with an estimated value of $190,000. The position has been classified by the Contracting Officer as a GS-15. The following is from the Statement of Duties:</p>
<p>The Acting Country Director/Country Program Officer for USAID/Moldova will serve as USAID's principal officer in Chisinau and as such will manage an organizational unit comprised of the Office of the Director, a Program Office and economic growth and democracy and governance teams with a total of 2 USDH employees, 1-2 US PSCs, 25-30 FSN employees, and up to two Development Leadership Initiative Junior Officers. He/she will directly oversee all program and operational planning, non-USDH management (and USDH, if approved by the Assistant Administrator for Management), monitoring, and resource allocation/budgeting functions for the Moldova Mission while ensuring adherence to Agency, Mission and programming policy. He/she will oversee the appropriate allocation of services and resources to support USAID programs in accordance with overall USG priorities. As the Acting Country Director/Country Program Officer, he/she will lead coordination and dialogue with the Government of Moldova and oversee donor coordination and outreach activities. He/She will represent the Regional Mission Director for Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus (UMB) in Moldova, serve as a member of the Senior U.S. Country Team and represent USAID's assistance programs for Moldova to the Embassy, public at large, the international community, and in regional fora.</p>
<p>The Country Program Officer will work under the general guidance of the<br />U.S. Ambassador and will be supervised by the Regional Mission Director for UMB.</p>
<p>Specific areas of responsibility will include:</p>
<p>1. Representing USAID/Moldova in meetings with senior U.S. Government officials within USAID and State (including the Office of the Coordinator for Assistance to Europe and Eurasia).</p>
<p>2. Serving as central coordinator for the translation of policy and strategy for Moldova into country-specific and regional foreign assistance objectives and goals. In this regard, the contractor is responsible for the Country Assistance Strategy, the Operational Plan, and portions of the Mission Strategic Plan for Moldova.</p>
<p>3. Guiding and mentoring staff of the USAID/Moldova office in Chisinau. Serving as the point of contact for all USAID matters in Moldova. Provides oversight for ongoing liaison and collaboration with the U.S. Embassy in Moldova to ensure that USAID priorities and concerns are understood and acted on, and to facilitate exchange of information with respect to country situations.</p>
<p>4. Representing USAID/Moldova in meetings with USAID implementing partners, other international donors, and host country counterparts.</p>
<p>5. Traveling frequently within the country, regionally, and internationally to represent the interests of USAID/Moldova, to determine resource allocation and to attend host country governmental meetings.</p>
<p>6. Pending the decision of USAID/Washington, the incumbent may be responsible for actions related to standing up the Moldova Office as a Full Mission during 2010-2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 of Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations, contains procurement regulations supplemental to the FAR (the USAID Acquisition Regulations or AIDAR). Subpart 706.3 - Other than Full and Open Competition, contains authorities additional to the FAR that permit the use of other than full and open competition. Specifically, Subpart 706.302-70 authorizes other than full and open competition when full and open competition would impair or otherwise have an adverse effect on programs conducted for the purposes of foreign aid, relief and rehabilitation. This authority may be used for personal services contractors serving abroad. Below is the citation from the AIDAR:</p>
<p>706.302-70 Impairment of foreign aid programs. <br />(a) Authority. <br />(1) Citation: 40 U.S.C. 474.</p>
<p>As implemented by AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(2). An award of $250,000 or less by an overseas contracting activity.</p>
<p>5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>The services to be performed under this contract were originally going to be performed by the Candidate under a recall (i.e. direct) appointment. During the process of identifying a candidate for a recall appointment, done competitively to the extent practicable, it was determined that the Candidate was the most qualified candidate to be recalled. After lengthy discussions with the Office of Human Resources (OHR), however, the recall appointment could not be effected due to budgetary constraints at the central level of the Agency. Therefore, USAID/Ukraine was advised to and proposes to effect the appointment through an OE-funded USPSC. This position has been vacant since June, 2009 while the Mission waited for a suitable USDH assignment and then entered protracted discussions with OHR about a recall appointee. At this point in time, the additional time that it would take to effect a full and open competition would seriously impair our foreign aid program for Moldova. The Mission has been represented in Moldova by only one USDH, who is a first-tour JOPA, despite the fact that the Moldova program has been funded at close to $30 million in recent fiscal years. This USDH officer moreover will depart post this summer. The USAID program in Moldova cannot be effectively implemented with the current constrained staffing. In light of such needs, USAID must act immediately to provide necessary Mission leadership. Failure to do so will result in an impairment of USAID's foreign assistance objectives.</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that competition would result in a better candidate or less cost to the Government. The Candidate is ideally suited to fill this position. The position is equivalent to that of a Mission Director. The Candidate has served in two Senior Foreign Service positions in the former Soviet Union (including Deputy Mission Director at one major USAID post and Mission Director in another major USAID post). The Candidate has worked as the TDY Acting Deputy Mission Director in Ukraine and has familiarity with the Moldova program through previous short-term PSC assignments. Critical to success in this position are Russian language skills, which she possesses. She also has outstanding interpersonal and mentoring skills which will be critical for dealing with the Government and the Embassy and for nurturing staff through a period of change. She has the required medical and security clearances and is available to start work in March 2010 and continue performance for a full year.</p>
<p><br />6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many sources as practical, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.</p>
<p>Under 48 CFR Part 705.202(b), the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development has determined after consultation with the Administrator for the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, that advance notice is not appropriate or reasonable for contract actions described in 706.302-70(b)(1) through (b)(3). Accordingly, this action was not synopsized.</p>
<p>(7) A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Since this position has been classified as a GS-15, the compensation is determined by the range for that grade, and therefore the cost to the Government will fall within that range. The Contracting Officer determines the price is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>(8) A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason why market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>As noted above, the pool of candidates with previous Senior Foreign Service experience with USAID, especially in this region and with the appropriate language skills, is very limited, as we know from our recent discussions with OHR. All known and available candidates have been considered. The position also requires immediate availability and current medical and security clearances, which would add time to the arrival date of a candidate without such clearances, and which might disqualify some otherwise qualified candidates. The Mission has recent experience in filling other GS-15 level PSC positions in Ukraine, and we have observed that 1) while Civil Service experience is available, there are fewer candidates who were foreign service officers, and fewer still who were Senior Foreign Service officers and 2) the available candidates are interested in short-term contracts, and do not want to relocate for a full year.</p>
<p>(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>None, as the acquisition falling under this justification has not been synopsized.</p>
<p>(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.</p>
<p>If this situation arises in the future, the Mission will conduct a full and open competition to the maximum extent possible.<br /><br />(12) Technical Office Representative's Certification that all supporting data that is the responsibility of the technical office and forms a basis of this justification is complete and accurate, to the best of the Technical Office Representative's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>______________________________________ _________________<br />Technical Office Representative, Date<br />Janina Jaruzelski, Mission Director</p>
<p>(13) Contracting Officer's Certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
