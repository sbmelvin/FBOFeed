Current qualified sources are: Pratt &amp; Whitney (52661)and Delta Industries (00270) IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. All proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.<br />It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. <br />Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.<br />Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other<br />restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Request for Written Quotation will be issued. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.</p>

The actual field work must be completed within 10 calendar days of the date of award. The final report must be submitted within 24 calendar days of the date of award. The final report must address the following: (1) the chemical composition or alloy used to fabricate the rotor spider and arm extensions.  This information shall include mechanical and/or heat treatments used to effect the material properties and the final material properties such as yield strength, ultimate strength, reduction in area, and elongation properties; (2) Welding procedures for the alloys used to fabricate the rotor spider and arm extensions.  Welding plans shall include as a minimum: preheat temperatures, rod or wire requirements, interpass temperature, post weld heat treatment. (3) An assessment, made by technical experts in the area of rotor design and fabrication, of the current condition of the generator rotor structure and risk associated with operating the unit in its current condition. (4) A list of all viable repair alternatives considered - each alternative must include a description, degree of equipment disassembly required, an order of magnitude estimate of life expectancy of the repairs (hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades, etc.), an engineering assessment of the alternative's benefits and risks, an estimate of lead time for materials or weldments, a cost estimate of the repair alternative to two significant digits, recommendations of possible repair alternative combinations, i.e. temporary weld repairs combined with crack detection across the weld and heat effected zone that will allow us to operate the unit while new arm extensions are fabricated. This Request for Quotation will be completed in accordance with the procedures in Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 12 and 13. The North American Industrial Classification Code is 541330 and the Small Business Size Standard is $4.5 Million. The Request for Quotation will be posted to www.fedbizopps.gov on February 5, 2009 and quotes will be due on February 25, 2009. Since Unit 1 is currently not operating, completion of this inspection and assessment is time critical to the Government.

<DESC>Grouse Survey:

The contractor will conduct lek surveys in the contract area in spring 2009.  The contract area is defined as that portion of the Little Missouri National Grassland that is in western Slope County, North Dakota.  

Lek surveys will entail finding new leks as well as determining whether or not previously located leks are still active.  A final report will be written as requested in Report Requirements.  Work is to begin by March 15, 2008 and finish by August 31, 2009. 

There are approximately 106,000 acres of National Forest System land in the contract area.

CONTRACTOR QUALIFICATIONS:
B.S., M.S. or Ph.D. in zoology, biology, or related field experience. 
One or more field seasons of experience in grouse surveying.
One or more field seasons experience as principle investigator on a grouse survey project. 

This surveys purpose is to locate and map most or all of the occupied sharp-tailed leks in the study area.  The Forest Service recognizes that locating every single lek might require intensive field work.  It is more important that the entire study area be covered rather than every lek be located.   Although the number of birds at each lek is of interest, it is the lek location that is of primary importance.  Therefore, this survey should be considered extensive, rather than intensive, in nature.   The data collected will be used by the USDA Forest Service for future management and planning decisions

A complete Solicitation Package will be uploaded into FedBizOpps by close of business February 9, 2009.  Final bids will be due March 2, 2009.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

Period of performance: Twelve (12) months from date of award.

The Laboratory of Population Genetics (LPG) is collaborating in several projects involving genotyping clinical samples for genetic markers involved in cancer susceptibility and in response to cancer treatments. LPG has explored several different current technologies that vary in their DNA requirements and in their ability to generate DNA sequence for genotyping as well as DNA sequencing. 

This research is supported by a number of complex instrument systems, including an Applied Biosytems 3130 Automated Sequencer, an Applied Biosytems 3730XL Automated Sequencer, 2 9700-96Well Sample Modules, and an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System, which require annual preventive maintenance and occasional upgrades and repairs.  These service requirements can only be procured from the manufacturer of the instrument systems in order to: 1) maintain the original instruments guarantees and agreements; 2) be implemented by properly trained staff; and 3) have access to the proper replacement parts and reagents.  This current request follows the original purchase whose warranty expires and has been renewed annually for the current lifetime of the instrument system.  It is anticipated that annual renewals of service contracts will occur each year for the instrument systems.

The Laboratory of Population Genetics (LPG) requires use of these genomic analysis instrument systems for their research efforts.  These automated genomic analysis instruments were designed by Applied Biosystems (AB). They require professional maintenance including scheduled service visits and periodic part replacement. Continuous service requires a renewable service contract.  Applied Biosystems is the only reliable firm that is capable of repairing and maintaining these state-of -the art Applied Biosystems Automated DNA Sequencer, Sequence Detection System, and Thermacycler models.

The manufacturer, Applied Biosystems, has service engineers with the highest qualification for repairing the AB instrument systems. They are specially trained on the latest models of the instrument and instrument software. Applied Biosystems holds multiple patents on these instruments and is the sole source of most of the replacement parts and reagents. Parts of these instruments require special handling which requires the approval of Applied Biosystems to get any warranty replacements. 

Applied Biosystems shall provide all labor, material and equipment to provide preventive maintenance and repair service for five (5) government-owned instrument systems (1 DNA Analyzer ABI Prism 3130-16; 1 7900HT SEQUENCE DETECTION SYSTEM; 2 9700-96Well, Sample Modules; and 1 DNA Analyzer ABI Prism 3730XL located in the Laboratory of Population Genetics:1) one (1) preventive maintenance inspection; 2) unlimited emergency repair within forty-eight (48) hours of first call; 3) furnish all required replacement parts with the exception of consumable parts at no additional cost to the Government; 4) provide free software upgrades. 5) contractor personnel shall have a minimum of three (3) years specialized factory training within the last five (5) years in order to perform service to these instruments and all primary service personnel shall have at least one backup support person with at least the same level of expertise on the equipment covered by this contract.6) contractor shall provide current software updates to the operating system and shall provide Applied Biosystems parts and accessories if required during service.

It is critical to the continued smooth operation and research of the NCI/CCR that these instrument systems continue to be serviced and maintained according to the manufacturers specifications. Any deviation from the specifications could jeopardize the use of the aforementioned systems and/or the accuracy of the data generated by the systems.   The internal components and mechanisms of these instrument systems are proprietary and Applied Biosystems is the only known source capable of fulfilling the service contract on these instruments. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on February 9, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Ashley Virts, Contract Specialist at virtsa@mail.nih.gov.  It is the vendors responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Part 1: Background Information and Description of Requirements:

The Carcinogen-DNA Interactions Section investigates both the extent of DNA adduct formation and persistence, and the biological consequences of DNA damage.  NCI will utilize experimental models and human subjects, with the intention of applying the knowledge gained to elucidate mechanisms of cancer causation and approaches to cancer prevention in humans.         

The Carcinogen-DNA Interactions (CDI) section requires an imaging system that allows the quantitive analysis of immunohistochemical staining in various organelles to correlate human carcinogen exposure with cancer risk.  The Laboratory of Cellular Carcinogenesis and Tumor Promotion is currently finishing up studies of DNA adduct formation in human endometrium and human placenta to be completed and written and/or published in about a year.  There is no other instrument available that will allow the access to both current and past data. The rental of the ACIS II system is the only way to keep previous information from being lost. The laboratory absolutely requires this instrument to complete and publish ongoing studies.

Part II   Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition 

1          Statute:  This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers   may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.  

Justification:

The Carcinogen-DNA Interactions (CDI) Section is currently involved in several studies that are focused on determining the contribution of DNA adduct formation to human cancer risk in human populations where elevated cancer rates are considered associated with particular chemical exposures. As these studies are prospective and involve large numbers of human samples, paraffin-embedded samples are the only useful, and available source of human tissue for DNA adduct analysis. The ChromaVision ACIS II allows the lab to obtain semi-quantitative values for DNA adduct levels of tamoxifen and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in nuclei of paraffin-embedded and stained tissues. This is a unique resource that ultimately has the potential to provide important insights into human cancer risk and chemoprevention. Collaborations between Epidemiologists within NCI-DCEG and in extramural institutions are pertinent in the mission of the NCI and the Laboratory of Cellular Carcinogenesis and Tumor Promotion to continue the aforementioned studies.

<DESC>This procurement will result in the award of up to four Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design-Build contracts to successful 8(a) contractors.  The work will primarily consist of Design-Build, Construction Contracts for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) roofing, demolition, repair of facilities and infrastructure including but not limited to: 1) barracks and personnel housing facilities, 2) administrative facilities, 3) warehouses and supply facilities, 4) medical and dental facilities; 5) abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including but not limited to asbestos, lead paint and PCBs); 6) the civil, sanitary, stormwater, mechanical and electrical systems  for the Area of Responsibility(AOR) of PWD Midsouth Contracting Office, NSA Mid-South, Millington, TN.  This Area Includes But Is Not Limited To: Naval Suppport Activity Mid-South, Millington, TN and Large Cavitation Channel, Presidents Island, Memphis TN.  

The estimated value for all contracts is $10 million.  Each contract will be for one base year and four option years.  The anticipated range for each task order is between $650,000 and $5,000,000.  This range is for information only and may vary.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.   

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase of up to 4 offerors (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, and Management Approach.  Phase I design-build factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including new construction, roofing, demolition, routine renovation and repair of facilities and infrastructure, not just the seed project to be identified in Phase II RFP.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed to Phase II.  

In Phase II, the selected Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals for the seed project.  Offerors who fail to submit their Phase II technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution for the seed project, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality requirements of construction.  Price proposals may include total price evaluation or evaluation of scope/design options, within the Governments published budget for award. The best value offeror will receive a contract for the seed project and the best value offerors will receive minimum guarantees. Up to four IDIQ design-build contracts will be awarded for a maximum five year term.  If there is more than one seed project, the offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $31M.
    
After award of the initial contracts, the successful offerors will compete for task orders based on either Best Value to the Government or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.  Proposers will be required to submit a bid bond for the seed project and for each task order.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders.  Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  The task order statements of work may be written based on a Government/Contractor Team cooperative scoping of the work. Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may require incorporation of sustainable design features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one or more of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f! irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI), or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" may be used in this RFI, your response will be as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This RFI is issued for the purpose gaining knowledge of Hub zone firms that possess the expertise, capabilities, facilities, and experience to perform Risk Assessment at various Superfund sites in Region 8.  The EPA may require assistance to provide risk assessment support through improved management and access of its data, information, and record data both within and outside of the Agency. 

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

This announcement is for market research and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP). Essentially, it is expected that in the follow-on procurement strategy, the Government will be looking at offeror(s) that would offer the "best overall value" to the Government, not necessarily the lowest procurement cost. However, affordability will be a crucial factor.   ONLY Hub Zone firms should respond to this announcement.

The mission of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to protect public health and the environment as mandated under a variety of federal statutes including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Superfund, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act.  As such, the EPA has responsibility for improving and preserving the quality of the environment, both national and global.  This includes protection of human health and the productivity of natural resources on which all human activity depends. 

The EPA implements and enforces Federal environmental laws and U.S. policy, both foreign and domestic, which fosters integration of economic development and environmental protection so that economic growth can be sustained over the long term.  The EPA also takes steps to reduce environmental risk, educate the public on environmental issues, conservation, and prevention, as well as participating in public and private decisions affecting energy, transportation, agriculture, industry, international trade, and natural resources to ensure fully integrated consideration of environmental quality issues.  


Any result solicitation and/or subsequent contract will be accomplished under FAR Part 12, Commercial Items, and will most likely be exempt from the Service Contract Act.  The period of performance for any potential contract will be from date of award through June 13, 2011.  An issue date for soliciting has not been established at this time.

<a href="mailto:alan.chisholm@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Natick</a>
<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command, Special Operations Forces Special Projects Team is seeking information on the following:  High noise communications headset suite.  The suite should have the following mandatory characteristics:<BR><BR>a.	The System shall contain a circum-aural high noise headset, inner aural (ear bud type) high noise system, and two systems for use in low noise (provides no hearing protection) environments.  One low noise headset will be for use in a maritime environment (the 66 foot diveable version) and one headset should be a low noise ear bud for use in operations that require a less overt appearance.  <BR>b.	All headsets shall work off of a single PTT and cabling system.<BR>c.	The system shall be able to simultaneously monitor and selectively transmit on two radios and an ICS system.  <BR>d.	ICS system plug-ins shall have a quick disconnect capability. <BR>e.	The high noise headsets shall monitor multiple radio nets one per each ear with the primary in the left.<BR>f.	When the high noise headsets monitor one net it shall be heard in both ears.<BR>g.	If active noise reduction (ANR) is used in the high noise systems the wearer shall be able to readily and selectively turn on and off ANR on the spot without additional software or computers.<BR>h.	High noise systems shall provide for listen and talk capabilities in a high noise environment to include passive sound attenuation to protect the wearer from both steady state and impulse noise, while allowing the user to hear ambient ear-safe noises that he would hear with the naked ear. <BR>i.	Noise attenuation amplification shall encompass a range of audio levels (low & high) adjustable by the wearer.<BR>j.	Wearer shall be able to readily and selectively turn on and off the noise attenuation capability.<BR>k.	System shall not interfere with wearing and use of the MICH/ACH helmet when worn with the Ops-Core H chinstrap and Team Wendy pads in the SOCOM configuration with the Special Operations Eyewear Suite.  System shall not interfere with the cheek to stock weld on the M-4 weapons system with SOPMOD kit.  <BR>l.	System shall work for all SOF operators, left and right hand shooters.<BR>m.	The suite shall be compatible and functional with the 117F,  VIC 3,  PRC 148,  and the PSC 5.<BR>n.	All inner aural high noise systems shall have a non-custom molded ear bud.<BR>o.	All headsets shall maximize volume out put with a high degree of clarity.<BR>p.	All headsets shall work off of a single PTT and cabling system.<BR>q.	Offerors shall provide NRR ratings from an independent third party on all high noise products in accordance with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard S12.6-1997. <BR>r.	Inneraural high noise systems shall provide a minimum NRR rating of 22<BR>s.	Circumaural high noise systems shall provide a minimum NRR rating of 13<BR>t.

The entire system shall be Waterproof to 3 feet salt water for 30 minutes in its as worn configuration. <BR>2.	The low noise system (headset, common push-to-talk, and common applicable cabling) shall be dive able to 66 feet salt water for 3 hours, easily configurable to the wearer while submerged, secure in configuration and operable upon wearer surfacing.  Minimal degradation to headset speaker clarity and microphone sensitivity due to depth time requirement.  This is only in reference to one of the two low noise headsets.<BR>a.	The low noise headset should allow for listen and talk in low noise environments with an unobtrusive microphone and speaker system that minimizes interference with acoustic hearing, peripheral vision, and/or other worn equipment.  Speaker clarity is a critical feature in low noise environments to ensure clear receipt of communiqu without requiring a high volume level and risking compromise.  Microphone sensitivity is a critical feature in a low noise environment to ensure clear transmits of communiqu without requiring a high speech level and risking compromise.<BR>b.	The system is desired to have inner aural and circum-aural high noise headsets that are interoperable.  Interoperability is determined by the ability of each headset to enhance the others organic capabilities.  Worn simultaneously to provide higher levels of hearing protection.  <BR>c.	It is desired to have the entire system waterproof to 3 feet of salt water continuously.<BR>d.	The wearer must be able to selectively select whether to receive multi nets or a single net in mono or stereo <BR>e.

When ICS communications are required regardless of ICS system or platform user does not require the host platform to go hot, allowing the user to plug directly into the ICS system and talk over an open microphone, or use his, and not the platforms PTT to communicate. <BR>g.	The circumaural high noise headset noise pass through capabilities are independent from the communications interface with the intent that a critical failure in either area does not effect essential performance in the other.<BR>h.	The high noise circum-aural headset should be able to be worn/integrate with the MICH/ACH after the wearer has secured his helmet (e.g. The wearer not having to put on the headset prior to putting on his helmet.)<BR>i.	The system may  have compatibility with following radios: AN/PRC-148(V)1(C) MBITR  Maritime, JEM (PRC-148), AN/PSC-5D, AN/PRC117F, PRR,  AN/PRC 150, CSEL AN/PRQ-7, AN/PRC117D(V)2(C), AN/PRC-148(V)2(C) MBITR  Urban,   AN/PSC-5C,   AN-PRC-113<BR>j.	The system may have compatibility with the following ground mobility vehicles: RG 33, Stryker vehicle, and the FMTV.<BR>k.	The compatibility with ICS and Radio systems may be achieved with the minimum number of components.<BR>l.	When ICS communications are required regardless of ICS system or platform user does not require the host platform to go hot.<BR>m.	Systems that have the ability to upgrade to custom fit inner aural headset.  In either being a moldable or a fixed molded system the electronics shall be detachable/recoverable.<BR>n.	Systems are desirable that have an operationally effective wireless PTT option.  If no wireless PTT is available, a PTT that will accept the integration of another PTT (e.g. finger PTT).<BR>o.	Comfort time frame is 12 hours while still being able to secure the headset to the wearer and adjust sizing as required.<BR>p.	It is also desirable to provide amplification of ambient sounds. <BR>q.	Multiple components may be necessary to accomplish this objective, but fewer components with more capabilities are desirable.<BR>r.	Vendor submissions must perform consistently in all standard Special Operations Forces operating environments. It must be built to withstand arduous combat conditions for not less than 120 days in austere locations in all environments. The headsets will be employed in the jungle environment and experience many days of high humidity, rain, water submersion, thorny trees and bushes etc. In the Desert environment the headset will endure solar radiation, sand storms and dust, high temperatures and rocky terrain. The Maritime environment brings salt water and spray, solar, sand, and grit.  Mountainous environments bring jagged rocks, hauling and rappelling, climbing harnesses etc.  The headsets will be jumped from high altitudes, loaded in vehicles or on aircraft pallets for transport, used around sharp objects, subjected to vibration wear and tear, dropped from heights of 15 feet, beat up and down, exposed to significant wear and tear, yet have to perform to high standards in the face of combat.  Headset should be able to survive temperatures from -40F to 160F.  It is advised to have a system capable of surviving 200v/m.  System should function in all SOF RF environments.<BR>s.	Military standard or commercially equivalent batteries will power components.  A threshold battery life of 200 hours is required given a 7/1 receive to transmit ratio.

<CONTACT>Linda B Dearing, Request for Information by the U.S. Coast Guard for Proven Cutter Boat Designs, Phone (202) 475-3204, Fax (202) 475-3905, Email linda.b.dearing@uscg.mil
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Contract Operations in support of the Cutter Boat Over-The-Horizon Project Office as a means of conducting market research regarding the state of the market for two (Large and Medium) cutter boat designs. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or as an obligation or intent by the USCG to acquire any products and/or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract as a result of this RFI or otherwise pay for the requested information. The purpose of this RFI is to collect available market information that will be used to assist the USCG in evaluating its options related to its urgent need for cutter boat capability.

This RFI seeks principal cutter boat design particulars and operational features on vessels that are or are not currently in operation and have the potential to meet USCG requirements. Furthermore, these vessels shall meet the USCG requirements with or without significant development (e.g. integrate with parent cutter design). Information submitted must be based on: 1) proven currently in-service vessels that are capable of being built in the United States (US); 2) service vessels that are capable of being licensed for building in the US; or, 3) building a variant of the vessel capable of being licensed in the US. New and unproven (not in service) designs are of interest in this request and will be reviewed. The Cutter boats missions will generally occur in both littoral (coastal) and deep water (beyond 50 nautical miles from shore) and performing the following missions: Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security (PWCS), Search and Rescue (SAR), Drug Interdiction (DRUG), Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations (AMIO), Living Marine Resources (LMR), Defense Readiness (DR) and Other Law Enforcement (OLE). When deployed, operations will generally take place 12 nautical miles or more beyond U.S. shores. However, the parent cutter shall transit and operate for limited periods of time throughout inland defined harbors, canals, or waterways navigable by seagoing vessels. Recognizing that proven designs may not meet all the desired requirements listed in section I of the below listed requirements or that proven designs could possibly be modified to meet the requirements listed below, proven designs within or near the range of characteristics identified in section I of the below listed requirements may be submitted for consideration. The information requested is intended to include, but not be limited to, engineering and operational design details, boat developmental history, operational history, user contacts and other information that would be helpful for making programmatic decisions. Specifically, the requested minimum and desired information is listed in section II of the below listed requirements. Any restrictive markings included on the data shall be clearly marked. In responding to this request, data and information (drawings, documents, tables, graphs, etc.) may be submitted in different formats and media (paper or electronic files). Costs associated with returning information shall be incurred by the provider of such information. Industry is advised that Governments support contractors (D & P, Whitney, Bradley & Brown Inc, DGIT, ARL, CACI, Analytical Research, EIS and BIG) will be involved with the review of submitted information. If a Government support contractor other than those listed above will be involved with the review of submitted information, each vendor that has responded to this RFI will be notified before their information is provided to the support contractor for review. All Government support contractors required to review the information will be required to submit non-disclosure or confidentiality statements. Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever. The USCG understands that any pricing information submitted under this RFI is an estimate only and is not binding nor constitute a proposal. Responses to this RFI can be submitted to Mrs. Linda Dearing via email (linda.b.dearing@uscg.mil) or hard copy mail no more than 45 days after the RFIs posting in FedBizOpps. Responses received more than 45 days after the RFIs posting in FedBizOpps may not be afforded a comprehensive review. Responses shall state if interested in design for the CB-OTH-MK V, CB-OTH-MK IV or both cutter boats, the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. 

NOTE: Industrial Day will take place following the 45 days posting of this RFI, the date has yet to be determined for Industrial Day.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY FOR PURPOSES OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.Background:The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is responsible for establishing and maintaining a national standardized Utilization Management (UM) program (VHA Directive 2005-040) for its 21 healthcare networks (VISNs), 153 hospitals, 752 community and facility based outpatient clinics, and 135 nursing homes.  UM includes Utilization Review (UR activities) such as admission and continued stay reviews.  This program is to provide consistent UM policy and national appropriateness data that will be analyzed, reported, and used for ongoing quality improvement initiatives.  UM represents the overall program used to increase efficiency of resource use and appropriateness with which services are provided.  Through the UM program, the VHA seeks to prevent both under and over utilization of services and resources.The current UM program targets inpatient utilization; however, it is anticipated that the UM program will extend to include other levels of care and care delivery sites.  VHA is moving from a decentralized, predominantly inpatient UM program to a national standardized inpatient/outpatient program.  Presently, only a portion of acute care and behavioral health admissions and continued stays are reviewed.  VHA's goal is to complete  reviews on 100% of admissions and continued stay reviews for these patients and further expand the review process to include the outpatient setting.  Lastly, UM  reviewers are currently completing and documenting reviews manually or using locally developed software.  In 2009, we will transition to a web-based application which will be used in all VHA facilities to access utilization criteria, document review outcomes, and report utilization statistics locally. Requirements:VHA currently contracts with an external organization to license UR criteria and to obtain education and training programs for VHA reviewers.  In order to prepare a comprehensive Request for Proposal for a new contract beginning January 1, 2010, the VHA is issuing this Request for Information.  The goal of this Request for Information process is to solicit Capability Statements that VHA will use to identify potential contractors and to refine the contract criteria that will be described in the Request for Proposal.  VHA requires a potential Contractor that can provide, at a minimum, the services/capabilities listed below. Additional services and capabilities that the Contractor believes would be relevant and beneficial to include in the VHA program should be described in the Capability Statement.  Minimum contract requirements are:1. The contractor must be capable of providing a system to assess appropriateness of clinical services in a complex nationwide healthcare system of 153 medical centers.  The system will include licensing agreements for evidence-based utilization review (UR) criteria sets that are updated regularly to reflect current standards of care.  The sets are to be used in assessing medical necessity and appropriateness of clinical services.  The UR criteria must address the full continuum of clinical services, spanning across inpatient, outpatient and specialty services (e.g., surgery, imaging, behavioral health, etc.)  The contractor must have the resources and expertise to provide education and training to ensure that utilization reviewers understand the criteria and how it is applied.  The ability to customize these services and materials for the needs of the VHA is a critical component of the education and training capabilities.2. Four major elements  intertwine to provide a reliable, valid, and nationally accepted VHA Utilization Review program: (1) electronic tools and written  manuals (corporate license agreement); (2)  the ability to integrate the contractor's utilization criteria application into the current software application, the National Utilization Management Integration (NUMI) system and to provide technical support to VHA IT programming staff and UM reviewers; (3) reporting capability to enable VHA to track contractor services received, problems as they occur, and customer support services provided (4) utilization review criteria (must be available in both print and automated format), initial and on-going education, computer based training and consultation for end-users that is compatible with VA Learning Management System (LMS) software, a customized Inter Rater reliability tool,  technical support for the online criteria application, and customer support to provide guidance in the clinical application of the utilization criteria. 3. The contractor will demonstrate expertise and experience with evidence-based medicine and current literature, utilization management principles, quality management concepts, and other healthcare management and efficiency strategies.Note:  Underlying all of the contract requirements is a very strong expectation of data security and maintenance of patient confidentiality that meets or exceeds VA requirements.Interested vendors may submit their capabilities and qualifications to provide the identified services via email to Priscilla Lee at Priscilla.Lee@va.gov no later than 4:00 PM EST, February 13, 2009.  Vendors are asked to provide three relevant past performance references for the capabilities identified.  Include the Project title, Description of the project, Contract number, Contract amount, Government Agency/Organization and Point of Contact name, phone number, and email address.  If the interested vendor holds a current GSA contract, please identify Schedule and Contract number.  Telephone inquiries will NOT be accepted.  In addition to the provision of Capabilities Statements, an Industry Day(s) will be held to provide interested vendors a forum to expand on their capabilities in a direct conversation with Government officials.  All vendors interested in participating in Industry Day shall contact Priscilla Lee starting on February 17, 2009 to schedule an appointment.  Industry Day(s) will be held starting February 23, 2009.  It is anticipated that each appointment will be 45 minutes to an hour in length and will be held at a VA facility in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area.  All correspondence shall be sent via email to both addresses identified and shall reference the RFI number (VA-101-09-RI-0064) and title in the subject line.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture  Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) anticipates a sole-source (name brand) procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the following requirement:  Chalcosan brand lures to detect exotic wood boring insects.

The USDA-APHIS-PPQ Forest Wood Boring Pests Monitoring program uses an elimination grid that relies on Chalcosan brand lures and has been proven effective at detecting exotic wood boring pests.  Without this lure it will be difficult to maintain an effective survey to monitor the presence or absence of any wood boring insects within a specific area.  Failure to detect wood boring pests would seriously compromise the integrity of the eradication effort and could ultimately add to its overall cost or prevent its successful completion.

Pheronova AG of Zurich, Switzerland is the only manufacturer of this lure. The Chalcosan brand lure is distributed in the United States by El Tech Technology of Larchmont, NY.

The USDA anticipates a five-year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract worth approximately $9,000.00 per year.

Interested sources that are capable of providing the equivalent supply listed above are encouraged to submit statements of capability to the contracting office.  Small business concerns are encouraged to participate.  This is not a request for competitive proposals, but instead a market research method to determine interested sources.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive (i.e., non-brand name) procurement.  Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  Please provide past performance and references regarding your ability to provide this supply and service along with your Statement of Capability.   The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide.  Information provided is strictly voluntary.

<DESC>The Department of Education intends to issue a 3 month (90 days) extension to existing contract # ED-01-CO-0028/0019.  The current period of performance ends on March 24, 2009.  The purpose of the extension is to enable AIR staff provide a report for NAEP Mapping 2007 study that is signed-off by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). 

On September 25, 2003, The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) awarded contract ED-01-CO-0026/0019 to American Institute for Research (AIR) with head office at Washington, DC seeking technical and analytical support necessary to design, conduct, and report in-depth, thematic studies of student achievement within the states, jurisdictions, and districts participating in NAEP. The ultimate goal was to enrich the scope of state NAEP results by conducting ad-hoc and exploratory analyses on the existing and forthcoming assessment results.
 
The tasks under this project classified into four activities. One activity was to compile available information on state assessments. So the data can be used in comparing the state performances along with NAEP state assessments and produce report; for example, NAEP Mapping study, measuring improvement in inclusion rates of special students in NAEP assessment. The mode of data collection has to be changed at the request of the states and caused the initial delays. Other unavoidable circumstances led AIR delay in completing the various stages of reviews, a requirement for NCES products.   

The 3 month (90 day) extension will allow AIR to complete the reports on NAEP 2007 mapping study satisfactory to all three stages of reviews that includes IES to sign-off. This will allow the resulting report to be publicly released in accordance with IES policies.
This notice is for informational purposes only.  A request for proposal is not required.  Interested parties may, however, request further information no later than February 13, 2009 by email to Contract Specialist Vidya Vish at Vidya.Vish@ed.gov.

In support of this mission and activities, DTRA anticipates issuing several solicitations for research over the next five (5) years.  These solicitations are generally released using Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs), Service Calls, and/or Requests for Proposals (RFPs).

DTRA requires a vendor to: 
- Develop, host, maintain, and manage a web-based capability to support end-to-end management processes.

(4) System Maintenance  System availability to be maintained at 95%. Help desk operations required to support users 18/7.

(5) Archiving of Data  Starting with Government Furnished Information dating back to FY07 and continuing the archiving for subsequent years.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with IBM Company of Bethesda, Maryland to provide an additional year, October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012, of service of the existing high performance computing (HPC) system being leased by NOAA/NWS/NCEP under contract DG133W-02-CN-0013. The HPC system is located in IBM's Business Continuity and Recovery Services facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland and in NASA's Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) facility in Fairmont, West Virginia. This synopsis serves to notify the public of the proposed contract action.</p>
<p>The Government intends to modify the existing contract to acquire an additional year of processing capability, storage, networking, software, services and facility housing/services in support of operational activities associated with the Weather and Climate Supercomputing program. The existing HPC system was designed by IBM to provide a balanced supercomputing environment that includes not only large-scale computing but disk storage and tape storage associated with both operational clusters and infrastructure to access existing data archives. The current system consists of two operational supercomputer clusters, Mist and Dew, with identical configuration, a 16-node p575 cluster for special projects and a 4-node p575 Test and Evaluation cluster. Each operational system is an IBM p575 cluster employing 2368 Power5+ processors with 2GB memory per processor and 160 TB disk on each system. Under the contract IBM is scheduled to replace these two systems with two Power6-based systems capable of delivering improved performance during FY 2009. The Power6 systems will deliver 2.5 times the capability processing and 3.7 times the capacity processing, with respect to the Power5+ systems, as measured by NCEP benchmark codes. These systems employ two IBM TS3500 tape libraries via TSM archival software and network infrastructure. IBM also provides system administration and other system related support services under the contract. IBM also provides a facility that houses one of these systems (Mist); including charges for all utilities, Uninterruptible Power Supply, backup electrical generators (sufficient to provide "N+1" redundancy), all associated facility infrastructure (such as electrical switch gear, water-cooling plumbing, etc.) and 7X24X365 support sufficient to meet NCEP's on-time requirements. The HPC system currently utilized by NCEP directly supports NOAA's strategic goals in Climate and Weather and Water by enabling its research into the physical processes governing the Earth's weather, climate and ocean.</p>
<p>The HPC system must provide a continuation of operational performance at least equivalent to Mist and Dew, including support of the IBM GPFS parallel filesystem and meet NCEP's current dependability standard of 99% operational use time and 99% on-time product generation guarantee. The HPC system must be fully supported by system administrators and maintenance provided on a 7X24 basis. The HPC system must continue to support full integration with the existing tape archival system. In addition, the HPC systems must be integrated into NCEP's local area network and NCEP's wide area network, supported by industry standard communications hardware/software. Both Verizon and Quest have points of presence within the Gaithersburg and Fairmont facilities.</p>
<p>The estimated budget for the additional year of system and facility utilization is approximately $11.1 Million. NOAA anticipates leasing the hardware and software and purchasing services under fixed-price terms. One year maintenance (7X24) and support services must be included in the acquisition. Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates and ability to furnish a production-ready system capable of meeting the previously cited requirements and a facility to support that system. Seamless integration of the HPC system into the existing infrastructure is required. Of particular concern to the Government is accomplishment of system integration with zero disruption of NCEP's operational Weather and Climate forecasting activities. Vendors must include in their response an explanation, in detail, of its plan to implement and manage integration with the existing HPC and communications systems. All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion. Affirmative responses must be received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis.</p>

<p>Notice of Contractor Personnel Security Requirements<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) (See Note I) entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I. (1) Long-Term Contractor Personnel:<br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term (See Note ii) contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:(a) Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />(b) Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />&copy; Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />-- High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />-- Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />-- Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />(d) The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:<br />(1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;<br />(2) Favorable fingerprint results;<br />(3) Favorable credit report, if required; (See Note iii)<br />(4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and<br />(5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) (See Note iv) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). (e) Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the FBI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.<br />(2) Short-Term Contractor Personnel:<br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a.and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:<br />(a) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;<br />(b) Favorable fingerprint results;<br />&copy; Favorable credit report, if required; (See Note v) and<br />(d) Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.<br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.<br />(3) Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.<br />(a) For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.<br />(b) Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.<br />&copy; Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.<br />(d) If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge.

Reference the following links for additional information:<br />Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch in 5 CFR Part 2635: <br />2002 CFR Title 5, Volume 3<br />Conflict of Interest laws in Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States Code: <br />Title 18 United States Code<br />Financial Disclosure requirements in 5 CFR Part 2634: http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/5cfr2634_05.html<br />The Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution (See Sec. 9, Clause 8): http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html <br />3 FAM 4120 (Employee Responsibilities Abroad): <br />http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/85177.pdf<br />e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical<br />1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.<br />2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. The Government will reimburse the cost of medevac insurance premiums. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).<br />3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.<br />(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.<br />(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.<br />f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.<br />g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.<br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.<br />3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimburseable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.<br />4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so, and based on medical opinion, contractor is fit to return to duty.<br />.<br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. Such authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.<br />5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not also a U.S. holiday.<br />6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.<br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.<br />A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.<br />Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.<br />8) Passport<br />All passports must be valid for the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.<br />h.

Insurance<br />1) Worker's Compensation Benefits<br />The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.<br />2) Health and Life Insurance.<br />a) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 75% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, excluding costs for private medical evacuation (medevac) insurance, if any, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.<br />b) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 33 1/3% against the actual costs of annual basic life insurance coverage on the same basis as the U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program. Basic life insurance coverage is defined as coverage up to an amount equal to the contractor's annual basic salary rounded up to the next even $1,000 plus $2,000.<br />c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide coverage or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under paragraphs i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.<br />d) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.<br />e) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health and/or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under i. Insurance 1) and/or 2), respectively, of this provision.<br />3) Medevac Coverage<br />a) U.S. Citizens: U.S. citizens who meet the medical clearance requirements are furnished medical evacuation service at no cost.<br />b) Non U.S. citizens do not qualify for government furnished medical evacuation service at no cost and thus will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance. CDC shall reimburse 100% of the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance maintained by the contractor. CDC does not require that contractor obtain coverage from any one specific company. The contractor is responsible for and has the discretion to choose a provider. For information purposes only: The Department of State maintains a list of U.S. based providers on the following website: <br />http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/brochures/brochures_1215.html<br />CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance. CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract. After receipt of an offer letter, the contractor shall furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance and its cost, for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders, in order for CDC to reimburse the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance.<br />j.

A Personal Services Contractor Evaluation Form will be used and will be provided after contract award. Awarding of any contract extension shall be contingent upon receipt of an evaluation reflecting at least a satisfactory (acceptable, passing) level of performance under the contract during the previous 12 months of service. The reviews shall be scheduled and coordinated with the CDC Field Supervisor. The Field Supervisor shall provide the PSC employee with the appropriate performance standards for this position.<br />k.

The following factors and sub-factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Factor 1: Technical Acceptability. Four (4) sub-factors establish the requirements of the acceptability set forth in the combined synopsis/solicitation, RFQ and Statement of Work. Each sub-factor is equally important. Failure to meet a requirement will result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.<br />a. Sub-factor 1: Ability to clean 95,000 square feet of carpet within a two week period. The offeror shall demonstrate what procedures will be used to complete the work in the designated time frame.<br />b. Sub-factor 2: Usage of low moisture shampoo. The offeror shall demonstrate how to successfully remove all spots, stains and gum; while preventing damage to wires located near or under raised floors.<br />c. Sub-factor 3: Drying process. The offeror shall demonstrate the ability to have all carpet areas completely dry within 30 minutes with no residue.<br />d. Sub-factor 4: Site Visit.

All references shall fill out the attached Past Performance Questionnaire and send directly back to AFDW Contracting Office. This form is not to come from the offeror.<br />3. Factor 3: Price. An offeror's proposed price will be determined by multiplying the estimated quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the unit price for each item for the period of performance.

If there is no charge for an identified requirement, "NO CHARGE" or "n/c" must be placed in the appropriate location on the Pricing Schedule and the contractor shall be committed to providing that service at no additional cost to the Government. Non-priced requirements shall be considered incomplete and may render the proposal unacceptable.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest offeror. Technical and past performance, when combined shall be considered highly more important than pricing.</p>
<p>b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise that option(s).</p>

<DESC>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Lakewood, CO, has a requirement for a commercial item or service.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.603 (as supplemented with additional information included in this notice) on a sole source basis.  This posting will be referred to under Purchase Requisition Number 601819Q214.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  A written solicitation will not be issued.  This RFQ falls under procedures in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  This document incorporates provisions and clauses updated by way of the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26, effective June 12, 2008.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) number is 541712, Food research and development laboratories or services (except biotechnology research and development), with a business size standard of 500 employees.  This announcement constitutes the Government's only official notice of this procurement.
Based on the information at this time, the Government considers the commodity specified as a sole source requirement from Food Source Lure Corporation and proposes to negotiate a contract with this firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  
FWS' salient characteristics that will satisfy the Government's needs for its requirement for Prairie Dog Bait Testing are:
-  Development and testing of oral baits for delivery of plague vaccine to prairie dogs.  All laboratory experiments will be conducted at the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC), Madison, Wisconsin.  Field testing activities will be located at on Fort Carson Military Reservation (FCMR) in the vicinity of TA-54.  Lab baits must be available for Laboratory testing by 15 March 2009.  FCMR baits must be available for field testing by 15 May 2009.  
-  In order to allow the FWS to reintroduce black-footed ferrets throughout their former range, the USGS National Wildlife Health Center has developed a method to immunize prairie dogs with an oral plague vaccine that uses pox virus to produce an immune response to plague bacteria.  To date, USFS research has shown that the only medium that will hold the live oral vaccine for up to four weeks, is the proprietary bait formula produced by the Food Source Lure Corporation.  In addition, their vaccine/bait medium is biodegradable and environmentally safe, and has already been demonstrated to be palatable to prairie dogs.  
	-  Laboratory Testing:  Twelve different bait candidates (4 flavors x 3 textures including unscented) will be tested for their palatability in prairie dogs.  The baits will be presented to groups of prairie dogs in a laboratory setting to determine the preferred flavor and texture.   Once the most preferred bait is determined, a powder formulation will be mixed with a vaccine preparation and a biomarker (e.g. Rhodamine B) in order to evaluate stability and duration of the vaccine-laden bait at different temperatures.   Vaccine-laden baits will be held at 3 different temperatures and sampled weekly up to 4 weeks to evaluate vaccine titer.

Geographical Coverage: There are no points associated with this factor. However, quoters may attribute further consideration for availability in the following geographic areas: 1. Limited Areas, 2. Under-Served Areas, and 3. All Areas. Purchase Card: Additional consideration will be given to a quoter that accepts a purchase card as a method of payment. 

Pricing: EEOC will not request a price quote from quoters under this RFQ, because the unit price of $800.00 has been established for each mediation case requirement.  The Government will not evaluate price under this RFQ.  Therefore, pricing information will not be accepted or considered.

EEOC technical evaluator(s) will rank the quoter (firm) considered to be the most highly qualified in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in this RFQ, in order of preference.  Award will be made to the highest technically rated quotation(s).  The award of multiple Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts is contemplated.

The Government reserves the right to evaluate quotations and make contract award(s) without discussions with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, quoters must submit their most favorable terms from a technical standpoint.  The evaluation of the quotations shall be within the sole judgement and discretion of the EEOC. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  Contract award(s) will be based on the evaluation factors listed in this RFQ. 

Applicable Provisions and Clauses: The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

<a href="mailto:ashley.taylor@amedd.army.mil">European Regional Contracting Office</a>
<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Europe Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 44 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the countries Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Casting Supplies-Padding in all sizes as detailed in the technical criteria below.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program. <BR><BR>The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Health Center Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health and Birthing Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, and U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella.<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process: vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II; where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and/or samples.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PV for the Europe Region (Owens and Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program.  This RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding the DSCP PV program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<BR><BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR><BR>B.	Products and Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Casting Supplies-Padding, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $111,635.08.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.  The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final selection recommendation will be determined by utilizing the best value and trade off criteria.  <BR><BR>At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of these products, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) information, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative MUST E-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  Your e-mail will include your agreement to provide for your products necessary technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers that represent a discount from your companies base uncommitted DAPA pricing.  Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative. The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain their best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the best tiered-pricing discounts off of the company DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process: Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendor responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendor information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.<BR><BR>The following eight (8) equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative and vendors MUST provide a response to the following criteria by the closing date of the FBO:<BR>1.	Vendors must be able to provide a full product line of Casting Supplies-Padding to include but not limited to cotton, sterile and non-sterile forms that are used in all patient care settings in the Europe Region military treatment facilities (MTF).  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined for this report as items used in the Europe Theater within a twelve month period.  At a minimum, a complete product line includes:<BR>	a. Usage items:	<BR>1)	Padding Cast or Splint Cotton Sterile-Sizes: 2, 3, and 4inW x 4yds.<BR>2)	Padding Cast or Splint Cotton-Sizes: 2, 3, and 4inW x 4yds.<BR>	b. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I. <BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Casting Supplies-Padding product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) Your DAPA number is: __________________.  <BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Prime Vendor (PV), Owens and Minor, for Casting Supplies-Padding distribution in the Europe Region.  Vendor must provide the four digit Owens and Minor code with initial submittal. (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR>4.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format within 14 days of request by the TRBO.<BR>6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for their Casting Supplies-Padding product lines including dates, duration, cause, and resolution in response to this RFQ.  Vendors will not have the opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.	Vendors must identify the types of educational tools, materials or staff training that the company provides for Casting Supplies-Padding in response to this RFQ.<BR>8.	Vendors must indicate that they agree to ship samples necessary for evaluation to the TRBO by close of business (COB) within 14 calendar days of request via United States Postal Service (USPS) eliminating delays that occur with Custom Offices in Europe.  Proof of vendor shipment (copy of the PS Form 2976-A with stamped date) via USPS prior to the established deadline must be scanned and sent via digitally signed e-mail to the TRBO.  Provide acknowledgement of this requirement in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical Evaluation Process<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the TRBO via USPS to the following APO address: Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization, Mr. Robert Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108), CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>2.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship samples for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of samples by COB on the 14th calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply samples will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send TRBO Point of Contact (POC) verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and the anticipated delivery date via e-mail digitally signed.  Verification of shipment is defined as sending the TRBO a copy of the USPS PS form 2976-A customs form.  The PS form 2976-A will have a stamped date the package was accepted by USPS.  Vendors whose packages have a stamped date after the established notification to ship deadline date will be disqualified from this standardization process.<BR>The non-sterile samples: Padding: 2, 3, and 4 inch; one (1) bag (8-12 rolls per bag) for the eight (8) MTFs 1 of each size for the TRBO to be provided as follows:<BR>1.	Padding-size: 2 inch non-sterile padding.<BR>2.	Padding-size: 3 inch non-sterile padding.<BR>3.	Padding-size: 4 inch non-sterile padding.<BR>NOTE:  Samples are to be shipped to the Europe Region TRBO.  The TRBO requests sample orders be separated by MTF.  The TRBO will have the responsibility of forwarding the samples to the participating MTFs. Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR>3.  To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>4. The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The CPT will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are:  one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.00 depending on the location of any break in vendor average scores (i.e., a gap between vendor average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  The criteria below will be evaluated one (1) time by each participating MTF.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criterion:<BR><BR>1. Material performance and Clinician preference  The cast padding readily tears allowing uniform padding application over body contours.<BR>a.	The padding must tear evenly and smoothly aiding the uniform molding process preventing unnecessary pressure against the patients skin or bony prominences promoting skin breakdown. <BR>b.	The evaluator will apply the padding to the body area that is needed observing the ability of the padding to functionally tear aiding the process to provide a smooth surface for the casting tape.<BR>2. Material performance and Clinician preference  The cast padding readily molds for a uniform application over body contours.<BR>a.   The padding must provide uniform molding so that it does not put unnecessary pressure against the patients skin or bony prominences preventing skin breakdown.<BR>b.   The evaluator will apply the padding to the body area that is needed and mold it to fit the body contour observing the ability of the padding to uniformly conform providing a smooth surface for the casting tape.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.) The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain their best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  <BR><BR>Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the CPT.  The CPT will then make a recommendation to the TPRB with the selected vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Region. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more clinically equal, price will become more important. The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: 1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements. 2) Impact of Unmatched Lines; i.e.; do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor? 3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR>Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on Fedbid.  All bids will be provided from GSA approved vendors.  It is anticipated the final award will be to the entity providing the best competitive price through the Fedbid process.  As this is a brand name justification it is supporting existing HP equipment that has reached end of life or out-of-cycle SAN that will be moved to the LAB which has no SAN.  Current SAN is 4 years old, is not expandable and has become stretched for capacity.<BR><BR>to correct Line Item 9<BR><BR>

<DESC>Questions and Answers:

Q1. Can you tell me if the NGA intends to purchase courseware that has already been developed (i.e. COTS products developed with out a specific client in mind); or, a more customized product that specifically addresses the needs of the NGA learner?

A1. The government is in market research mode at this time and doesn't know if a Request for Proposal will be issued in the future.  The government is looking to purchase both customized and standard off the shelf training depending on the subject.  Any information supplied by your company will be greatly appreciated and will aid the government in planning.

Q2.	How many users would be accessing the courses in a typical year?
A2. Estimate 20-40 per month for a total of 250-500 per year.

Q3.	Do you have your own learning management system or would you need the service provider to host the courses?
A3.The government has its own learning management system and ability to host courseware.

Q4.  How much time would your typical user have to devote to a particular course?  (An hour, two hours?)
A4. Estimates are 30-60 minutes at a time.  Short discreet lessons would be best.

<DESC><p>The National Marine Fisheries Service has a requirement to research and study hormone analogs that can be used to improve reproduction of fish raised for aquaculture or for conservation purposes. The aim of this project is to develop methods to produce gonadotropin analogs that are hybrids of hCG and fish gonadotropins and are biologically active in variety of fish species. To accomplish this goal, recombinant fish gonadotropin analogs must be tested for their ability to regulate ovarian and testicular function. The contractor must have purified native salmon FSH, LH and TSH, and immunoassays for steroids and thyroid hormones listed below to successfully complete this work. There are two tasks required for this work. In addition, all assays must be done using coho salmon or tissues from this species.
<p>1) Test up to 40 recombinant salmon gonadotropin analogs for steroidogenic activity using bioassays with coho salmon ovarian tissue. These bioassays should be done using cultures of coho salmon ovarian follicles and measuring the amount of steroid released into cell culture medium by radioimmunoassay. Three types of steroidogenic activity must be determined:<br />a. Assay the ability of analogs to stimulate in vitro production of estradiol-17 beta by vitellogenic coho salmon ovarian follicles and to compare their activities to that of purified native forms of coho salmon FSH and LH from salmon. At least 4 concentrations of each should be tested.<br />b. Assay the ability of analogs to stimulate in vitro conversion of 17-alpha hydroxy progesterone to 17-alpha, 20-beta hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one by coho salmon ovarian granulosa cells and to compare their activities to that of purified native forms of FSH and LH. Cultures of granulosa cells from preovulatory ovaries of coho salmon must be used for this assay since it specifically tests the LH activity of the preparations. Other stage ovaries cannot be used for this assay. At least 4 concentrations of each should be tested.<br />c. Assay the ability of analogs to stimulate in vitro production of 11-ketotestosterone by testicular tissue from coho salmon in early stages of spermatogenesis and to compare their activities to that of purified native forms of coho salmon FSH and LH from salmon. At least 4 concentrations of each should be tested.</p>
<p>2) Test up to 40 recombinant salmon gonadotropin analogs for thyrotropic activity using in vivo bioassays with juvenile (no greater than 20 g body weight) coho salmon. These bioassays should quantify the changes in plasma thyroxine levels after two injections of analogs (3 doses/analog) compared to purified native salmon thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and bovine TSH.</p>
<p>The Research Scientist/Engineer must have the following:<br />Education<br />1) Person overseeing the work -Ph. D. in biological sciences<br />2) Person performing the bioassays - M.S. or Ph.D. in biological sciences</p>
<p>Experience<br />1) Vendor must have experience with culturing salmon or trout ovarian<br />follicles and isolation of granulosa cells from the ovary and measuring<br />steroid production by these cells.<br />2) Vendor must have experience in staging salmon oocytes so that bioassays<br />are performed at the appropriate stage<br />3) Vendor must have experience and have reagents necessary to perform<br />radioimmunoassays or enzyme immunoassays to measure estradiol 17-beta and<br />17a, 20b-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one in culture medium. Must have ability to<br />run thyroxine immunoassays to measure blood levels of thyroid hormones.</p>
<p>Reagents-<br />The vendor must have purified native salmon gonadotropins (FSH and LH) to<br />compare activities of analogs to native hormones.</p>
<p>Period of performance is from date of award through June 30, 2010. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA) is required. NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS&nbsp;A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. An attached&nbsp;solicitation document is available.&nbsp; All interested parties must respond to this announcement by March 2, 2009.&nbsp;The Government will review each response to determine if the contractor has the experience, knowledge, and capability to perform the services as specified above. Detailed information must be submitted by email to the address noted below by 2:00 PM local Seattle time (PDT), March 2, 2009. Email Address: Mona.M.Ash@noaa.gov. Questions of any nature must be addressed in writing as NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE HONORED.</p>

The treatment method may include burning, mowing and the application of a selective herbicide such as Plateau, Garlon3A or Fusilade. Or herbaceous species control may include some combination of burning, mowing and selective, spot treatment with a broad-spectrum glyphosate-based herbicide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Site preparation for seeding, and seeding itself, will occur only in the 6.5-acre woodland portion. Site preparation will consist of 3-4 herbicide applications 6-8 weeks apart, to be followed by fall seeding. Seeding may also occur the following spring. Seed application with native woodland seed at the rate of 5 pounds per acre combined with cover crop seed at the rate of 75 pounds per acre will follow site preparation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">During the first growing season or two, mowing will be the primary management tool used to prevent weeds from excessively shading the native seedlings.

Spot treatment must be used only on cool, windless days. Overseeding will occur, if necessary, during site management and monitoring years to repair any areas where seeding was unsuccessful.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 18pt">After 2 or 3 growing seasons, most native plantings need to be burned annually for the following management and monitoring years to become well established, which produces greater diversity and better growth. The first annual prescribed burn at the flow site will occur during the spring of Site Management and Monitoring Year 3 and be followed again in Year 4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The remaining annual establishment period burns will become the responsibility of the Cook County Forest Preserve District.

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
