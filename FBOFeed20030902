The period of performance shall be for one base year and one one-year option period.

Specifically, the contractor will 1) identify the purpose of the web site for each of the four Hawaiian health organizations to include the target audience(s); the information to be included; information solicited from site visitors, and the nature of communication, if any, from site visitors, 2) execute web site development contracts for site development and for the training of the Technical Administrators for each of the four web sites, 3) assist the national Library of Medicine in developing its Pacific Islander web site by providing assistance in collecting materials and information and by reviewing drafts of the site and commenting on its contents and appropriateness.

With support from POL, the Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems promote health and disease prevention strategies and various other health services.  POL will assist NLM in obtaining much needed information, some of which is not currently in digital for NLM’s Pacific Islander Health Information web site.

This service will be procured under FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions.)  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.

A - LASER PHOTOACOUSTIC SPECTROSCOPY, SOL BAA 03-38, DUE 111003, POC LTC JOHN C. CARRANO, DARPA/MTO, FAX (703) 696-2206
  
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of laser-photoacoustic spectroscopy (L-PAS) for use as chemical and explosive agent detectors on a variety of military platforms.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in infrared lasers, photonic components, and systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  

1.  Laser Development:  This area represents the main focus for Phase I and Phase II of the program.  The interests for this area include, but are not limited to, the development and demonstration both gas lasers and semiconductor lasers operating in the IR portion of the spectrum.  To be consistent with the ultimate goals of a compact, inexpensive and reliable chemical sensor system, particular emphasis will be placed on high operating temperature continuous wave operation of the lasers over a sufficient lifetime.

2.  Optical and Photonic Component Development:  During Phase II of the program, and into Phase III, there will be emphasis on the design of the optical architecture to include all optical and/or photonic components required by the prototype sensor system.

3.  Prototype Sensor System Construction and Demonstration:  This area represents the main focus of Phase III of the program.  The design, construction, complete testing, demonstration, and final delivery of prototype L-PAS chemical sensors is a major goal for this final phase of the program.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-38 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The L-PAS program will consist of a one-year core effort followed by an optional second, third, and fourth year for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD.  Awards totaling approximately $10 million over the first year are expected to be made during the first half of fiscal year 2004.  Options totaling approximately $20 million may be awarded for the second, third, and fourth years.  Organizations wishing to participate in the second, third, and fourth years should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each year).   Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are strongly encouraged.  The program will also support some very innovative individual investigator efforts as well.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Dr. John C. Carrano, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: jcarrano@darpa.mil. 	

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 03-38, Laser Photoacoustic Spectroscopy, Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on Laser Photoacoustic Spectroscopy, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/. Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  Proposers must submit an original hard copy of the proposal abstract, six (6) hard copies and one (1) electronic copy (i.e., one disk) of the proposal (PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable each on a CD-ROM, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette). Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-38, proposer organization, and proposal title (short title recommended). The full abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-38) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Monday, September 29, 2003,  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit an original, six (6) hard copies and one (1) electronic copy (i.e., one disk) of the proposal (PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable each on a CD-ROM, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette). Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-38, proposer organization, and proposal title (short title recommended) of the full proposal to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-38) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Monday, November 10, 2003, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 03-38 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Laser Photoacoustic Spectroscopy. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 03-38.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for management and staffing of the Science and Technology Policy Institute in support of Office of Science and Technology Policy in accordance with requirements delineated below.          MANDATE AND GOVERNANCE          As reflected in U.S. Code: Title 42 USC §6686 (herein referred to as “the Act’), Congress mandated the establishment of a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) to be known as the Science and Technology Policy Institute (hereinafter in this document referred to as “the Institute”).  The Institute was established to assist the Executive Branch as it formulates federal policy involving science and technology by providing objective, high quality analytic support to inform policymakers.  The Act specified the duties of the Institute as follows:  Assemble timely and authoritative information regarding significant science and technology developments and trends in the United States and abroad.  Analyze and interpret the information referred to above, with particular attention to the scope and content of the Federal science and technology R&D portfolio as it affects interagency and national issues.  Conduct studies and analyses of alternatives available for ensuring the long-term strength of the U.S. in the development and application of science and technology, including appropriate roles for the Federal Government and other sectors.  Provide, upon request of the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), technical support and assistance for the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology (PCAST) and to committees and panels of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).  Consult widely with representatives from private industry, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit institutions and incorporate, to the extent practicable, information and perspectives derived from such consultations in carrying out its work.  Please see FAR 35.017 “Federally Funded Research and Development Centers”, for qualification and policy regulations, http://www.arnet.gov/far/.          SPONSORS’ CONCEPT OF THE INSTITUTE          NSF and OSTP  (hereinafter referred to as “the Sponsors”) conceive that the Institute will operate as follows:     *  While NSF is the primary sponsor of the Institute, OSTP should be viewed as its primary customer. In general OSTP will provide technical direction and oversight while NSF will provide business, financial and contractual oversight.     *  The Institute shall meet special research and analysis needs of is sponsors, whether short-term or long-term that cannot be met as effectively by using existing in-house or normal contractor resources. The Institute shall provide its sponsors with a network of institutional and individual sources of expertise that could not be contained within a single organization.  The Institute shall inform its sponsors and other government policymakers through the objective, independent, and high quality analysis and assembly of information, in contrast to taking advocacy positions.      *  The Institute shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special long-term relationship with the Government; i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts-of-interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its sponsors, and to serve the unique needs of its sponsors, while holding their full confidence and trust.          MANAGEMENT PLAN          The organization that is awarded the contract to operate the Institute (hereinafter referred to as the “Contractor”) shall set up, provide the necessary space and equipment, support and technical personnel to establish and manage the Institute, as an FFRDC in accordance with the Sponsors’ concept for the Institute described above.  The Contractor, through the Institute, will be responsible for planning and executing such research and analysis as the Sponsors may specify.  Such research and analysis may include quick-response, ad-hoc analysis and technical support, short-term studies (up to one month), medium-term studies (1-6 months) and long-term studies (more than six months). The Contractor will also provide staff and technical support for the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (“PCAST”) and the National Science and Technology Council (“NSTC”), as deemed necessary.  Task areas may include but are not limited to:   *National Security    *Critical Infrastructure Protection   *Health and the Environment   *Space/Transportation   *Information/Telecommunication Infrastructure and Technology   *Education/Training   *R&D Portfolio, including emerging S&T issues   *PCAST and NSTC Support   *Development of New Analytic Methods and Tools     The Contractor will be responsible for hiring a certified public accounting firm to conduct: (1) annual financial audits of the operations of the Institute (and certify annual financial statements), and (2) all audits required either under OMB circulars or under the cost principles applicable to the Institute.          TASKS FOR OTHER THAN THE SPONSORS          It is not the Government’s intent that an FFRDC use its privileged information or access to facilities to compete with the private sector.  However, an FFRDC may perform work for other than the sponsoring agency under the Economy Act, or other applicable legislation, when the work is not otherwise available from the private sector.    This is allowable, provided:      * The task is consistent with the duties and responsibilities of the Institute as specified in the Act.   * The Institute has received the prior written approval of the Sponsors.    * Funding for the projects has been transferred from the funding agency or agencies to the NSF and added to the Institute contract.   * The Institute and the sponsoring agency or agencies agree to fully disclose all aspects of the work being performed, including draft documents, to the Sponsors upon request.          ELIGIBILITY QUALIFIERS          As specified in the Act, the Institute shall be: (1) administered as a separate entity by an organization currently managing another FFRDC. Qualified organizations must possess a broad interdisciplinary staff with backgrounds pertinent to the environment in which it is expected to operate.  Qualified organizations must be able to work effectively and in a timely manner with Federal organizations, institutions and personnel in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.     Oral communications and facsimile responses are not authorized, all questions must be submitted electronically to the National Science Foundation, Attn: Jamala A. Jones, Contracting Officer, Division of Acquisition and Cost Support, at jajones@nsf.gov by April 22, 2003.  Responses will be posted on April 30, 2003.  This is not a Request for Proposal; therefore no contract will be awarded resultant of this notice.  It is anticipated that a request for proposal will be issued on or about the end of May 2003 with a proposal due date on or about the beginning of July 2003.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to award a commercial sole source purchase order to Spectra-Physics Distribution, Mountain View, CA 94039,  pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This request is for the purchase of one (1) each of the following: Stabilite 2017-AR, Model 2017-UV, 2-year Extended Warranty, Installation, and On-Site Training.  The Spectra-Physics Stabilite 2017 Argon Ion Laser is needed to replace and upgrade a malfunctioning Spectra-Physics 164 Argon Ion Laser currently in use in the lab.  This laser must  function with the Uniblitz Shutters and IR laser spotting device from Prairie Technologies.  The 2017 puts out more than 100 mW of output power in the UV range, which is required for local photolysis of the caged ligands used in the lab, with a beam diameter of less than 1.5 mm, and an optical noise of less than 0.5% rms. The resonator structure shall be of a coaxial Stabilite type utilizing the high thermal conductivity of brass in order to maintain stable beam pointing and power stability during operation.  This configuration and helical flow of the cooling water create a "thermal short" that prevents thermal gradients, the major source of angular distortion thus less detuning of the laser and the attendant need for re-optimization of the mirrors either through automatic or manual intervention.  Other capabilities include; (1) The system must be capable of computer control through an optional interface which allows both RS-232 and IEEE-488 communication, (2) a fritless Quartz-Metal seal must be used to join Brewster windows to their stem in order to eliminate contamination associated with adhesives, (3) brewster windows must be of crystalline quartz material in order to prolong UV performance and prevent color-center formation, (4) brewster windows must possess a refractive coating to prolong plasma tube lifetimes when running at high visible and ultraviolet power outputs, (5) the laser must incorporate an externally adjustable intracavity disc-wheel aperture for precise mode control (adjustable iris diaphragms are not acceptable), (6) an automatic gas fill system must be employed in order to maintain optimum gas pressure in the plasma tube without the need for manual intervention, (7) the cavity mirrors must be of the quick-change type utilizing bayonet style mounts thus allowing the user to change from single-line to multi-line operation while still maintaining lasing, (8) wavelength selective mirrors must be made available for enhanced mode-quality at high gain single wavelengths (this will allow the system to provide more effective usable power thereby allowing for system operation at lower currents to extend plasma tube and related component lifetimes), (9) the system must come complete with a full-function remote control with latching fault diagnostics, (10) the power supply shall incorporate modular Switched Resistor technology, which greatly reduces the number of transistors in the passbank to less than five (his provides an inherently more reliable design as it de-couples the requirement of the passbank resistors to both regulate electrical power and dissipate heat), (11) the power supply must stand no higher than 6 inches in order that it fit under optical tables and benches and accommodate rack mounting thus allowing for better use of laboratory floor space, (12) the power supply must have an integral EMI filter to eliminate line voltage noise, (13) the power supply must be designed in order to exceed the UL 1950 worldwide safety standard, FCC Class A and VDE 0871A conducted emissions standards, (14) the umbilical cord to the laser head must not carry any high voltage start pulses for safe operation of the system, and (15) the umbilical cord must not be able to be disconnected while the laser is operating but should be detachable for convenient relocation of the laser system. All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 10 days of date of notice to Dee Lunney at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Spetra-Physics Dist.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, USTDA 1000 Wilson Boulevard Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Cantemir Mambet, QHSE Management Director, Rompetrol S.A., Rompetrol Building, 222 Calea Victoriei, 71104 Bucharest, Romania, Phone: (40) 21 30 30 859, Fax: (40) 21 31 45 337.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study on the modernization of existing sufur recovery and sour water stripping system at Rompetrol Refining’s Petromidia oil refinery in Romania.  The modernization efforts would also include the development and operation of an integrated system for the recovery of solid sulfur and production of sulfuric acid, known as a Gas Desulfurization and Sulfur Recovery (GDSR) system.

Since Romania aspires to join the European Union (EU), it must comply with the EURO 3 regulatory standards set forth for gasoline.  Improvements to the Petromidia refinery would fulfill the required EU oil product standards.  As part of its admission requirements to enter the EU, Romania has passed legislation to lower sulfur content in fuels, and passed stringent air, water, and waste environmental regulations.  Petromidia has the capability to currently produce low sulfur fuels, however, the advent of upgraded GDSR systems will allow Petromidia to improve its throughput capability by nearly 20%, resulting in an estimated $6 million a year in addition profits.  In addition, more efficient GDSR units would allow for Petromidia to purchase cheaper high sulfur crude oil from the Caspian Sea and still comply with EU low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel standards.

Founded in 1974, Rompetrol is today the international arm of the Romanian oil and gas industry with nearly 30 years of experience in providing equipment, labor, and services to the global oil and gas industry.  Rompetrol has substantial upstream, downstream and refining assets, which are principally located in Romania.  The original state-owned entity, Rompetrol S.A., privatized in 1994 to become the largest private company in the oil and gas field in Romania.  In February 2001, the Rompetrol Group acquired the Petromidia refinery and petrochemical plant.  Petromidia is Romania's largest and most modern refinery.  Designed and built from 1975-1977 and modernized in the early 1990s, Petromidia processes a wide variety of crude oils, from low to medium sulphur content.  It is the only Romanian refinery producing Jet A-1 fuel and plans to become the prime supplier of jet fuel for aviation companies operating in Romania and Moldova.  Petromidia is an important source of gasoline, liquefied petroleum gasoline (LPG), and diesel supply to Rompetrol's and other retail networks.  Additionally, Petromidia’s strategic location on the Danube River - Black Sea channel makes Petromidia the Romanian "flagship" refinery with a maximum rated capacity of 14,000 tons/day.

In acquiring the refinery, the Rompetrol Group committed to performing $205 million in investment in the refinery over the next five years, as well as an additional $20 million in environmental investment.  The current technology units used to refine gasoline products at the Petromidia refinery are outdated and operated in a manner that reduces the effectiveness of sulfur recovery, and fails to meet environmental requirements.  The complex processes that Petromidia currently undertakes to recover sulfur from sour water and acid gases creates excess pollution, increased quantities of hydrogen sulfide (which impacts air quality), and in some cases excess ammonia, which affects wastewater.  In order to achieve environmental requirements, produce additional salable products and improve production rates, Petromidia’s GDSR systems must be modernized.   

The new design would remove ammonia from the water and air, remove hydrogen sulfide and severely limit sulfur dioxide emissions, produce an additional 8,000 tons of solid sulfur for sale each year, and produce about 12,500 tons per ear of sulfuric acid for internal use or sale.     

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $331,045 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, OCTOBER 1, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals

<DESC>The Government desires to solicit comments to the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) provided under this synopsis.  All comments and requested information are to be submitted via electronic mail, and are due by 4:00 PM on 17 July 2003.  It is requested that interested parties provide the business size of their company.  Telephone and facsimile responses to this synopsis will not be accepted.  On 11 February 2002, the Department of the Navy announced the Navy Region Mid-Atlantic (Program Manager Public Safety) as a candidate for a Commercial Activities study in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76.  The intent of the study is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method of providing Fire and Security Dispatch Support Services for all installations and facilities under the command of the Commander, United States Navy Region, Mid-Atlantic (CNRMA) located in the Norfolk, Virginia area.  Limiting conditions for this acquisition include the need for the Service Provider to be fully capable of supporting (a) Calltaker Operations, (b) Security, Fire, and Emergency Medical Dispatch, (c) Emergency Communications and Fire-box Monitoring, (d) Security Communications and Research, and (e) Electronic Security Systems and Access Control. The Fire and Security Dispatch Support Services required for CNRMA will include: the installations and facilities at the Sewells Point, Little Creek, Virginia Beach, and Portsmouth Precincts. Accordingly, the Service Provider must be capable of gaining access to all facilities requiring support, to include the ability to obtain all necessary security clearances.  The offeror determined to represent the best value to the Government will be compared to the Government’s proposal to perform the Fire and Security Dispatch Support Services.  The Government intends to negotiate a Firm-Fixed Price contract.  The resulting contract will be for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  NAICS 561210 applies.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences’ (DCCPS), Office of Cancer Survivorship (OCS), plans to procure on a sole source basis services for the second CancerCare Cancer Survivorship Teleconference series from Cancer Care, Inc., 275 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001.  As we race into the new millennium, cancer for increasing numbers has become a curable illness and for most, a controllable disease.  However, it is becoming rapidly apparent that few of our modern therapies are benign.  The chronic and late effects of cancer and its treatment can range from mild and transient problems, to serious and at times fatal conditions, and affect all aspects of function: physical, functional, emotional, social and economic.  Over the past decade, CancerCare, Inc. has pioneered educational teleconferences as a means of extending the capacity or ‘reach’ of efforts to communicate important health information.  CancerCare’s Telephone Education Workshops have become a highly effective method through which to disseminate information about cancer to as broad an audience as possible – immediately overcoming barriers created by distance, physical disability and geographic isolation.  CancerCare’s educational teleconferences currently serve over 35,000 individuals in the US and abroad.  Participants engage in educational discussions in which scientific and clinical experts summarize current knowledge about and  techniques to address all aspects of the cancer experience.  The CancerCare organization offers approximately 70 to 75 cancer-related educational teleconference programs each year. The “Cancer Survivorship:  Living with, Through, and Beyond Cancer’ teleconference series focuses on post-treatment issues for cancer survivors and their families and caregivers.  CancerCare, along with its partners (National Cancer Institute, Intercultural Cancer Council and Living Beyond Breast Cancer), conducted the first three part series in Spring of 2003 and will produce the second follow-up series in the Spring 2004.  Currently, CancerCare is the exclusive coordinator of the CancerCare: Cancer survivorship teleconference series.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 p.m. EDT, on September 16, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NAICS 541990

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA This modification is to answer questions submitted by a potential offeror. 1.	What is the type/model of speakers and how many? ANSWER:  Requesting Allen brand speakers; a complete set to include the bass cabinet, or equal. 2.	Smart midi is mentioned.  Do they want the Expander II or the Midi Division II? ANSWER:  Requesting Allen brand Midi Division, or equal. 3.	Length of cable? ANSWER:  Upon award of contract, a site visit would need to be made by the vendor to determine the length of the cable. 4.	The wood is required to match the chapel.  We need to know what finish is required.  This is very important because if the finish is something other than one of the companies standard finishes there will probably be no one who can fulfill the contract b ecause of the delivery schedule. ANSWER:  The wood is to match the Chapel.  Upon award of contract, a site visit would need to be made by the vendor to determine the correct wood color. 5.    The sol. mentions a 420 watt audio system.  The organ comes with 320 watts of power.  Is this a mistake, or are they thinking of the organ with a 100 watt bass cabinet (as mentioned in question #1)? ANSWER:  The audio system will total 420 watts. 6.	Is the 10 year warranty on parts and labor required. ANSWER:  Yes, a 10 year warranty on parts and labor is required. Finally, note that this modification also extends the original close date from September 2, 2003, 2:00 pm to September 8, 2003, 2:00 pm.

<DESC>This modification is being posted for clarification purposes only.
Environmental Control Unit- The Atmospheric Early Warning system (AEWS) at the Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC/LHE) is seeking acquisition of Environmental Control Units (ECU). The Government is currently refining an acquisition strategy for ECU’s to support remote radar facilities in Alaska, Hawaii, Canada and Puerto Rico. The new family of ECUs have updated performance requirements outlined for the AN/FPS-117 Radar. This AN/FPS specification is used only as a reference for this Sources Sought Synopses (SSS).  The plan is to purchase in fiscal year 2004 approximately 52 identical ECU’s. This SSS is for market research purposes only and respondents are reminded a formal solicitation may not necessarily result. Information received as a result of this market survey may be reflected in a formal solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate respondents for any costs incurred in developing information provided to OO-ALC-LHE. Recommend that information be limited to that readily available and that proprietary information not be included. However without written permission from the respondent, OO-ALC-LHE will not release to any firm, agency or individual outside the Government any information marked proprietary Response packages should be delivered in two paper copies, including brochures, software copies (Microsoft Word or Excel) may be delivered along with the paper copies. The response packages are due to Justen Bonham OO-ALC-LHKC   address: 6029 Wardleigh Road, Hill AFB UT 84056-5638.

General Requirements: The new ECU’s will replace existing equipment at remote radar sites. Modifications to existing sheet metal ducting may be required. Repair of wall from any hole created from removal of existing duct shall also be required. Removal of ducting may include potential Hazmat problems such as asbestos in the wall/piping and lead paint. Intake dampers will need to be routed and controlled remotely to both inside and outside of the building/tower as weather dictates. Return air must be modulated to avoid a negative pressure inside the building/tower. Two ECUs will be installed and work in tandem alternating as back-up and have a direct digital control (DDC) panel with remote diagnostic and programming capabilities at each radar site.  Since commercial off-the-shelf equipment is expected to satisfy this requirement, a twelve-month warranty of equipment and installation and support software is required beginning after successful acceptance tests at each site. Contractor will be required to perform site surveys since many sites are unique. Operational manual, drawings and Interface description (ICD) shall be included. Refrigerant used must comply with the environmental laws of the country the ECU is operating in. 

Scope: The microprocessor control system (MCS) shall be fully integrated and installed as a complete package by a single contractor. The contractor shall furnish all materials including all computer hardware and software, operator input/output peripherals, field hardware panels, sensors and field control devices and installed wiring. The contractor shall be responsible for engineering, installation, labor services, system calibration, initial software programming and system checkout as necessary to provide a complete and fully operational MCS as specified herein.

Control power: 120/208 volts, 3 Phase, 4 wire, 60 Hertz. Cannon type connectors shall be used. Control power and signal wiring shall be segregated throughout the installation of this project, and shall be kept at least three feet apart at all times. Under no circumstances shall power and signal wiring be run in the same raceway. Control signal wiring shall be routed clear of all lighting ballasts and other electro-magnetic devices that may damage the integrity of the control signal. Controller should be shielded from possible outside interference.

Specific requirements: Equipment must be capable to withstand cold soak temperatures of minus 70 F and must be able to maintain 60 degrees Fahrenheit within four hours. Operating temperatures will be from 0F to 120F. Return air dry- bulb temperature shall be 60 F plus or minus 5F at 100F ambient with a total cooling capacity of 60,000 BTUs. Total heating capability shall be at least 15KW.  Due to restricted facility space the ECU must have exhaust, intake and return ports originating from the top and or front of the ECU. All components must be readily accessible from the front of the ECU. ECU must be able to withstand storage altitudes up to 40,000 feet. Operational altitudes are between sea level and 15,000 feet. The DDC system shall be capable of executing the following standard control routines: ECU heating and ECU cooling failure alarms, high and low temperature alarms, maintenance time reminders, trend logs, supply air reset, enthalpy control, remote damper control, economizer or free cooling control, automatic and manual switchover of backup ECUs, fault override capability and remote reset for heat, cooling and fan modes. Sensors will be installed to monitor fault isolation and provide remote diagnostic feedback for the following: high temperature switch, low temperature switch, return air, outside air, supply air, mixed air, damper control, condenser air inlet, evaporator air pressure, differential air pressure for filter, expansion valve, condenser fan, ECU cabinet temperature, room thermostat, humidity control, dry bulb, wet bulb, high head pressure alarm and low suction pressure alarm.

Computer interface: A standard interface protocol shall be used. Transfer Control Protocol Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is preferred for the AN/FPS-117 system. The controller output shall be Category 5 and connect to existing 10 Base T- 10 Base 2 hub /converter in the equipment room. Vendor will need to integrate controller interface protocol with existing proprietary AN/FPS 117 radar software.

Expansion: Expansion of the Microprocessor control systems (MCS) shall accommodate additional hardware components to meet future expansion requirements but shall not require special software to achieve this expansion that modifies the operation of the system or its operating systems.

<DESC>The following information is added as a result of questions received regarding the statement of work for this project.

(1)  Is there any information available concerning the size/length of the existing courses and what software was used to produce them originally.  Specifically, are they currently web-enabled?
ANSWER: Each lesson is based on a 3 - 3.5 minute voice recording, so each lesson is close to the same size.  (There are 10 lessons in each of the 4 languages.)  

The Voice .wav file is 32 MB; the Transcript Word .doc file is 35 KB, the Acrobat .pdf file is 64.7 KB; 

the Translation .doc file is 34.5 KB, .pdf file is 85.9 KB; 

the Glossary .doc file is 128 KB, the .pdf file is 290 KB; 

the Cloze Exercise .doc file is 31.5 KB, the .pdf file is 93.5 KB; 

the Grader Key .doc file is 34.5 KB, the .pdf file is 102 KB.

All files for all 10 lessons are contained in digital form on CD, one for each of the 4 languages.  Currently linguists listen to the voice on cassette tape, and use hard-copies of all the graphic files.  No work has been done toward making them usable on computer beyond ensuring their availability in digital file form.   
 

(2)  Would it be possible to view a sample of the ten courses?  
ANSWER:  A sample lesson will be e-mailed to all receipients of the SOW, today, 02 Sep 03.

ANSWER: MultiLingual Solutions, Inc.
        22 West Jefferson Street, Suite 402
        Rockville, MD 20850
        Tel. 301.424.7444
        FAX 301.424.7331  

(5)  The synopsis related to this project states that a written solicitation will not be issued.  Does this mean that the synopsis will be the only source of information for this project?
ANSWER: A Statement of work and sample lesson is available upon receipt of a faxed or e-mailed request. 

(6)  Is there a deadline for the project to be completed or are the competitors free to propose a schedule?

<SOLNBR>DAAB07-03-R-L658
<RESPDATE>100203
<ARCHDATE>12012003
<CONTACT>Nicholas Lentis, (732)427-1467
<DESC>NA The United States Government (USG) seeks to procure a form fit and function replacement for Spares of the Airborne Radio Relay System (RRS) AN/ARW-85v (2) and the Radio Relay Test Set, RRTS, AN/URM-214, part of the existing Commanders Tactical Terminal (CT T). These spares are needed in GRCS aircraft for all 4 Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) systems in the field today. CTT hardware is incorporated into both ground and airborne systems and consists of four major sub-components: a Communications Terminal (CT), a Radio Relay System (RRS) on board the RC-12 aircraft, a Radio Relay Test Set (RRTS) used to support pre-flight checks and a Security Data System (SDS) located in the Ground Processing Facility (GPF).    This Request for Information is for a potential source to provide a Ã¢Â€ÂœsolutionÃ¢Â€Â in the form of a white paper.  It is for a COTS/NDI commercial equivalent solution.  No funding will be provided for any responses to this inquiry.  The intent of the Government is to give widest distribution within the Government of the white paper.  If available, the white paper shall provide Corporate Information/History, commercial pricing information, availability, delivery, life cycle cost reduction, and any other  pertinent product and corporate information.   Background.  The RRS, AN/ARW-85v (2) and the RRTS, AN/URM-214.  The PM is working to upgrade the existing Commanders Tactical Terminal (CTT) Airborne Radio Relay System (RRS)/Interface Cancellation System (ICS) in nine (9) aircraft; six RC-12H's and three RC-12D's for installation in Guardrail System 3 in Korea.  All nine ICSs have been built and delivered to the government.  PM ACS currently owns six RRS units.  Four RRS are onsite and two are in use at Raytheon, St. Petersburg, FL.  Three additional RRS w ill be procured from Raytheon E-Systems, Falls Church, Virginia.  This effort was added to an existing contract as a modification for supplies/services.  After fielding the remaining 3 in 4QFY04, all nine RRSs will be available for fielding in Korea.  The plan is to field the RRSs/ICSs (total of nine units each) when JTT is fielded to the 3rd MI in early FY05. During this build of three additional units, the program team identified an extensive list of obsolete/vanishing vendor parts.  The program team has expended significant effort locating sources for parts and has paid premiums for parts that are no longer in production.  This is not only an issue for the three new units being built, but also an issue for sustainment of the fielded systems.  All Guardrai l fielded systems will have this capability.  Continuing support of obsolete parts adds significant material and labor costs for the RRS team.  Currently there are no spares or a Ã¢Â€Âœtest standÃ¢Â€Â being procured for the System 3 RRS/ICS.  Only equipme nt on aircraft Ã¢Â€Âœnot in useÃ¢Â€Â could be used as Ã¢Â€ÂœsparesÃ¢Â€Â.  There is currently no repair/failure data.   The RRS, AN/ARW-85v (2).  This unit is comprised of a Signal Data Translator, a digitally controlled Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio receiver and transmitter, and rack/harness assembly.  The function of the RRS is to receive the uplink data for retransmis sion on UHF and receive UHF data for downlink to the Ground Processing Facilities (GPF). The RRS is the interface between the CTT RF link and the Interoperable Data Link (IDL) to provide support for multiple relay capability.  The RRS also provides the cap ability to reduce the level of transmissions at the input of the Prime Mission Equipment (PME).  The RRS acts to extend the operational range between the Integrated Processing Facility (IPF) and the field terminals of the Commanders Tactical Terminal (CTT)  system.  All data handled by the relay is encrypted.  The relay has no ability to encrypt/decrypt data but serves simply as a conduit for data from terminal to terminal.  The RRS uses the higher altitude of the sensor platform to extend/increase the Line of Sight (LOS) communication rang e between the CTT field terminals and the CTT terminal in the IPF.   The RRTS, AN/URM-214.  This unit supports pre-flight checkout, operational verification, and fault isolation of the RRS. The RRTS is located on flight lines at relay platform ground sites and is comprised of a receiver/transmitter test group and a test con troller and cable/case assembly.  CTT airborne relay subsystems are located on board the Army RC-12 aircraft.  Airborne configuration.  The frequency agile RRS is a standard configuration for later GUARDRAIL aircraft.  The GUARDRAIL/Common Sensor System 4 CTT Retrofit, 15 March 1993, Document Number 69-188245 has incorporated the RRS into the RC-12K. The RC-12H and  RC-12D System 3 aircraft will have retrofitted units with minor modifications required for the Ã¢Â€ÂœDÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœHÃ¢Â€Â configurations.  The RRS is mounted in the RC-12K Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) aircraft.  The RRS is installed in dedicated sp aces in the Airborne Relay Facility (ARF) racks of the RC-12K using a rack harness assembly.  The contractor must assume any ground modifications, as required for the GRF and the AGE Van.  TRW has made recent changes, IAW the March 1993 CTT Retrofit docume nt.   Maintenance.  In the past, the RRS team decided to send these six ICSÃ¢Â€Â™s and the six RRSÃ¢Â€Â™s back to the manufacturer for repair/re-certification. As a result of this decision, it is considered sufficient for the operator to run BITE test to be used  to determine the functionality of these boxes.   If feasible, RRSs should be refurbished at Tobyhanna Army Depot.   Air Worthiness Request (AWR).  Since this system is located in the airframe, it must meet airworthiness standards.  For AWR, contractors develop the EMI/EMC and safety compliance documentation to ensure obtaining an Air-Worthiness Release (AWR).  Also, cer tification technical packages have been required by the contractor and submitted for comments to the CECOM Flight Activity and delivered through GUARDRAIL PM to AMCOM Fixed Wing (FW) System Engineering. The AWR is usually submitted 30 days after contract.  It may be possible to perform an installation in one RC-12D Test Bed aircraft at the CECOM Flight Activity.  When the installation is complete the referenced drawings will be attached to the AWR and become a part of the aircraft record.  Testing.  Technical testing will also be a required activity of the contractor.  A test plan shall be prepared that exercises the performance of the ground and airborne interface and sub-system functions of the RRS.  The contractor shall support field inst allation and testing of the sub-system.  This support shall include both aircraft and ground station components. The contractor shall support the system integration in the development of Site Acceptance Test Procedures to verify proper operation of the ins talled capabilities both at the aircraft and IPF. This shall include both ground and in-flight tests.  Any AGE Van and IPF Retrofit should also be completed to properly test aircraft retrofit.  Pre-fielding testing may be conducted (at Lakehurst NAS, NJ, c ontractor facility, or other government facility such as Fort Hood, Texas). Field locations may be OCONUS and CONUS.    The white paper discussion shall include a solution that does not exceed the Airborne RRS payload as included in the table below.  Since the RRTS does not have airborne payload requirements, the specified weights and dimensions are not relevant to this dis cussion.

<ARCHDATE>11132003
<CONTACT>Becci Winkler, 928-328-6163
<DESC>NA Sole Source.  The United States Army Yuma Proving Ground (USAYPG), Yuma, Arizona intends to negotiate a sole source requirements contract with NAC Image Technology, 2245 First Street, Unit 108, Simi Valley, CA 93065 for up to eight (8) each  NAC HSV-500C3 High Speed Color Video Systems and eight (8) each power supplys over and 18-month period. The original equipment manufacturer of the model HSV500C3 high-speed video systems is NAC and they hold all patent and technical data rights on the imbedded software,  firmware and hardware. The NAC HSV-500C3 camera is the only known 3-CCD  high-speed video system which possesses the shutter speed of 1/10,000, frame rate  up to 500 pps and horizontal/vertical sensing area of 510 height by 485 vertical resolution that me et mission needs for data reduction and validation that records on low-cost, readily availble S-VHS or VHS tape. This system is also the only known system that can record up to 43 minutes at this rate of speed. USAYPG currently owns six HSV500C3 high-speed  video systems. To maintain the high quality and matching of existing data type for reduction and validation, any new systems acquired must be 100 percent compatible and interchangeable by form, fit and function to the existing NAC HSV-500C3 high-speed vid eo systems, model 6145B IRIG processors and capable of remote communications via computer software interfaces. The speeds, rates and resolutions which are produced by the Model HSV500C3 systems are considered the standard for data collection used at USAYPG  and its sister Army test ranges.  Acquiring high-speed video systems that do not possess the shutter speed, frame rate, vertical/horizontal sensing area of the NAC HSV-500C3 will not only degrade the quality of new data gathered, but will not be interchan geable with current data collection rates for comparison and compatibility. There is no technical data package for this acquisition as NAC holds all technical data rights. Attempting to compete this acquisition would represent a substantial duplication of cost to the government to attain compatability with existing IRIG encoders and decoders and to regerate existing data and validate it in other formats and speeds. The proposed requirements contract for the NAC HSV-500C3 shall be for 18-months commencing on  date of award. Delivery of each HSV-500C3 will be within 45-days of each delivery order. This action is considered to be commercial in nature as the items are commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Par ts 12 and 13 will be used for award. This acquisition falls under SIC 5043 and NAICS 423410 with a small business standard of 100 employees or less. Interested parties may submit evidence of data rights to the NAC HSV-500C3 and technical literature and sho wing their capability to meet the Government's requirement no later than 5:00 PM, MST on 14 September 2003 under acquisition number DABK41-03-R-0207.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes and no solicitation will be issued. A deter mination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is based upon responses to this notice and solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competi tive acquisition. See Note 22, with the exception that the time period for receipt of technical capability offers for consideration is 10 days instead of 45 days as this is acquision is considered a COTS item.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation is seeking sources to manage and staff the Science and Technology Policy Institute in support of Office of Science and Technology Policy in accordance with requirements delineated below.    

 MANDATE AND GOVERNANCE 

As reflected in U.S. Code: Title 42 USC §6686 (herein referred to as “the Act’), Congress mandated the establishment of a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) to be known as the Science and Technology Policy Institute (hereinafter in this document referred to as “the Institute”).  The Institute was established to assist the Executive Branch as it formulates federal policy involving science and technology by providing objective, high quality analytic support to inform policymakers.  The Act specified the duties of the Institute as follows:

Assemble timely and authoritative information regarding significant science and technology developments and trends in the United States and abroad.

Analyze and interpret the information referred to above, with particular attention to the scope and content of the Federal science and technology R&D portfolio as it affects interagency and national issues. 

Conduct studies and analyses of alternatives available for ensuring the long-term strength of the U.S. in the development and application of science and technology, including appropriate roles for the Federal Government and other sectors.

Provide, upon request of the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), technical support and assistance for the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology (PCAST) and to committees and panels of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).

Consult widely with representatives from private industry, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit institutions and incorporate, to the extent practicable, information and perspectives derived from such consultations in carrying out its work.

Please see FAR 35.017 “Federally Funded Research and Development Centers”, for qualification and policy regulations, http://www.arnet.gov/far/.

 SPONSORS’ CONCEPT OF THE INSTITUTE 

NSF and OSTP  (hereinafter referred to as “the Sponsors”) conceive that the Institute will operate as follows:    

*  While NSF is the primary sponsor of the Institute, OSTP should be viewed as its primary customer. In general OSTP will provide technical direction and oversight while NSF will provide business, financial and contractual oversight.

*  The Institute shall meet special research and analysis needs of is sponsors, whether short-term or long-term that cannot be met as effectively by using existing in-house or normal contractor resources. The Institute shall provide its sponsors with a network of institutional and individual sources of expertise that could not be contained within a single organization.
The Institute shall inform its sponsors and other government policymakers through the objective, independent, and high quality analysis and assembly of information, in contrast to taking advocacy positions.  

*  The Institute shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special long-term relationship with the Government; i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts-of-interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its sponsors, and to serve the unique needs of its sponsors, while holding their full confidence and trust.

  MANAGEMENT PLAN  

The organization that is awarded the contract to operate the Institute (hereinafter referred to as the “Contractor”) shall set up, provide the necessary space and equipment, support and technical personnel to establish and manage the Institute, as an FFRDC in accordance with the Sponsors’ concept for the Institute described above. 

The Contractor, through the Institute, will be responsible for planning and executing such research and analysis as the Sponsors may specify.  Such research and analysis may include quick-response, ad-hoc analysis and technical support, short-term studies (up to one month), medium-term studies (1-6 months) and long-term studies (more than six months). The Contractor will also provide staff and technical support for the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (“PCAST”) and the National Science and Technology Council (“NSTC”), as deemed necessary.  Task areas may include but are not limited to:   

*National Security
*Critical Infrastructure Protection
*Health and the Environment
*Space/Transportation
*Information/Telecommunication Infrastructure and Technology
*Education/Training
*R&D Portfolio, including emerging S&T issues
*PCAST and NSTC Support 
*Development of New Analytic Methods and Tools

The Contractor will be responsible for hiring a certified public accounting firm to conduct: (1) annual financial audits of the operations of the Institute (and certify annual financial statements), and (2) all audits required either under OMB circulars or under the cost principles applicable to the Institute.  

    TASKS FOR OTHER THAN THE SPONSORS    

It is not the Government’s intent that an FFRDC use its privileged information or access to facilities to compete with the private sector.  However, an FFRDC may perform work for other than the sponsoring agency under the Economy Act, or other applicable legislation, when the work is not otherwise available from the private sector. 

  This is allowable, provided:    

* The task is consistent with the duties and responsibilities of the Institute as specified in the Act. 
* The Institute has received the prior written approval of the Sponsors. 
* Funding for the projects has been transferred from the funding agency or agencies to the NSF and added to the Institute contract. 
* The Institute and the sponsoring agency or agencies agree to fully disclose all aspects of the work being performed, including draft documents, to the Sponsors upon request.

  QUALIFIED OFFERORS RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS  

It is requested that qualified firms interested in supporting the Institute submit a statement of their capabilities to perform the work as described in this notice, this statement should not exceed 10 pages.  Efforts should be made to keep responses as BRIEF as possible, concentrating on substantive information essential for a proper review/consideration. The Government will not pay for the cost of response submission.  
 
  ELIGIBILITY QUALIFIERS  

As specified in the Act, the Institute shall be: (1) administered as a separate entity by an organization currently managing another FFRDC.

Qualified organizations must possess a broad interdisciplinary staff with backgrounds pertinent to the environment in which it is expected to operate.

Qualified organizations must be able to work effectively and in a timely manner with Federal organizations, institutions and personnel in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.

  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FOR QUALIFIED RESPONDENTS  

In accordance with FAR 15.201 and 15.202, the NSF will offer the opportunity for one-on-one meetings with qualified offerors.  The purpose of this exchange is to improve the understanding of the Government’s requirements and industry capabilities, while allowing potential offerors to judge weather or how they can meet the Government’s requirements.  Only the information submitted under this response will be considered during these meetings, additional information/amendments to responses after the close of this notice are not authorized.  The information provided will also allow the Government to advise prospective offerors of their potential to be a viable competitor.  After meeting with each qualified offeror, the Government will provide advisement as to if the offeror is a viable candidate.  The Government’s determination will be based on the information submitted and is to be treated as advisement not a final determination.  This advisement does not preclude an offeror from submitting a proposal nor does it guarantee contract award to a likely candidate. 

Each response to this notice will be evaluated based on the aforementioned qualifiers; this will serve as the basis for evaluation.

To assist in the development of a response and understanding of this requirement, the NSF has attached the NSF Review Panel on the STPI to this notice.  The charge to the Panel is contained on page 5 of the report.  This information is for reference only and is not part of the “official” statement of work.

Mailed responses can be sent to the National Science Foundation, Attn: Jamala A. Jones, Contract Specialist, Division of Acquisition and Cost Support, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Room 475.05, Arlington, VA  22230 or electronically at jajones@nsf.gov.  

Facsimile responses are not authorized for this request.   This is not a Request for Proposal; therefore no contract will be awarded resultant of this notice.  The NSF will synopsize the competition for this requirement on or about the beginning of April 2003.  It is anticipated that a request for proposal will be issued on or about the end of May 2003 with a proposal due date on or about the beginning of July 2003.

<DESC>9720-82 Facility - REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS NO. HE703

BWXT Y-12, L.L.C. (Company), acting under Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22800 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE), invites you to submit a response to this Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to perform construction of the 9720-82 Facility at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

THIS IS NOT AN ORDER.  Award will be made on the Company’s subcontract form or by other written notice.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The 9720-82 Facility will support the DOE and Y-12 national defense missions. No allowance for Foreign Nationals will be granted. Construction of the approximately 135,000 square foot building is estimated to be in the range of between $40 and $60 million dollars. The planned building footprint is approximately 450 feet by 300 feet with a height of approximately 40 feet. The construction site is approximately 7 acres and is at the Y-12 National Security Complex. Physical access to the site will be from Tennessee State Route 95 and Bear Creek Road West. The work location does not require Q-Cleared workers, but all construction personnel must be United States citizens with assigned identification badges and vehicle passes. Construction work at the Y-12 National Security Complex requires the successful firm to become signatory to the Construction Labor Agreement with the Knoxville Building and Construction Trades Council. 

Work scope consists of procurement of materials and installation of the following:

Site Work--Excavation and backfill for underground utilities, grading, underground and above ground utility installation, trenches, access roads, erosion control, and site restoration.

Civil/Structural—Administrative offices, mechanical/electrical and storage areas consisting of seismically qualified, cast in place, reinforced concrete building foundations, walls, and columns, structural steel racks/supports, roofing, and loading docks.

Architectural--Suspended ceiling, sheet rock, cubicles, lockers, restroom facilities/partitions, interior and exterior doors, scuppers, downspouts, signs, insulation, and painting.

Mechanical--Zoned building pressurization, including Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, utility piping, fire protection, and plumbing.

Electrical--Power, lighting, grounding, communication, and alarm systems.

Controls--Instrumentation packages for security and utility systems.

Equipment--Installation of government and subcontractor furnished equipment including piping, electrical components, and instrumentation. 

Testing Support--Test, checkout, and startup support for systems, structures, and components.  

Quality Control/Quality Assurance--Requirements will be per DOE 414.1A.

GENERAL INFORMATION

This request is for the purpose of soliciting statements of qualifications from those firms who are capable of responding affirmatively to the 9720-82 Facility Notice of Intent Participation Criteria, posted in FedBizOps. The 9720-82 source-selection team will down-select to establish a short-list of firms utilizing a qualifications-based selection process.  Statements of qualification received in response to this RFQ will be evaluated against the criteria described in Attachment 1 and selected firms will receive the Request for Proposal (RFP).

Technical RFP documents for this project will contain Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information and Official Use Only information which requires special information security preparations on the part of the short-listed firms prior to receiving the RFP. Due to the content of the RFP, all short-listed firms will be required to designate two personnel who must complete Company-provided training to function as Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI) Reviewing Official(s), Computer Security Officer(s), and Information Security Officer(s). These individuals must be capable of receiving a DOE L-Clearance and later upgraded to that of a Q-Clearance.  The offeror must be prepared to send these two individuals to Oak Ridge for information security training promptly upon shortlist notification. The Company may install Secure Telephone Units (provided by the Company) at the offeror’s offices and certify the computer server for UCNI processing. Due to the requirement for the constructor to have a few personnel with security clearances, the successful offeror must be capable of obtaining a favorable Foreign Ownership, Control, or Interest (FOCI) determination from the Government in order to be eligible for subcontract award. All subcontractor personnel working on this facility must be United States citizens. 

After the information security activities are completed for all the shortlisted offerors, the RFP may be issued, to which a price and technical proposal must be submitted.  Upon completion of the technical and price proposal review and final negotiations, the Company intends to award a firm-fixed price subcontract for the construction of the new 9720-82 facility.

CONTRACTING METHODOLOGY

The evaluation of the proposals submitted in response to the RFP issued to the short-listed firms will address the assessment of the realism and reasonableness of the price proposal and technical proposal merits.  The Company will use a source selection process in which the offeror’s price, RFQ Statement of Qualifications (SOQ), and RFP technical submittal are all considered.  Price is an important criterion, although less so than the composite technical factor.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal contains the combination of technical excellence and price that offers the best overall value to the Government.

Determination of the short-list is forecast for November 2003.  Issuance of the RFP to the short-listed firms is forecast for January 2004. The Company reserves the right to solicit from all available sources relevant information concerning the offeror’s record of performance and use this information in the evaluation and selection process.  Subcontract award is anticipated in September 2004, but will ultimately depend upon the availability of funding from Congress.  The total subcontract period of performance is expected to be approximately thirty months.

For programmatic reasons, this solicitation has been issued in advance of receipt of funds that would permit a subcontract to be awarded.  Funds are expected to become available in July 2004.  No legal liability on the part of the Company for any payment may arise until funds are made available and a subcontract is awarded.


SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS

Firms that meet the requirements of this announcement and desire consideration are requested to submit the original, plus 8 copies each, of their Statement of Qualifications on or before 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on September 26, 2003. Consideration of any submission received after the time specified but before award is solely within the Company’s discretion. The SOQ will be evaluated against the criteria described in Attachment 1. All proposals must be appropriately labeled, and the original should be identified.  The amount of material must be limited to no more than 50 double-sided pages, excluding resumes, Environment, Safety and Health Plan, and Substance Abuse Plan.  Specific and detailed information is to be included.  Each responding firm is responsible for providing adequate information to best represent their organization and its member’s (including proposed subcontractors and consultants) qualifications to perform the full range of services covered by this announcement.

A response may contain technical data and other data, including trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information, which the Respondent does not want disclosed to the public or used by the company or the Government for any purpose other than response evaluation.  To protect such data, the Respondent must specifically identify each page, including each line or paragraph thereof containing the data to be protected, and attach to the response cover sheet containing the following notice:



Notice

The data contained in pages ______ of this Statement of Qualifications (SOQ) response have been submitted in confidence and contain trade secrets and/or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information, and such data will be used or disclosed only for SOQ evaluation purposes, provided that if a subcontract is awarded to this Respondent as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this response, the Company and the Government will have the right to use or disclose the data herein to the extent provided in the subcontract.  This restriction does not limit the Company’s and the Government’s rights to use or disclose data obtained without restriction from any source, including the Respondent.

Reference to the above notice on the Cover Sheet must be placed on each page to which the notice applies.  The Company assumes no liability for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose such data for any purpose.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education is proposing to enter into an agreement with the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) for the payment of the yearly membership dues owed by the United States for the calendar years 2003 and 2004.  These dues are $27,000 per year.  IEA is an organization of governments and university researchers interested in cross-national comparisons of education systems.  The IEA has sponsored numerous international projects since the 1960s, including the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS), the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), and, most recently, the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).  The United States has participated in IEA studies since its inception, providing international leadership in the area of assessment and survey operations.  Approximately 50 countries are members of the IEA.  Each country appoints a representative to the IEA, which holds a General Assembly meeting annually.  As a major supporter of the IEA, the U.S. representative also serves on the Standing Committee of the IEA, which meets yearly to help set the agenda for the annual meetings as well as discuss new projects and developments.  Failure to pay yearly dues in the IEA would result in the suspension of membership for the United States.  All responsible sources that believe they can accomplish this work may submit capability statements in writing to Helen.Chang@ed.gov by 2:00 EST September 10, 2003.   Any questions should be directed to Helen Chang at Phone 202-708-9740.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for commercial food distributors.  This notice is not a request for proposals and it is being published solely for the purpose of assessing the availability of qualified sources.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this type of work is 422410, “General Line Grocery Wholesalers”.  To qualify as a small business in this Industry, a firm must have less than 100 employees.  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is seeking qualified sources for a potential performance based contract to: 1) procure food items meeting USDA commodity specifications, 2) accept food orders from eligible recipients via an internet based ordering system, and 3) deliver the food to the eligible recipients.  Additionally, the firm must be capable of accepting, storing and delivering selected food items provided by USDA to the agencies participating in the three Programs identified in this notice, as well as victims of natural disasters.

Background Information: The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR), the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) and the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) are federally mandated food distribution programs which operate in the Food and Nutrition Service’s Midwest Region.  The States include Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.  The total quantity of product delivered to programs located in these States averages approximately 570,000 cases per year.  Approximately 80 food items in household size packages must be available at all times to fill food orders.  All food items must comply with the “Buy American” provisions contained in the Food Distribution Program regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), reference 7 CFR Part 250.23.  The various food items have different temperature requirements, and the distributor must have the capability of making deliveries in vehicles that can handle food items with multiple temperature requirements. The food is delivered to approximately 51 different locations, some to remote locations such as Dowagiac, MI; Mahnomen, MN; and Bayfield WI.  The food shipments will include primarily FDPIR and CSFP, with occasional shipments to other programs, such as TEFAP.  The regulations for these programs may be found under the CFR; FDPIR (7 CFR Part 253) and CSFP (7 CFR Part 247).  The CFR may be accessed at www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr.

FDPIR is a federal program that provides commodity foods to low-income households living on Indian reservations, and to Native American families residing in designated areas near reservations.  Many Native Americans participate in the FDPIR as an alternative to the Food Stamp Program, usually because they do not have easy access to food stores. 

The CSFP supplements the diets of low-income, pregnant and breastfeeding women, other new mothers up to one-year postpartum, infants, children up to age six, and elderly people at least 60 years of age.  

TEFAP is a federal program that helps supplement the diets of low-income Americans by providing them with emergency food and nutrition assistance at no cost, usually through food banks, which, in turn, distribute the food to soup kitchens and food pantries that directly serve the public.

DISASTER FEEDING - On occasion, commodities are shipped from federal inventory for use in disaster assistance.  USDA must be able to respond within 24 hours following a natural disaster.  USDA provides commodity foods to shelters and mass feeding sites; distributes commodity food packages directly to households in need; and supplies food to disaster relief organizations such as the Red Cross and the Salvation Army.

Sandia National Laboratories
Vulnerability Assessment Methodology for Chemical Facilities
Train-the-Trainer Course in Albuquerque, NM
4-7 November 2003


Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) developed and delivered a course to train chemical companies, chemical facility consultants, security consultants, and other affected parties on the Vulnerability Assessment Methodology for Chemical Facilities (VAM-CFTM).   In cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Justice, National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Sandia is developing a train-the-trainer version of the course to allow other professional trainers to begin offering this course throughout the United States.  The 4-day train-the-trainer course will be offered only one time in 2003, at Sandia’s facilities in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on 4-7 November 2003.  There will be space for a total of approximately 40 individuals.  Each entity desiring to receive this training and certification to train others will be limited to 4 trainers.  Some spaces may be reserved for a not-for-profit entity.  

The goal of the program is to provide certified trainers that will be available to consultants, chemical/petrochemical facilities, and government/tribal entities to support the objective to have vulnerability assessments conducted at chemical facilities.  All certified trainers will be required to publicly provide this training course a minimum number of times.  Details are contained below.

Proposals are being sought from qualified firms that meet the Selection Criteria listed in the next section.  A review panel will evaluate the proposals.  Details on the required criteria, desired criteria, and the proposal requirements are contained below.  At the end of the course, each trainer who has successfully met the course requirements will be offered a license to use the course materials to train others.

A fee of  $1,000 per person will be charged to each trainer to attend the course.  The target audience for courses subsequently offered by the certified trainers will be comprised of the following groups:

<SUBJECT>A--TEAMING OPPORTUNITY NO. 5 FOR THE MISSION AND SCIENCE MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY - 2004 (MSMT-2004) NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT (NRA)
<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop proposals for the Mission and Science Measurement Technology - 2004 (MSMT-2004) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released NASA Research Announcement (NRA-03-OAT-01) entitled, "Mission and Science Measurement Technology - 2004" (see: http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_r/open.cfm).  The MSMT theme seeks proposals for exploratory research and technology development in the Enabling Concepts and Technologies (ECT) Program, which defines new system concepts and develops new technologies to enable scientific measurements in support of the Aerospace Technology Enterprise mission.  The ECT program explores revolutionary aerospace systems, and performs fundamental research and development of high-payoff technologies.  Program objectives are to identify, develop, and transfer breakthrough technologies that have broad potential across many types of systems to provide increased scientific return at lower cost, and to enable missions and capabilities beyond current horizons.  The ECT program is on the front end of the enabling technology pipeline that supplies the focused technology development programs of the NASA Enterprises.   This NRA solicits technologies in three major areas: 1) Advanced Measurement and Detection Technology; 2) Large Aperture Technology; and 3) Low Power Microelectronics Technology.  These three technology areas can be viewed in greater detail via the NRA cite noted above. The ECT program primarily focuses on early stage technologies at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL's) of between 1 and 3, unless otherwise noted in the NRA. (For definitions of TRL's, see Appendix B of the NASA Technology Plan at http://technologyplan.nasa.gov).  The technology requirements guide future development of component and subsystem technologies, with emphasis on efficiency, miniaturization, integration, and resiliency.  The goal is to capture innovative ideas from the external community, to leverage emerging technologies, and to complement NASA capabilities in critical areas.  Successful proposals must outline a well-structured program (for up to three years) for development culminating in a proof-of-concept demonstration at TRL 3-4 by the end of the effort for both the Advanced Measurement and Detection Technology and Large Aperture Technology. (NOTE: The Low Power Microelectronics Technology area requires that proposed activities have an entry TRL of 3 or 4 and that the activity demonstrate a minimum TRL 5 at the end of the proposed activity.) NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the ECT Program to develop proposals and execute proof of concept development and/or component breadboard validation. Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in proof of concept development and/or component breadboard validation contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide proof of concept development and/or component breadboard validation consistent with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criterion evaluates the proposers' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development, and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control This criterion evaluates the proposers' ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposers' facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria.  In all cases, the responder must indicate on the cover page of the proposal (not part of 5-page allocation) the technology area (see below) that applies to their proposal. All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Chris Edwards, Mail Stop 469, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: william.c.edwards@nasa.gov. The due date for submission is COB September 12, 2003. Procurement questions should be directed to Tom Weih, NASA Office of Procurement, 757-864-3878; Carl.T.Weih@larc.nasa.gov Technical questions should be addressed to  the technical point of contact indicated below. The following LaRC technology proposals are seeking partnerships.  (1) Development of Lightweight Scanning Lidar Telescope Technology, Technical Point of Contact: Farzin Amzajerdian, (757) 864-1533, Farzin.Amzajerdian-1@nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners for the development of lightweight scanning lidar telescope technology meeting NASA's Earth Science objectives. Most of the lidar instruments envisioned for future launch require high-quality meter-class telescopes. The telescope along with the laser transmitter is the driver of the total mass and size of these instruments. Therefore, any reduction in the telescope mass can have a major impact on the instrument cost. In addition to weight and cost constraints, some of the lidar concepts require rotating the telescope in order to scan the laser beam about the nadir, which imposes further constraints on the weight of the telescope. In an effort to address the specific needs of space-based lidar instruments, partners being sought with experience and expertise in lightweight optics technology, thermally-stable optical systems, optical diagnostic techniques, and telescope integration and testing.

<SUBJECT>Intent to Secure Sole Source
<DESC>The VA Mid-Atlantic Healthcare Region (VISN6) Central Acquisition Service intends to procure sole source with Kay Elemetric Corporation for a Digital Swallowing Workstation for the VA Medical Center, Salisbury, NC.  Kay's Digital Swallowing Workstation, Model 7200, is a unique combination of three different dysphagia monitoring and evaluating devices which have been integrated into a single system to provide clinicians with a superior tool for evaluating swallowing function.  It allows the clinician and patient to monitor these swallowing processes in real time, thus providing valuable biofeedback necessary for therapy.  The Workstation consists of three distinct modules: the Swallowing Signals Lab, the Computerized Swallowing Video (Fluoro) Analysis module, and the Fiber optic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) system. Each of the Workstation modules can function independently or can be used together as an integrated system.   The Swallowing Workstation would allow the patient to see the FEES video and the respiration signal simultaneously, and in real time, a feature not available on other models.  The Swallowing Signals component integrates a variety of physiologic signals for monitoring swallowing events.  It includes the necessary hardware and transducers to perform dual-channel surface EMG, respiration signal, multi-channel tongue array, acoustic signal, and two auxiliary channels.  The main component of the third module of the Swallowing Workstation consists of custom designed software for the study of swallowing exams. A special feature of this module provides clinicians and researchers with the ability to quickly correlate findings in the video fluoroscopic examination with signals acquired in the Swallowing Signals Lab with precise (frame-specific) accuracy.  It allows the Signals to be displayed simultaneously with the FEES or video fluoroscopic examination.  NAICS code 334510 applies to this procurement.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotations.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations. Interested parties that believe they can meet these needs must supply information about their capabilities no later than 4:30pm EST, September 9, 2003.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  This award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures.  No solicitation will be made available.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The anticipated award date is September 10, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Telephone or faxed inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>MOTOROLA RADIO EQUIPMENT IN SUPPORT OF NAVAIR ORLANDO TRAINING SYSTEMS DIVISION’S (TSD) SECURITY FORCE


NAVAIR Orlando TSD has a requirement for the acquisition of radio equipment and the equipment’s installation in support its Security Department, Code 8.  NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends to satisfy this requirement by negotiating a commercial contract, on a sole source basis, with Motorola Inc.  A firm fixed price contract is anticipated to provide and install the necessary equipment.  This posting constitutes the requirement’s synopsis as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 13.105.  

The requirement includes the acquisition of one Motorola Quantar 125 Watt VHF Repeater including conventional analog and repeater operation; one MC 1000 Tone Desk set; one Motorola VHF radio antenna, Omni-directional, and capable of roof installation; one factory installed duplexer; thirty-five (35) Motorola HT 1000 VHF radios with antennas, spare batteries, shoulder microphones, and six (6) six-unit one-hour chargers; one equipment storage cabinet; and all the necessary power supplies, phone lines, and surge protection.   The contractor will be required to install the equipment and field program the HT 1000 VHF radios to NAVAIR TSD’s assigned frequency.  

Further specifications require the equipment to be APCO 25 compliant, SPS Certified, Narrow band tunable to 12.5 KHz, and the repeater to be upgradeable to data encrypted transmissions.  The source selection for this repeater is limited by FFRS and SFAF regulations to the approved equipment list put out by the Joint Chief’s of Staff and maintained by Navy EMCIMS.  Motorola is the only vendor with an upgradeable repeater on this list, and, therefore is the only source for the acquisition and installation of the equipment.  The radio frequency assigned to NAVAIR Orlando was issued based upon the above listed equipment.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, Section U.S.C., 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by the FAR 6.302-1, Only One Reasonable Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This synopsis is issued to provide notice of our intent to award this effort on a sole source basis to Motorola Inc.; therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to Contract Specialist, Scott Syring, via email at scott.syring@navy.mil or by telephone at (407) 380-4865.
