<DESC>Notice of Intent to Issue a Purchase Order. The Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety &amp; Health (NIOSH), National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) hereby announces its intent to issue a Purchase order to Draeger Safety, Inc. to procure Oxy 6000 Self Contained, Self-Rescuers (SCSR).
<p>Purpose and Objective: to procure Draeger (120 ea.) P/N 630600 Oxy 6000 Self Contained Self-Rescuers (SCSR) for testing and evaluating, in the NIOSH Long-Term Field Evaluation.</p>
<p>Project Background: In order to minimize the probability of SCSR failures and subsequent miner's deaths, NIOSH and its predecessor have conducted a program entitled: the Long term Field Evaluation Program (LTFE). This Program has been in place since the introduction of SCSRs (over 20 years). Each year NIOSH collects deployed SCSRs from active mines across the country and replaces those devices with new units of the same model and manufacturer. The number of each type collected is determined by their portion of the total population of SCSRs in use. Replacing the collected SCSRs with units of the same kind is required/necessary since each manufacturer's unit operates differently and miners at that mine must be trained on the specific device. Mixing of different models of SCRS at any mine would cause confusion and increase the probability of death in an emergency. The collected SCSRs are taken to NPPTL where they are inspected and evaluated for their life support capacity. This program has identified many unexpected failures over the years of operation and have resulted in recalls of SCSRs and improved SCSR design. Miner's lives have been saved by units that would likely have failed if not upgraded due to the LTFE Program.</p>
<p>Responsible Sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to James Ambrozic, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, and Reference 2012-Q-47926. All Vendors must be registered in the Central Contractors Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a Federal Contract. The website is www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine is other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.103-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Draeger Safety Inc., 101 Technology Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15275, as the only source and a Purchase Order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences, intends to award a sole source contract to Indigo Biosystems, Inc, 20 East 91st Street, Suite 200, Indianapolis, IN 46240 for the purchase of Indigo ASCENT automated chromatography analysis and review software including licenses, software configuration for measurement assays, maintenance and support, and hosting services that include computer hardware and configuration for software operation. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The NAICS code for this procurement is 511210, Software Publishers with a size standard of $25M. The period of performance for this procurement is 36 months.
<p><br />ASCENT is a unique software program that use nonlinear fitting of exponentially modified Gaussian peaks to select peaks in chromatograms and determine the area under those peaks. Measuring the area under a peak is essential for measuring the amount of substances in the sample using mass spectrometry. ASCENT speeds analysis of samples by automating peak selection and peak area fitting. ASCENT also includes assay-specific quality assurance rules, which allow peaks to be automatically tested for quality. ASCENT is platform independent so it can be used on mass spectrometers from multiple different manufacturers. ASCENT operates using a web-browser interface requiring no software to be installed on computers in order to perform quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>Indigo Biosystems is the only responsible source capable of meeting all of the Government's requirements because ASCENT is the only software program with automated detection of peaks of interest; automated integration (peak area determination) using peak fitting and integration of the peak fit equation (not trapezoidal summation techniques) and baseline algorithms able to measure area of peaks in high noise areas and peaks with other peaks overlapping their peak areas (e.g., shoulder peaks); automated inclusion of assay-specific quality assurance rules to verify adequate quality of peak integrations and identification; platform independence so it works on mass spectrometers from multiple manufacturers; and the ability to handle peaks from both gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS, GC/MS/MS) systems as well as liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS, LC/MS/MS) systems.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Indigo Biosystems. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit a capabilities statement to provide the services to the Contracting Officer, Vallerie Redd, via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-N-14925 referenced in the subject line <strong>NO LATER THAN August 19, 2012. All requests must be in writing. </strong></p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Lockheed Martin is the design agent, system integrator and the NAVSEA approved source of supply and certified depot for the AN/UYQ-70(V) weapon
system. NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications,
etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition; however NAVSUP WSS has requested Lockheed Martin to provide detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts. Upon receipt of this data it will be reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community, which will allow the NAVSUP WSS to properly breakout parts without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. This review is expected to take up to a year due to the range of the items in the AN/UYQ-70(V) product line. -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This announcement serves as a Sources Sought synopsis issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. This Sources Sought is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation nor is this notice a request for quotation. DO NOT submit a quote or proposal in response to this synopsis.
<p>The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) / PKOA, Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM, seeks potential business sources to provide a magnetic tape recovery system. The AFNWC/PKOA reserves the right to determine if a SB set-aside is appropriate. Additionally, we reserve the right to determine if one of the targeted socio-economic is appropriate for a set-aside based on responses to this notice and other pertinent information gathered by the contracting officer. In order for the AFNWC/PKOA to make a SB set-aside determination, it is emphasized that SB concerns provide sufficient written information to indicate their capacity and capability to successfully perform and manage all the required services. Firms responding to this announcement must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address and indicate if it is a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business. The Government reserves the right to consider the acquisition for the 8(a) program based upon responses received to this sources sought announcement. <br />The proposed contract is anticipated to be a firm-fixed price contract. <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334511 (Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing), and the size standard for small business is 750 Employees. <br />The Statement of Need for this requirement is as follows:<br />The U.S. Air Force Safety Center's Mishap Analysis and Animation Facility (MAAF) is the central Air Force focal point for the extraction and analysis of recorded data from USAF aircraft following a mishap or incident. The recorded data may come from a flight data recorder (FDR), cockpit voice recorder (CVR), video tape recorder (e.g. Heads Up Display (HUD) camera), radar, telemetry and other sources. Since many USAF aircraft remain equipped with tape-based HUD cameras, FDRs and CVRs, the government requires the capability to recover data from tape recorders which have been damaged in a mishap. After an incident, the tapes may be damaged by heat, stretching, crushing, or being cut/torn into small segments. While data could be recoverable, conventional tape players do not have the ability to play small spliced tape segments (applies mainly to videotape) or sufficient adjustability to compensate for changes in tape geometry. The MAAF envisions a "breadboard" tape player that can be adjusted for tape speed, track angle (helical scan), track spacing, etc.</p>
<p>The contractor must be able to demonstrate capabilities to deliver procedures, techniques, and hardware/software to extract data from tapes and tape segments which have been recovered following a mishap. Solution shall provide MAAF personnel with the flexibility to adjust multiple "knobs" in an iterative fashion to zero in on the best possible configuration for data recovery. The contractor shall provide all necessary equipment to integrate the solution into the MAAF's existing infrastructure, including use of commodity PC computer hardware. Representative damaged tape samples shall be provided to MAAF personnel both for training and to verify functionality of the recovery equipment in the future. Specific types of tape which the solution should be able to read are:</p>
<p>VHS<br />Hi-8<br />Digital 8<br />&frac14;" (commonly found in reel-to-reel audio recorders/players) with varying track counts from two to eight<br />3.81mm (compact cassette and microcassette)</p>
<p>Source code and executables for any software developed under this contract shall be delivered with unlimited rights to the Air Force, along with documentation of the development environment used and any switches/options necessary for MAAF personnel to produce identical versions of the delivered software. The contractor shall provide on-site installation and training to MAAF personnel in the MAAF facility, along with documentation required to use the hardware, software and procedures. Training shall be hands-on for MAAF personnel and shall include the recovery of data from damaged and undamaged tape segments.<br />Interested businesses should provide the following information:<br />A. Company name, mailing address, cage code, DUNS number, point of contact (POC), POC telephone number and e- mail address.<br />B. Business size status (i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, Woman/Women Owned or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned, small business, large business, etc.).<br />C. Capability of providing qualified and experienced personnel, with SECRET clearances.<br />D. Past Performance. Do you have past performance as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a contract of similar requirement? If so, please provide the following information: Contract number, Name of Government Agency or Commercial Entity, Period of Performance, Dollar Value, Type of Contract (Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursement, etc.), and an explanation of services provided as they relate to this Statement of Need for Kirtland AFB . If your firm acted as a subcontractor or joint venture, name the prime contractor or other party, the specific work performed and percentage.<br />E. Does your company have the financial capability and financial stability, and/or adequate lines of credit to sustain and support this contract, in the event there are difficulties with invoice payments? Do you have an approved accounting system in place to adequately track expenditures? <br />F. Do you anticipate any type of teaming arrangement for this requirement? If yes, please address what kind of arrangement and what percentage of work, and type(s) of service would you perform.<br />Responses are limited to not more than 10 pages. The government will use this information, in addition to other information obtained, to determine its small business set-aside decision. Any information provided by industry to the Government is voluntary. Responses are due no later than 4:00 PM (MST) on 10 Aug 2012 via e-mail. Questions and responses should be addressed to the Primary POC SrA Rane Linton, via email, to rane.linton@kirtland.af.mil.

<DESC><br />A. General Information
<p>This is a source sought notice. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting market research to determine the range of available small business contractors capable of performing specific work requirements discussed below&nbsp;in section C. <br /><br />This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. The NRC will not pay for the information received in response to this source sought notice. If your organization has the potential capacity to perform the project requirements discussed in Section C, then your company is invited to submit a response. <br /><br />B. Project Background</p>
<p>The RADionuclide Transport and Removal and Dose Estimation (RADTRAD) code can be used to assess occupational radiation exposures, typically in the control room; to estimate site boundary doses; and to estimate dose attenuation due to modification of a facility or accident sequence. RADTRAD, originally developed using the FORTRAN 77 language, had accumulated many problematic coding issues (bugs) over years of updates, patches and modifications. In an attempt to improve RADTRAD's maintainability, remove platform and compiler dependencies, and add new features, RADTRAD was re-implemented in the JAVA language. The first JAVA-based version of RADTRAD was given version number 4.0. In addition, the old RADTRAD MS Visual Basic based graphical user interface (GUI) was replaced with Symbolic Nuclear Analysis Package (SNAP) based GUI. SNAP uses a plug-in based architecture that &lsquo;wraps' all of the interfaces to an analytical code in a special file call a "SNAP plug-in". The new RADTRAD 4.0 as well as the new SNAP-RADTRAD 4.0 plug-in were validated in 2010-2011; a draft of the new combined user, validation, and theory manual is available. Feedback from users of RADTRAD 4.0 and the new SNAP-RADTRAD 4.0 user interface lead to various bug fixes as well as code and interface improvements. These improvements are present in the current version of RADTRAD: RADTRAD 4.4.0. Currently, a version of RADTRAD 4.4.x (and its corresponding SNAP GUI) is being evaluated by our staff; however, we need further support to finalize the code and code documentation.</p>
<p>C. Project Requirements</p>
<p>The specific tasks of this requirement are: (1) to identify and resolve any issues in SNAP-RADTRAD 4.0 plug-in; (2) to Address time-step-size dependency in RADTRAD 4.0 (3) to develop new RADTRAD models that test the new features that were added to RADTRAD 4.0 and subsequently validate and verify the RADTRAD 4.0 results against an engineering mathematical calculation tool (4) to develop a combined RADTRAD 4.0 User manual, Theory manual, and V&amp;V documentation as a ready to publish NUREG/CR; and (5) to provide general support on an as-necessary basis.</p>
<p><br />D. Procurement/Contract Strategy</p>
<p>The NRC is may issue a cost plus fixed fee Request for Proposal (RFP), for an anticipated one-year base period of performance and 4 one-year option periods.</p>
<p>E. Capability Statement Requirements</p>
<p>The capability statement should at a minimum provide the following:</p>
<p>1. Your firm's capabilities and experience performing similar work as those task described in the Section C. The presentation should address corporate experience as well as personnel qualifications. In addition, the following questions shall be addressed.</p>
<p>2. Your company's business size with respect to NAICS code 541511 or a similar NAICS Code that you propose can be used for this requirement (i.e. small or other than small). If your company is a small business, what type of small business (i.e. small disadvantaged, woman, veteran, service-disabled veteran, 8(a), and HUBZone).<br />3. Does your firm provide services on the open market, GSA FSS, or on a GWAC contract?</p>
<p>All proprietary presentation information shall be marked as such. The NRC will treat such materials appropriately, and will not distribute it to, or discuss it with, any other organization. Please note that this presentation is for market research purposes only, and any information received will be used solely to make an informed acquisition decision. The NRC does reserve the right to utilize any non-proprietary technical information in the anticipated SOW or solicitation.</p>
<p>F. Submission</p>
<p>All responses to this notice should only include responses to the questions presented in this notice. Responses in this notice will not be considered by NRC in developing its acquisition strategy. Responses to this notice shall be submitted so that they are received at dominique.malone@nrc.gov, no later than the closing date for this notice. If you have any questions, please contact me at this email address or call me at (301) 492-3613. Please be advised that the NRC will not respond directly to organizations submitting information in response to this Source Sought. The information received will be used solely to make informed acquisition decisions.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Responses to this Source Sought are not offers and cannot be accepted by NRC to form a binding contract. The NRC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>

The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. <br />(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />- 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) applies to this acquisition, with the following addendum to paragraph a:<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>A. Technical Capability<br />1. Understanding of the requirement - including the following elements:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. NIOSH approved&nbsp;- Any offerings will be eliminated from further consideration if the unit is not NIOSH approved.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. MSHA approved for intrinsically safe - Any offering will be eliminated from further consideration if the unit is not NIOSH approved.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.

Belt wearable<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k. At least one year manufacturer warranty for sampling pump and charge</p>
<p>B. Price</p>
<p>The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than Factor B, Price. However, price will become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality. Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical features. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor A, and its associated sub-factors. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br /><br />The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule.</p>
<p>Sub-factor 1: UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT - The Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the product specifications. The offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in the Product specification. <br /><br />PRICE. The offeror shall complete Schedule B (Cost/Price Schedule). The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factors I, Technical (See Table 1). No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:</p>
<p>Factor A- Technical, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale</p>
<p>ADJECTIVAL DEFINITION<br /><br />Outstanding A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.<br /><br />Acceptable A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. <br /><br />Unacceptable A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>

<p><br />The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement:<br />- 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (FEB 2012)</p>
<p>52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal. <br />BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (AUG 1999) <br />(a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as "brand name or equal," the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the solicitation. <br />(b) To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must- <br />(1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; <br />(2) Clearly identify the item by- <br />(i) Brand name, if any; and <br />(ii) Make or model number; <br />(3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and <br />(4) Clearly describe any modifications the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modifications. <br />(c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. <br />(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. <br />- 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) applies to this acquisition, with the following addendum to paragraph a:<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>A. Technical Capability<br />1. Understanding of the requirement - including the following elements:</p>
<p>a. MSHA/NIOSH approved under 30 CFR part 74 - UNITS THAT ARE NOT MSHA/NIOSH APPROVED WILL BE IMMEDIATELY ELIMINATED FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION.<br />b. Part of a complete approved sampling unit including pump, sampling head assemble and filter cassette <br />c. Continuously measure and immediately display the concentrations of respirable coal mine dust in the mine atmosphere during a working shift <br />d. MRE conversion factor applicable to unit <br />e. Belt Wearable <br />f. Price</p>
<p><br />B. Price</p>
<p>The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than Factor B, Price. However, price will become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality. Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical features. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor A, and its associated sub-factors. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br /><br />The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule.</p>
<p>Sub-factor 1: UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT - The Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the product specifications. The offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in the Product specification. <br /><br />PRICE. The offeror shall complete Schedule B (Cost/Price Schedule). The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factors I, Technical (See Table 1). No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:</p>
<p>Factor A- Technical, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale</p>
<p>ADJECTIVAL DEFINITION<br /><br />Outstanding A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.<br /><br />Acceptable A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. <br /><br />Unacceptable A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>

<DESC>The National Assessment Governing Board has a requirement to conduct research to enable the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) to make valid statements about the academic preparedness of 12th grade students in reading and mathematics for job training. The objective of this procurement is to seek proposals for research studies that are feasible and that include study designs. Proposed budgets to carry out the research need to be submitted as well. The objective of the research is to identify locations on the 12th grade NAEP reading and mathematics scales that represent the knowledge and skills to qualify for training in various occupations. Reporting on academic preparedness for college and job training is a challenging and important new direction for NAEP.
<p><br />The National Assessment Governing Board oversees and sets policy for NAEP. The Governing Board set out on this path to report on academic preparedness for college and job training following acceptance of a report from a blue ribbon commission in 2004. Among its recommendations, the commission called on NAEP to be transformed to report on the academic preparedness of 12th grade students for college, job training, and the military.</p>
<p>Clarification questions on the Request for Proposals (RFP) are due on Friday, August 10, 2012, no later than 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET), as noted in the RFP (see Attachment -- SF 33, page 75). Proposal submissions are due no later than September 4, 2012 at 10:00 a.m. ET. All communications with respect to the RFP are required to be in writing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span>.</p>
<p>Information on the work of the National Assessment Governing Board, and the Governing Board's 12th grade research studies conducted to date can be found at www.nagb.gov.</p>

Project Details 
The Segmented Mirror Telescope (SMT) is a research instrument located at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, CA.  The telescope was commissioned by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to evaluate emerging technologies involving the fabrication of lightweight mirrors.
  The SMT consists of six hexagonal 1.2m segments arranged to form a 3m total aperture. The segments offer an alternative to traditional glass segments.  Fabricated from a lightweighted silicon carbide substrate, the segments have a nanolamiate foil attached to them, forming the optical surface. The fabrication process produces a lightweight and rigid (stiff) structure while substantially reducing overall production time.  Electrostrictive actuators attached to the substrate provide active surface figure control, allowing for low spatial frequency corrections. 
The NPS acquired the SMT in November, 2009.  The telescope was restored to its operational configuration using updated coarse and fine control actuators.
 The telescope is currently oriented in the horizontal configuration with the primary optical axis pointing towards the horizon.   
Currently, high spatial frequencies inherent to the primary segments limit overall image resolution. The limited range and number of the electrostrictive actuators prevents a high quality image from forming at the focal plane.  A straightforward solution to improving overall image quality involves implementation of a deformable mirror (DM) along the optical path.  The DM would work in tandem with the active primary segments providing a “woofer- tweeter” integrated wavefront control system. In this configuration the active primary would correct the low spatial frequencies while the adaptive DM would correct the high spatial frequencies.
 
 SCOPE 
The contractor shall be responsible to provide technical support in the areas of Control Systems, Optics, and Electro-Optics.  Support is to be provided via telephone, email, and remote conferencing. Support is to be requested by the Government Technical POC (TPOC) defining specific tasks for the contractor.  These tasks will require detailed discussions and transfer of technical data and files to relay the relevant information between the Government and Contractor.

Naval Postgraduate School
Engineering Consultant Support for the Preliminary Design Review for the Navy’s Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS)  

Organization
The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Located in Monterey, California supports the U.S.
 Navy, other military branches, and foreign military services with postgraduate education for personnel.  Additionally NPS provides significant research and consulting capabilities to the Department of the Navy (DoN) and for the Department of Defense (DoD).  The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) provides graduate level education, research, and consulting and advising support for many DoN/DoD activities on a wide range of platforms and weapons systems. 

Background
A request to the MAE Department was made by the Program Executive Office for Ships in the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) PMS495 to help support the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) of the Navy’s Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS).
  The MAE Department is supporting the ongoing PDR with some organic capabilities, but additional expertise is required as outlined in our proposal to support NPS with the PDR assessment. Therefore the services of a senior engineering consultant are required as we continue to review the design, provide feedback to NAVSEA on ways to improve the system’s performance and reliability.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: The award decision will be based on the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable offer.  Best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price."<br><br> (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br><br>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br><br>(End of provision)<br><br><br>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2<br><br>Paragraph (a) is hereby supplemented with the following:<br><br> (a).  The total evaluated price must be reasonable, and any additional expense must be justified by a corresponding value for technical merit, or an expectation of greater quality of performance.  <br><br>(b).   Contractors may not qualify if any of the following are not met: <br><br>1.   	Proposal does not reasonably address the requirements in the request for proposal (RFP).<br>2.	Proposal includes major deficiencies or omissions which discussions could not be expected to cure without a major revision or a new proposal.<br><br>3.	Proposal is so technically inferior or so out of line in price as compared to other proposals as to preclude it from having a reasonable chance for award.<br><br>4. 	An unrealistically low price, may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement for the geographic area of service, or unbalanced pricing of line items, as proposed initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an imprudent offer.<br>5.   The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if necessary.<br><br><br>PART I    TECHINICAL:<br><br>Technical capability to include product literature, catalog price lists if available; warranty, guarantee, technical specs, and  delivery information.<br><br>Technical will be evaluated as either Acceptable or Unacceptable. Best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.<br><br>Definitions are as follows: <br><br>ACCEPTABLE: To be rated acceptable, the offeror's technical proposal must demonstrate it can meet all requirements. <br><br>UNACCEPTABLE: A technical proposal that fails to demonstrate it can meet one or more requirements will be determined unacceptable. <br><br><br>PART II   PAST PERFORMANCE<br><br>Offeror is required to submit information, on a single page, identifying federal, state and local Government and private contracts performed within the past three years, which are similar in  scope and complexity to the effort described in this solicitation.  If none, offeror should so state and provide information on references.<br><br>Information provided by the Contractor shall state:  The type of service provided with information to verify references:  Names; telephone numbers; Points of Contact; amount of contract; and email addresses.<br><br>Past performance shall be used as an evaluation factor within the LPTA process, unless waived by the PCO in accordance with FAR 15.101- 2(b). It shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305 and DFARS 215.305.  However, the comparative assessment in FAR 15.305(a)(2)(i) does not apply.  Therefore, past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis using the ratings below.<br><br>Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br><br>Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br><br>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability,<br>"unknown" shall be considered "acceptable." A.2.1.2.1 Aspects of Past Performance.<br><br>PART III    PRICE:<br><br>Price will be evaluated separately from Technical and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability. <br>Offeror shall provide their published price list with their offer. <br><br><br><br>52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEB 2012) ALTERNATE I (APR 2011)<br><br><br>Vendors shall include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications with their offer. Offerors shall include a confirmation of receipt of any amendments to this solicitation. Failure to submit a confirmation could result in the offer being determined non- responsive.<br><br>
