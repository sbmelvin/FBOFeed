<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) China Lake, CA intends to procure on a sole source basis, a Parts Obsolescence Management capability for the Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures (IDECM) program.  The requirement includes constantly updating the database and providing recommended alternatives, called solution sets, to parts that have been identified as obsolete or that will become obsolete.  This capability consists of maintaining a database of vendors capable of providing parts to the various components of the IDECM program, and of providing a Website that presents this information to the government and the IDECM subcontractors.  The IDECM program is experiencing a parts obsolescence problem and requires a proactive, systematic approach to finding and maintaining a database of vendors capable of providing the parts.  Technology advances and changes to program requirements have created the parts obsolescence problem and only an organized and efficient database system can track the very diverse IDECM program components and their numerous vendors.  Over the last 25 years, Raytheon Technical Services (RTS) has developed the unique technical expertise, points of contact, and the ability to research and make recommendations on alternatives to use when a specific vendor is no longer able to provide a required part.  This full-service capability for the IDECM program is unique to RTS because of the contacts they have made and the Non-Disclosure Agreements they have negotiated with the IDECM contractors.  RTS's knowledge of the IDECM program, and their relationships with vendors acquired over the last 25 years, guarantees the database will be updated whenever new information becomes available.  Quantity is approximately 903 hours per year for one basic year, plus two option years.  See Note 22.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 7/26/02 and will be available through the 2.0 Contracts Competency home page at:  https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS KEESLER AFB BASE OPERATING SUPPORT (BOS) A-76 COST STUDY, PICK-A-BASE.  The information provided is the planned strategy at this time.  The strategy for this acquisition may change prior to final RFP release.  We are seeking qualified large and small businesses, 8(a) concerns, SDB contractors, historically underutilized businesses, women-owned businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions under NAICS Code 561210 (Size Standard $23 million) to participate in this Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 Cost Comparison study.  The study will consist of looking at all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform seventeen selected service functions, identified below, for the 81st Training Wing at Keesler AFB, MSThis request for proposals is part of a Government cost comparison study pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, as implemented by FAR 52.207-2, the OMB A-76 Revised Supplemental Handbook, and Air Force Instruction 38-203, Commercial Activities Program.  This study is conducted to determine whether accomplishing the specified work under contract (private) or by in-house (public) performance is more economical.  If in-house performance is determined to be more economical, this request for proposals will be canceled and no contract will be awarded.  There will be two steps leading to the determination to either award a contract or retain the requirement for in-house performance.  The first step is the selection of the best value contractor?s proposal to compare with the in-house cost estimate.  The second step is the comparison of the best value proposal and in-house cost estimate with a final decision to either award a contract or retain the work for Government performance.  AETC is considering setting aside for small business several of the functions (Little BOS), in which case a separate award would be made to a small business firm for these areas, with the remaining functions falling under a separate contract award (Big BOS).  Two separate Government bids will be prepared, one representing the Big BOS areas and the second representing the Little BOS areas. There are four possible award scenarios:  Both Big BOS and Little BOS may go contract, both Big BOS and Little BOS may remain in-house, Big BOS may be contracted out while Little BOS remains in-house, or Big BOS may remain in-house while Little BOS is contracted out.  THIS COST STUDY WILL NOT RESULT IN A CONTRACT AWARD IF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE IS CONSIDERED MORE ADVANTAGEOUS.  The Big BOS includes service areas 1 ?14 (listed below) and the Little BOS includes service areas 15-17.  The functional groupings to support the infrastructure at Keesler AFB are defined as follows:  (PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE AREAS MAY NOT BE ALL ENCOMPASSING)  1)  Space Management ? space use surveys, needs assessment and requirements validation, assessment of allocation and the preparation of reallocation proposals to ensure efficient and adequate use of facilities  2)  Grounds and Site Maintenance ? grounds maintenance, entomology services, and roadway construction and maintenance  3)  Operations and Maintenance ? work order management, airfield maintenance, housing maintenance, building services requests, and industrial utilities maintenance  4)  Environmental ? hazmat, asbestos/lead-based paint program management, disposal of all hazardous waste on base  5)  Energy and Utilities Management ? purchasing, peak load shaping and total costs associated with the operation and maintenance of a co-generation plant and back-up generation, water and sewage distribution systems, electrical distribution, street light maintenance, traffic signal maintenance, energy monitoring and control systems, hospital back-up generation  6)  Engineering Services ? facilities planning, project design, and construction management  7)  Emergency Management ? simulation exercise, shelters, emergency response team, unit disaster preparedness programs, disaster preparedness briefing training, and writing and validating emergency response plans  8)  Housing ? ensuring adequate housing, budgeting, housing assignments for stationed personnel, quality assurance of quarters offered  9)  Resource Management ? preparing budget reports, base real property management, maintaining records for charge-back system  10)  Supply Services ? procurement, warehousing and demand forecasting services for supplies, equipment, munitions and fuels on base, ordering, receiving and storing additional units of supply  11)  Airfield Support Services ? management of airfield facilities (runway maintenance, runway markings, barrier maintenance, lights, signs), purchase and maintenance of aircraft support equipment, weather personnel, crash recovery support, life support, AGE maintenance and transient alert  12)  Human Resources ? training related to corporate policy, maintenance of military personnel records, tuition assistance management, counseling personnel on education, coordination of professional military education  13)  Marketing and Publicity ? development and implementation of non-sponsored and commercially sponsored promotions for Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) and other organization, formulation and implementation of marketing plans intended for both internal and external markets  14)  Community Services ? providing indoor and outdoor recreational facilities, fitness and athletic programs, a full service library, and automotive repair instruction  15)  Communications and Information Technology ? application development, application support, cable management, email, troubleshooting down to desktop, managing FSA and WAN, AFCERTS, BTS  16)  Visual Information Services ? production of high quality of visual graphics, still photography, video-teleconferencing, satellite video broadcasts worldwide, video production for classroom and public affairs equipment loan/checkout/setup/operation  17)  Publishing Management ? analysis, design, production, standardization and maintenance of publications and forms

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS KEESLER AFB BASE OPERATING SUPPORT (BOS) A-76 COST STUDY, PICK-A-BASE.  The information provided is the planned strategy at this time.  The strategy for this acquisition may change prior to final RFP release.  We are seeking qualified large and small businesses, 8(a) concerns, SDB contractors, historically underutilized businesses, women-owned businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions under NAICS Code 561210 (Size Standard $23 million) to participate in this Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 Cost Comparison study.  The study will consist of looking at all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform seventeen selected service functions, identified below, for the 81st Training Wing at Keesler AFB, MSThis request for proposals is part of a Government cost comparison study pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, as implemented by FAR 52.207-2, the OMB A-76 Revised Supplemental Handbook, and Air Force Instruction 38-203, Commercial Activities Program.  This study is conducted to determine whether accomplishing the specified work under contract (private) or by in-house (public) performance is more economical.  If in-house performance is determined to be more economical, this request for proposals will be canceled and no contract will be awarded.  There will be two steps leading to the determination to either award a contract or retain the requirement for in-house performance.  The first step is the selection of the best value contractor?s proposal to compare with the in-house cost estimate.  The second step is the comparison of the best value proposal and in-house cost estimate with a final decision to either award a contract or retain the work for Government performance.  AETC is considering setting aside for small business several of the functions (Little BOS), in which case a separate award would be made to a small business firm for these areas, with the remaining functions falling under a separate contract award (Big BOS).  Two separate Government bids will be prepared, one representing the Big BOS areas and the second representing the Little BOS areas. There are four possible award scenarios:  Both Big BOS and Little BOS may go contract, both Big BOS and Little BOS may remain in-house, Big BOS may be contracted out while Little BOS remains in-house, or Big BOS may remain in-house while Little BOS is contracted out.  THIS COST STUDY WILL NOT RESULT IN A CONTRACT AWARD IF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE IS CONSIDERED MORE ADVANTAGEOUS.  The Big BOS includes service areas 1 ?14 (listed below) and the Little BOS includes service areas 15-17.

<DESC>Applications of the Technology
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has developed a simplified optical 
scanning method to determine the location of points on an object's surface 
through the variation of illuminated pixels directed to the object's 
surface. An illumination source, an optical light intensity modulator, 
a light detector, and a computer or dedicated firmware for controlling pixel intensities and for implementing the algorithm are the tools needed to employ the method developed at LANL.

Using the reflected illumination as detected by an image received (such as a CCD camera), the method determines the position of points on the surface of the object by detecting the modulation of illumination of pixels after they pass through an intensity modulator (such as an LCD).  This process is controlled by the algorithm described herein.  

Advantages 
The advantages of this digitized method over status quo means to determine 
points on an object's surface are several.  The fundamental advantage of the technique is its computational simplicity which in turn allows for speed and accuracy. The computation of the data provides for the generation OF real time identification of points on an object's surface. Additionally, many status quo methods for digitizing the points on an object's surface for measurement and comparison work requires the object or 
part being studied to be painted. The LANL method avoids this step 
altogether. Objects being studied using the LANL method do not have to be 
painted in order for the data regarding an object's surface points to be 
digitized.

Users of the Technology
Parties who might have an interest in this technology include those in the automobile and truck industry for use in the optical scanning of parts.  The entertainment industry would also find this method extremely useful to quickly digitize a model that needs to be scaled up for use in movie-making and other entertainment applications.  The method can be employed by any party trying to compare objects or parts for uniformity.  The method can also be used to detect defects in an object?s surface.  

Status
LANL is seeking interested parties to license the technology or to collaborate with LANL researchers on further development of the technique.  Such parties need to have an understanding of optical scanning methods and principles.  Letters of interest from such parties regarding the above technology should be directed to the point of contact below no later than August 23, 2002.  

A United States Patent issued on this technology on April 9, 2002,  U.S. Patent Number 6,369,879 (DOE Reference Number S-94,778).  An application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) has been filed on this technology to preserve foreign rights.  Such rights are available to the extent a licensee wishes to cover the costs of any National Phase patent filings.

The study would also recommend a legal strategy for allowing a percentage of collected tax revenues to be used to compensate the concessionaire.

The Bureau of Internal Revenue is a component agency of the Department of Finance that is responsible for the collection of tax revenues throughout the Philippines.  BIR is seeking to outsource its IT infrastructure and at the same time to complete IT infrastructure roll-out on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis.

2.	Determine the technical requirements of the Project;
3.	Clarify the legal/regulatory framework of the Project;
4.	Determine the financial viability of the Project;
5.	Provide assistance to BIR in developing an economic justification (?business case?) for presentation to the Legislature;
6.	Determine the organizational impact of the Project;  
7.	Recommend an appropriate contractual structure and implementation mode for the Project; 
8.	Prepare tender documents for open, competitive tendering of the Project, and provide guidance and assistance to the Bureau in the bid solicitation and evaluation stages.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $584,100 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.

Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

(2) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%): In the Lead Designer's words, (maximum of two typewritten pages)  state his/her overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply in creating a state-of-the art headquarters office building in an urban neighborhood environment.

GOVERNMENT DEBT ISSUANCE AND MANAGEMENT ADVISORS 
EMERGING MARKETS _ WORLDWIDE 

The U.S. Treasury Department provides technical assistance and policy advice to senior government and central bank officials and market participants in nearly 30 countries. We are recruiting candidates for positions as resident (long-term) and intermittent (short-term) advisors in government debt issuance and management in countries throughout the world, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Southeast and Central Asia, Latin America, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. This recruitment is for global assignments and significant international travel is required.

For resident (long-term) assignments, we seek experts in domestic government securities issuance and management. Experience in international bond markets is highly desirable. Applicants for resident assignments ideally should have a combination of public and private sector experience in government debt management, investment banking or financial advisory work. For intermittent (short-term) assignments, we are seeking advisors with particular expertise in: liability management policy and procedures; legal framework for government securities; market regulation; custody, clearing and settlement; fixed income trading; treasury operations; and mortgage and other asset-backed finance. For all positions, management experience is desired. Prior overseas work experience in challenging environments is a distinct advantage. Foreign language skills are highly desirable. While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of host government officials and provide sound but realistic advice to a sovereign government in an emerging market environment will determine ultimate success.   Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.

SALARY AND BENEFITS: Salaries are negotiated in accordance with program regulations, based on demonstrated salary history and the skills required. The salary range is between $85,000 to $130,000.

<DESC>The MC2A is the key piece of the MC2 Constellation that will extend the commanders eyes and ears while serving as the primary element of the C2 architecture.  The first increment of MC2A will utilize an MP-RTIP radar on a 767-400ER with a BMC4I suite that provides initial battle management capability to include ground moving target indicator missions, Cruise Missile Defense, UAV control, and time critical targeting in support of the Air Operations Center.  The second increment is planned to add Airborne Early Warning and Control capabilities.  The MC2A will be fully integrated within the architecture of joint combat and ISR systems, space-based systems, and all-source intelligence exploitation systems to achieve the highest predictive battlespace awareness. The BMC4I subsystem consists of all of the non-radar and non-aircraft subsystems including the central computing architecture, networks, data storage, data manipulation, data fusion, data exploitation, communications and data link capability. The MC2A BMC4I contractor will provide improvements in the quality and timeliness of information to support more rapid decision analysis, increased battlespace awareness, and shorter decision cycle to advance information superiority and precision engagement. The contractor will also support the development of training merging airborne and ground battle management functions to minimize the training burden on the operators.  The MC2A BMC4I subsystem will allow for future capability growth, utilize Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) to the maximum extent possible, be Common Operating Environment (COE) compliant and utilize open systems architecture to achieve the highest levels of systems interoperability.  It will handle data at multiple levels of security and will fuse on and off board data to create a common operational picture.

Attachment A
Solicitation  GS06P02GYC0050

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.  The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a contract to Data Computer Corporation of America (DCCA) on a sole source basis using the Federal Supply Service Information Technology Schedule.  CMS maintains an enrollment database (EDB) containing records of all beneficiaries ever entitled to Medicare.  The EDB contains beneficiary identifying information, Medicare Part A and B entitlement dates, demographic data information, Medicare managed care enrollment information, direct billing information, third party payer information, and data identifying the reason for Medicare entitlement.  The implementation of the new Direct Billing System (DBS) was effective August 30, 1996.  As part of that redesign, the EDB began housing data for those beneficiaries who are being directly billed.  Current efforts will build on the EDB to satisfy additional user requirements and legislative requirements for enrollment, entitlement and direct billing processes.  In addition, efforts to streamline those processes and provide support for other DBS applications will be done simultaneously.  DCCA is currently providing routine maintenance support and the continued updating support of the ongoing operational functionalities of the Enrollment Database, Direct Billing System and Third Party System to accommodate legislative and regulatory changes.  DCCA has begun to convert the large EDB from a Model 204 environment to a DB2 environment. This contract will be awarded on a sole source basis, using the Federal Supply Service Information Technology Schedule, to DCCA as they have been solely responsible for the conversion since June 2001. The contract will also include maintenance support for all of the current M204 systems of this database and the conversion of those systems.  This contract will be awarded for a period of 26 months.  Contracting for the conversion and maintenance services is an interim strategy not expected to exceed July 31, 2004. It is being done to ensure maximum results in the development and integration of these two databases, to ultimately form one, until the MBD2 is complete and fully implemented.

<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offers (RFO) for the addition to the Child Care Center on Stennis Space Center, MS. The work for this requirement consists of, but is not limited to the following: Provide all labor, equipment, tools and materials to provide an addition of approximately 4,400 square feet to the existing structure and modification to the interior of the existing spaces.  The addition consists of site work, a concrete slab on grade, wood framing with brick veneer, wood trust roof framing, plywood decking and asphalt shingles. Interior furnishings include gypsum board partitions, painting, carpeting, plumbing, HVAC and a sprinkler system.  Electrically the project provides for a new electrical service to the building, lighting and outlets. Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government.  BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts).  However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.  Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so. The order of magnitude for the procurement is $500,000 to $1,000,000, and the effort shall be completed within (240) calendar days after receipt of the notice to proceed.  This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  As a result, all qualified responsible sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 234990 and $28.5 million, respectively.  The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about Aug 1, 2002, with an anticipated bid closing date of on or about Sep 3, 2002. The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO.   An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  Specifications and Drawings will only be made available on CDROM. Requests for copies shall be made by email to the Bid Distribution Office: jason.edge@ssc.nasa.gov or you may fax your request to (228) 688-1141.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet. These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or  URL, for the NASA/SSC Business Opportunities page is http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=64  Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.

(b) Basis of Evaluation:  Evaluation of this factor will be based on a subjective assessment of the Offeror?s past performance, experience, and safety record.  In evaluating past performance, experience, and safety, the Government may consider information included in the Offeror?s proposal, information obtained from past and present customers, other Government agencies, and Government databases, and information obtained by any other source deemed necessary by the Government.  The failure to provide requested data, to provide a point of contact (POC) that is accessible, or providing an incorrect phone number, etc could result in a lower rating.  The Government will not be obligated to seek to discover or investigate a resolution for incomplete or incorrect information.

The evaluation of the Offeror?s past performance will consider whether the Offeror has consistently demonstrated quality work, including the Offeror?s record of conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship; record of recommending and/or implementing innovative approaches and/or technologies; adherence to schedules; and history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction.  The evaluation of the Offeror?s experience will consider the Offeror?s depth of relevant experience in the construction of projects that are similar in scope, size, and complexity to that described herein.  Higher ratings may be given to those Offerors with similar project experience and favorable past performance ratings on previous Navy Exchange projects.  Projects with more recent completion dates, that demonstrate relevancy to this project, may receive higher ratings.  The evaluation of the Offeror?s safety record will consider the Offeror?s OSHA Form 200 Log, EMR, and MIR.  Higher ratings may be given to those Offerors with EMRs less than 1.0 and MIRs less than 3.0.

<DESC>///////ATTENTION:THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS SUPERCEDES THE PRIOR POSTING////// This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to determine potential sources capable of designing, developing, integrating, and testing a Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) subsystem for the Multi-Sensor Command and Control Aircraft (MC2A) weapon system. The MC2A is the key piece of the MC2 Constellation that will extend the commander's eyes and ears while serving as the primary element of the C2 architecture.  The first increment of MC2A will utilize an MP-RTIP radar on a 767-400ER with a BMC4I suite that provides initial battle management capability to include ground moving target indicator missions, Cruise Missile Defense, UAV control, and time critical targeting in support of the Air Operations Center.  The second increment is planned to add Airborne Early Warning and Control capabilities.  The MC2A will be fully integrated within the architecture of joint combat and ISR systems, space-based systems, and all-source intelligence exploitation systems to achieve the highest predictive battlespace awareness. The BMC4I subsystem consists of all of the non-radar and non-aircraft subsystems including the central computing architecture, networks, data storage, data manipulation, data fusion, data exploitation, communications and data link capability. The MC2A BMC4I contractor will provide improvements in the quality and timeliness of information to support more rapid decision analysis, increased battlespace awareness, and shorter decision cycle to advance information superiority and precision engagement. The contractor will also support the development of training merging airborne and ground battle management functions to minimize the training burden on the operators. The MC2A BMC4I subsystem will allow for future capability growth, utilize Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) to the maximum extent possible, be Common Operating Environment (COE) compliant and utilize open systems architecture to achieve the highest levels of systems interoperability. It will handle data at multiple levels of security and will fuse on and off board data to create a common operational picture. The purpose of this announcement is to help the government mitigate program cost, schedule and performance risks by identifying potential highly competitive firms for the MC2A BMC4I contract.  This announcement will also help interested offerors make a more informed decision of their probability of success and determine whether or not they should proceed with a full proposal effort. Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought request.  The Government requests interested offerors submit a statement of their qualifications with respect to the key features discussed above and the screening criteria below. Responses should include examples of systems successfully developed.  The Government expects that interested sources, either alone or with appropriate teaming partners, should meet the following criteria: (1) Possess or have the ability to obtain a U. S. Top Secret level facility security clearance, as well as provide a facility built to DCID 1/21 standards for the design, development, integration, and test efforts.

A/E contractors will only have to provide this information once with annual updates or as key company information changes occur.  Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.acq.mil/ec; through any DOD Certified Value Added Network; or a paper may be obtained by calling the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Advanced Technology Center plans to procure from Beckman Coulter, 4300 N. Harbor Blvd., Fullerton, CA 92834 for a Multimek Automated Pipettor 384.  The NCI's Advanced Technology Center's mission and goals are to increase the volume of array production within the ATC.  Microarray experiments require instrumentation that can be used for microplate replication, reagent setup/additions, PCR setup, full-plate serial dilutions and plate consolidations.  The Multimek 384-Pipettor is essential for this process and is interchangeable with the Biomek FX which is already in place at the ATC.  The 834-channel head pipettes from 1-30 ul and the pneumatic tip loading give the instrument increased reliability which is essential for research in Microarray technologies.  There is only one instrument known to the government that can handle 384 samples automatically using existing microplates within the ATC.  The Multimek Automated Pipettor is the only instrument known to the Government that is compatible with existing equipment.  This is not a request for competitive quotations, however, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  This statement must demonstrate that an alternate system provided will be equivalent in quality, function and compatibility.  The statement and any other supporting documentation must be furnished in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party meets the requirement.  Information must be received in the contracting office no later than 1:30 P.M. EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on July 18, 2002.  If you have further questions please contact Cynthia Brown, (301) 402-4509. The NAICS Code 334516 and the business size standard are 500 employees.

The contract may include options for up to 3 additional weeks.  Although it is preferred that the vessel be able to transport all personnel on a single run, the Government may allow for staggered departures /arrivals if the proposed vessel(s) will not accommodate all personnel in a single run.  Due to scheduling issues, the Government will not allow for a single ferry making multiple runs each morning and afternoon.  A transit time of 1-hour and 40-minutes or less is required.  The proposed vessel must be in compliance with the Jones Act, (i.e. an U.S. Flag vessel manufactured in the United States).  This acquisition will be solicited using the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Additionally, the acquisition will be solicited as 100% small business set-aside.

When issued, the RFQ will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) web link at www.neco.navy.mil.  All firms wishing to submit an quote are responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFQ from this website (WinZIP or equivalent is required), and to frequently monitor that site for any amendments to the RFQ.  No telephone or fax requests for the RFQ package will be accepted.  An email request to julie_a_thomas@puget.fisc.navy.mil will be accepted in the event that a firm experiences problems downloading the RFQ from the NECO website.  The Government is not responsible for any inability of the firm to access the posted documents.  This office will not maintain a bidder's mailing list.  No paper copies of the RFQ and/or amendments will be mailed.  Failure to respond to electronically posted RFQs and associated amendments prior to the date and time set for receipt of quotes may render your quote nonresponsive and result in the rejection of same.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Advanced Technology Center plans to procure from Gene Machines, 935 Washington Street, San Carlos, CA 94070 for an Automated Plate Loading System for an Omnigrid Arrayer.  The NCI's Advanced Technolgy Center's mission and goals are the manufactureing of quality microarrays for comprehensive gene expression analysis, provide training protocols and technical support to NCI researchers and develop new microarray technologies and applications.  High density DNA micro-array technology has been used to achieve high throughput analysis of massively parallel genomic sequences.  These high density DNA microarrays will be and have been used to perform expression studies, re-sequencing experiments, and genotype analysis on human, mouse, and other organisms.  The Automated Plate Loading System is required to increase the throughput and to speed the array production.  Without this system only a few plates can be handled at a time and larger arrays would not be possible. The Automated Plate Loading System is the only equipment known to the Government that is compatible with existing Omnigrid units. This is not a request for competitive quotations, however, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statment.  This statement must demonstrate that an alternate system provided will be equivalent in quality, function and compatibility.  The statement and any other supporting documentation must be furnished in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party meets the requirement.  Information must be received in the contracting office no later than 1:30 P.M. EDT(Local Washington, D.C. time) on July 18, 2002.  If you have further questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent (301) 402-4509.  The NAICS Code 334616 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

An offeror may respond to either Part A, Part B, or Part C, or may submit proposals for any combination of two or three parts.  It is anticipated that one (1) to four (4) cost-reimbursement, completion-type contracts will awarded for a period of seven (7) years. 

Part A will focus on the conduct of assays for viral (SIV, HIV, SHIV) antigen-specific cellular immune responses, such as ELISPOT,  Intracellular Cytokine Staining,  CTL, and T cell proliferation  assays. 

Part B will focus on the conduct of  viral (SIV, HIV, and SHIV) neutralization assays, with an increasing focus on assays able to assess the ability of sera to neutralize infection with primary isolates of  HIV-1.

Part C will focus on the conduct of assays to quantitatively measure, with a high degree of sensitivity and accuracy, the plasma levels of SIV, SHIV, or HIV viral RNA in infected non-human primates.  

Contractors for each Part A, B, and C will be expected to continue to develop and improve assays in order to maintain a state-of-the-art capability in each area.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration plans to award single source contracts to ACS, NACI, SOHAR and Thane for technical evaluation services under the Next Generation Communication (NEXCOM) Rapid Preliminary Design Effort (RPDE) and UHF Radio Screening Information Requests (SIRs).  Each of these contractors had provided technical services to the RPDE and UHF Radio acquisition teams as subcontractors to the FAAs Technical Assistance Contractor, TRW.  The FAA is severing its contractual obligation for these services from TRW because of an apparent organizational conflict of interest resulting from the recently announced acquisition of TRW by Northrop Grumman.  Each vendor has obtained a detailed knowledge of the requirements related to the RPDE and UHF Radio acquisitions.  The time required to complete a competitive acquisition for the technical evaluation services would likely delay award of the contracts for RPDE and UHF Radios and increase costs to the FAA.  The period!  of performance for these services will extend through the evaluation and an initial period following award of the RPDE and UHF Radio contracts.   <P> The approximate value of the contracts is as follows: <P> ACS     $ 81,605 NACI    $ 69,409 SOHAR   $ 13,315 Thane   $ 56,355 <P>

<DESC>The General Services Administration has a requirement to provide for the phased removal and disposal of twenty two (22) PCB contaminated 15 KV transformers and the installation of eleven (11) new 15 KV transformers, including associated primary disconnects, at the J.W. Powell Building, Reston, VA.  Removal of existing transformers and installation of new transformers requires selective demolition of building components, including but not limited to louver assemblies, etc.  Temporary shoring and/or load spreading structural steel will be required.  Sealing of PCB contaminated floor slabs and concrete will be required.  The Government will occupy the site and the existing building during the entire period of construction.  The Estimated Cost Range:  $1 million to $2 million.  The Performance Period is 365 calendar days from Notice to Proceed. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 235310; Size Standard is $12.0 million. The Contractor shall perform on the site, and with its own organization, work equivalent to at least twelve percent (12%) of the total amount of work to be performed under the contract.   The Government intends to procure this requirement through the two-step sealed bidding process.  Step One consists of the Request for Qualifications (RFQ).  No pricing or pricing information shall be included in Step One. Only one technical proposal may be submitted by each offeror.   Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information.  The Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the proposal as submitted.  The Government may proceed with the second step without requesting further information from any offeror; however, the Government may request additional information from offerors of proposals that it considers reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable, and may discuss proposals with their offerors.  A notice of unacceptability will be forwarded to the offeror upon completion of the proposal evaluation and final determination of unacceptability.  Upon completion of the pre-qualification process under Step One, all qualified contractors will receive the Invitation for Bids (IFB), including contract drawings and specifications.  Step Two involves the submission of a Firm Fixed, sealed, lump sum bid.  Only bids based upon technical proposals determined to be acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award.  Each bid in the second step must be based on the bidder's own technical proposals.  The low bidder for the purpose of award is the responsible bidder offering the lowest price for the base bid (consisting of the lump sum bid and any associated unit price bids extended by the applicable number of units shown on the bid form).  Step One - Technical Qualifications submittal shall include the following evaluation factors:  (A) Past Performance.  Submit three (3) prime project examples completed during the past five (5) years comparable in nature, type and complexity.  [Contracts listed may include those entered into by the federal government, agencies of state or local municipalities and commercial customers].  Give project title, location and reference who may be contacted regarding the quality of your performance. Indicate name, title, company name, current company address, and phone number of each reference.  This factor is evaluated as Go/No Go.  Past performance on comparable contracts is -GO- when (a) the majority of references indicate that they would definitely contract with the offeror again; and (b) the contractor must have completed its work in accordance with contract requirements.  (B) Technical Experience.  Demonstrate specialized technical experience for each of the following categories:  (1) PCB Removal and Disposal.  (2) Electrical installation, including High Voltage, Transformers, and Circuit Breakers.  (3)  Refurbishment work in critical operational facilities.  (4) Removal and Disposal of Lead Based Paint.  For each category, submit one project example completed during the past ten (10) years. [Contracts listed may include those entered into by the federal government, agencies of state or local municipalities and commercial customers].  Give project title, location and reference who may be contacted for validation of technical experience.  Indicate name, title, company name, current company address, and phone number of each reference.  This factor is evaluated as Go/No Go.  Technical Experience is -GO- when (a) the project submitted in each category is validated and (b) the contractor must have completed its work in accordance with contract requirements.  The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Emergency Training Center (NETC), Emergency Management Institute (EMI) has an Emergency Management Higher Education project/requirement for development of an "Electronic Textbook. This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The associated NAICS code is 611430,Professional Development Training, and the small business size standard is $6.0 million [average annual receipts for three preceding fiscal years]. The goal of this requirement is to encourage and support the expansion of hazard, disaster and emergency management related education in colleges and universities across the United States so that in the future more emergency management and related personnel in government and in the private sector will come to the job not only with a college education, but with a course of study in emergency management as well.  This will help to contribute to the professionalism of emergency management and the expansion of emergency management knowledge and principles into other professions and disciplines as well, all of which contributes to building disaster-resistant and resilient communities of tomorrow. Toward that end, EMI, located at the NETC in Emmitsburg, Maryland, developed the Higher Education Project, the primary purpose of which is to encourage and support the development of hazard, disaster and emergency management bachelor and graduate degree programs within United States colleges and universities. Each Emergency Management Higher Education Project course or textbook shall be developed within the philosophical context of (1) building disaster resistant and resilient communities, and (2) seeking balance between the technocratic and the social vulnerability reduction approaches to emergency management.  Please refer to the Higher Education Project Slide Presentation at the following website address: http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/hihgedbrief/course2.ppt
Course developers shall be college/university faculty with doctoral credentials and upper division college-level teaching experience, as well as emergency management and/or disaster field research experience.  Emphasis shall be placed on the practical application of knowledge gained by federal and state agencies and organizations responsible for assisting local governments with recovery and the actions taken at the local level following disasters. The textbook will be developed so that it can be used within an emergency management major certificate program to students who may someday enter an emergency management related profession. The textbook will need to contain more material than can be used in a standard 45 contact-hour course in order to provide flexibility to the user. The textbook should: 1) Expand the knowledge base of future and practicing emergency managers in the fundamental, principles, and practice of U.S. emergency management; 2) Fill the current void in the availability of an up-to-date and adequate basic text to support the explosion of emergency management and related courses that is taking place on college campuses across the country; and 3) Facilitate the continued expansion of emergency management courses on college campuses and their outreach to future and practicing emergency managers. Since all deliverables shall be provided in hard-copy and in electronic format for distribution via the Internet, all deliverables shall be Section 508 compliant. Award of a firm-fixed-price purchase order is anticipated.  The award will be made based on ?Best Value? to the Government, in accordance with the evaluation factors set forth in the Request for Quotation package. The RFQ package will be available on or about July 16, 2002. Quotes will be due 30 days from the release date of the Request for Quotation. Potential offerors must request the Request for Quotation package in writing to: Gregory Blair, Contract Specialist, NETC Satellite Procurement Office, Building E, Room 114A, 16825 S. Seton Avenue, Emmitsburg, Maryland 21727 OR greg.blair@fema.gov.

The objective of this requirement is to provide the following tasks: Task I)  Design of plastic microfluidic systems with patterned polyelectrolyte coatings; design and build plastic microfluidic systems using imprinting and/or laser ablation methods.  Ten microfluidic devices will be constructed in several plastic materials including polycarbonate, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephlalate; and
deposit polyelectrolyte coatings in plastic microchannels using laminar flow patterning for initial designs. Task II) Evaluate laser ablation as a method to further pattern selectively polyelectrolyte multilayers in microchannels; determine if laser ablation process is effective at removal of polyelectrolyte multilayers; and vary several parameters including laser fluence and number of polyelectrolyte layers to determine effectiveness of patterning. Task III)  Test coated microchannels to determine effect on electroosmotic flow; test electroosmotic flow in plastic microchannels using caged fluorescent dye techniques; test effect of coatings on electroosmotic flow; and determine if patterned polyelectrolyte coatings are stable over time. Task IV)  Provide initial evaluation of effectiveness of polyelectrolyte multilayers for altering and manipulating microflow and 
provide data in a report on the study of electroosmotic flow in plastic microchannels with polyelectrolyte multilayers.   Mr. Howell is the only source for this service as he has extensive experience in the development of polyelectrolyte multilayer coatings in microchannel systems. his experience includes design, development, characterization, testing, and application of polyelectrolyte miltilayers for use in analytical separations. It is necessary to perform the work on the NIST premises since other work performed in the laboratory interacts with the development of the coatings described herein.

<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the Department of Commerce to acquire a Continuous Wave (CW) Titanium:  Sapphire Laser System from Coherent Laser Group, 5100 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, CA  95054.  Recently, a group of NIST scientists built the world's first (and, so far, only) optical clock.  This clock has demonstrated stability more than 50 times higher than the best primary standards in use today.  In order to evaluate the accuracy of the NIST optical time and frequency standard, NIST scientists are building a second optical clock whose performance must be comparable to the first optical clock.  Both optical timepieces are based on a narrow, ultraviolet transition in a single, ultra-cold 199Hg+ ion, which is confined in an electromagnetic trap and laser-cooled by narrow-band radiation at 194 nm.  The 194 nm radiation is generated by mixing laser light at 792 nm with laser light at 257 nm.  The laser radiation at 792 nm is to be generated by a CW Titanium:sapphire laser system which must satisfy the specifications detailed below.  Coherent Radiation, Inc.'s product uniquely satisfies the following specifications:  (a)  The Ti:sapphire laser must be single frequency and generate continuous wave, narrow band radiation with a linewidth " 100 kHz anywhere in its operating spectrum.  The power specifications at 792 nm must exceed 300 mW with 5 W of pump power at 532 nm.  (b) The tuning range of the Ti: sapphire laser must span 717 nm and 792 nm.  (c)  The Ti: sapphire laser must be upgradeable with a simple change of the optics to span from 700 nm - 990 nm.  (d)  It must be possible to scan the Ti:sapphire laser continuously over 3 GHz without mode hops.  (e)  It must be possible to actively lock the frequency of the Ti:sapphire laser to the half-power point of the natural linewidth of an atomic transition.   This acquisition is for a commercial item for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested concerns must submit a written qualification statement that clearly establishes the firm's capability to meet the above requirements.  This qualification statement shall be submitted to the individual and office cited above within 18 days from the date this synopsis is posted on the Internet.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the government will consider all proposals received within 18 days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Southern Plains Area for the Agricultural Research Service, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture intends to issue an award to Advanced Design & Machine, 7339 State Rd 28 East, Clarks Hill, IN 47930.  This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Instantaneous-Profile Laser Scanner was developed by the USDA, ARS and Advanced Design & Machine, Inc. through a Research Cooperative Agreement.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations (RFQ) for competition.  This is a simplified acquisition.  The Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit of the Cropping Systems Research Laboratory in Lubbock, Texas conducts applied and fundamental research on the causes and consequences of wind-induced soil erosion and the interactions of plants with the soil and atmosphere.  Detailed soil surface elevation measurements are required to develop digital elevation maps and other mathematical and statistical descriptions of the soil surface.  A device is needed that will perform in the field and laboratory.  The field environment will include surface elevation measurements over tilled, ridged fields.  The total near-surface relief may be up to 60 to 70cm in height.  The data should be collected over an area of not less than one-square meter in a very rapid and precise manner.  This laser scanner is able to measure instantaneously the elevations along a profile.  0A laser creates a 45 cm long bright line on the soil surface.  A digital CCD camera with a photodiode senses this line and takes a picture every 6.5 seconds.  The location of the laser on the 2D CCD array depends on the height of the surface along the laser line.  After calibration, the CCD coordinates (line, row) are Converted to X and Y values.  The ensemble camera-laser is attached on a carriage.  This carriage moves along a rail.  A field PC pilots the carriage movement and the picture acquisition.  Then the pictures are processed in real-time and stored and also viewed on the computer screen.  It takes only seconds to make a 4 m transect, 45 cm wide.  The vertical resolution is 0.5 mm.  The purpose of the device is to measure soil surface roughness along a 45 cm wide and 3 m long transect.  The roughness data must be digitized for further analyses.  The data acquisition system must be capable of the user selecting the X and Y coordinates sampled (i. e. separation distance between sample observations).  The system must be capable of measuring a range of roughness heights from a few millimeters up to about 70 cm.  The instrument must be rugged enough for field use as well as lab use.  Field use will include ambient temperatures ranging from 30 - 120 F.  Questions should be received within 14 calendar days of this published notification.   Questions may be directed to: Michael A. Douglas, Contracting Officer at (979) 260-9480 or Fax: (979) 260-9413.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541611   1This is a combined synopsis/request for quotes (RFQs) for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. RFQs are being  requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is PR-DC-02-02417 and is issued as a RFQ.  The RFQ document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-07. This is a small business set aside and the  associated NAICS code 541611 and a small business standard of $6 million.  The following contract line item numbers (CLINs) apply for this procurement:  CLIN No. 0001 - Develop a 16 hour training course which includes a Teacher's Guide, Student Training Workbook and a CD ROM of the developed  Teacher's Guide and Student Training Workbook.

Quantity is one  each per CLIN.  Background and description of requirement: In the absence of very substantial public contributions, the only way for private real estate development to occur is if there is a market for the product and if the capital employed in the development, operation, and maintenance of the  developed property will achieve a return on investment at levels dictated by the marketplace.  Similarly, private developers must appreciate that public officials and employees are engaged in activities mandated by law and supported by a broad base of the public that includes the real estate  community as well as the general citizenry.  CLIN 0001 is intended to familiarize government employees and officials, at the national, state, and local levels, whose decisions and work impact the real estate industry and real estate development, with the kinds of problems faced in the development  process and whether things that the government can do, can either encourage development that the government thinks is desirable or diminish the constraints and costs that government processes can place on the development of real estate.  The training course must address the interactions of the  following:  1) environmental regulations (e.g., Brownfields, RCRA, UST, EIS, wetlands, etc.); 2) land use regulation, in general (e.g., zoning, historical preservation); 3) general local requirements (e.g., building regulations, demolition permits, plan review and building permits, inspections,  traffic); 4) private finance; 6) public finance and expenditures; and, 7) taxes. CLIN 0001 must utilize lectures, case analyses and discussions.

The  Contractor shall incorporate EPA's review edits into the Teacher's Guide and Student Training Workbook.  The Contractor shall deliver a final copy of the Teacher's Guide and Student Training Workbook and a CD ROM containing the Teacher's Guide and Student Training Workbook.  Final CLIN 0001 shall  be delivered by September 25, 2002. FAR clause 52.227-17, Rights in Data Special Works is applicable to this contract.  The Government will make copies of the printed Teacher's Guide and Student Training Workbook and deliver to training attendees. The Contractor shall present each training session  over a 3-day period.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Services (NOS), Center for Coastal Environmental Health and Biomolecular Research, Charleston, South Carolina intends to issue a contract to the Medical University of South Carolina for technical/scientific research assistance.  The first requirement is for a senior-level scientist to assist in the scientific direction and technical oversight of multi-disciplinary research to determine environmental perturbations on marine mammal health and long-term viability of populations.  Research emphasis will investigate impacts of environmental stressors on bottlenose dolphin populations using an integrated approach with multiple measures of health.   Investigative approaches will include the development of diagnostic and biomedical assays and bioindicators to assess risk and develop epidemiological models.  The tasks involved will encompass the planning and implementation of research activities to determine health of marine mammals in the coastal environment and will produce scientific data, reports and manuscripts on integrated health measurements.  The second requirement is for technical and scientific assistance to help adapt biomedical theory and technologies to the development of diagnostic assays for health status of marine organisms, provide assistance in developing a research strategy to elucidate underlying mechanisms of organismal responses to environmental stressors at a cellular and biochemical level and provide training to CCEHBR staff in methodologies associated with the biochemistry of proteins and functional genomics.  These include but are not limited to bioinformatic data mining, protein expression and purification (i.e. recombinant gene expression), discovery and functional characterization of candidate bioindicators (i.e. proteomic analysis via 2D electrophoresis and mass-spectrometry analyses).  The tasks involved will produce scientific data, reports, peer-reviewed manuscripts and potential novel assays for use in assessing organismal condition.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division intends to award a sole source modification to Outstart, Inc., located at 89 South Street, 8th Floor Lincoln Plaza, Boston, MA 01760, to the existing NILARS commercial IQC N61339-02-D-0006.  The purpose of this modification is to provide for the possibility to order forty Evolution LCMS software stand alone client applications, its associated licenses, stand alone user training, the maintenance and support of those licenses as well as two hundred days of technical support services on the existing NILARS commercial IQC.  The stand-alone client application is an extension of Outstart's Evolution software and resides on a client computer.  It contains the authoring portion of the parent installation of Evolution software server application.  The stand-alone client application enables assembly of courses at a remote client location with periodic connection to a network (versus constant connection to a network) for the purpose of exchanging learning and media objects with the Evolution database, and/or posting of learning objects or courses for review.  Outstart Incorporated is the sole proprietary owner of the Evolution LCMS software and as such has produced and owns the programming code necessary for the two parts of the application to operate together as one system.  Outstart personnel are the only source which provide both the training and annual maintenance and support for the stand-alone client applications as well as the technical support services for the Evolution LCMS software.  This is not a request for quotation, nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  This contract modification will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  NAWCTSD intends to award a sole source contract modification fifteen (15) business days after publication of this notice.  Questions concerning this sole source modification may be directed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Kate Holcomb, e-mail address: holcombkl@navair.navy.mil or NAWCTSD, 12350 Research Parkway, Attn: Kate Holcomb Code 25333, Orlando, FL 32826.

<DESC>The following information has been added for further clarification of this need:

The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix.   The multi-genome custom GeneChip (registered trade mark) probe array will be housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. We will process the chips on Dr. Lempickie's Affymetrix system in Frederick, MD (NIAID) which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray (registered trade mark) Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix are compatible with the Affymetrix system in place at Dr Lempickies laboratory.  In addition, we have no photolithography-based chip processing system on site at RML. It is critical that we obtain the Affymetrix custom gene chip described above and process these chips on Dr. Lempickie's Affymetrix system.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance in the preparation and evaluation of tender documents for the procurement and installation of a Municipal Information Technology (IT) System.

The Municipality of Bucharest prepared a technical specification and Request for Proposals (RFP) for the procurement and installation of a Municipal IT System.  This opportunity was advertised in August 2001.  After a lengthy evaluation period, and multiple requests for clarification from the competitors, one respondent was selected and a contract written.  After multiple protests, an extended review period, and confirmation of the propriety of the bidding process, the contract was cancelled.

The Municipality has an urgent need for the IT system specified.  In order to move forward with this project, however, the Municipality needs an outside advisor to set the parameters of the project. 

This Technical Assistance is designed to assist the Municipality in managing the procurement process and aid in managing the implementation of the project itself.  The Terms of Reference (TOR) includes: 1) a revision of the specifications, 2) a restructuring of the RFP, 3) developing procurement and evaluation process, 4) assisting in contract award, and 5) preparing a final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $76,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed RFP, which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, July 24, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to determine potential sources capable of designing, developing, integrating, and testing a Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) subsystem for the Multi-Sensor Command and Control Aircraft (MC2A) weapon system. The MC2A is the key piece of the MC2 Constellation that will extend the commander's eyes and ears while serving as the primary element of the C2 architecture.  The first increment of MC2A will utilize an MP-RTIP radar on a 767-400ER with a BMC4I suite that provides initial battle management capability to include ground moving target indicator missions, Cruise Missile Defense, UAV control, and time critical targeting in support of the Air Operations Center.  The second increment is planned to add Airborne Early Warning and Control capabilities.  The MC2A will be fully integrated within the architecture of joint combat and ISR systems, space-based systems, and all-source intelligence exploitation systems to achieve the highest predictive battlespace awareness. The BMC4I subsystem consists of all of the non-radar and non-aircraft subsystems including the central computing architecture, networks, data storage, data manipulation, data fusion, data exploitation, communications and data link capability.  An Acquisition Ombudsman, Colonel Joseph P. Maryeski, Director, Commander's Staff, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development. You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer.  The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired. The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection. You can contact the Ombudsman at (781) 377-5106. See Note 26.

<SUBJECT>65 -- NBC Shelter Airlock
<SOLNBR>F41624-02-YA-RFI
<RESPDATE>080902
<ARCHDATE>08242002
<CONTACT>Benjamin Sherrill, Contracts Manager, Phone 210-536-5774, Fax 210-536-2097, Email benjamin.sherrill@brooks.af.mil
<DESC>Task: Entry/Exit Airlock for NBC Transportable Protective Shelters

Objective:
The 311 HSW, Human Systems Program Office is seeking information on the commercial capabilities and costs of developing an airlock to be used with Collective Protection (CP) shelters currently in inventory.  There is a possibility of limited procurement of production units in FY04.

Background:
The Joint Services currently use four airlocks for CP shelters: the Protective Entrance (PE), the Tunnel Airlock for Litter Patients (TALP), the Supply Airlock (SA), and the Bump-Through Door (BTD) Airlock.  If personnel are contaminated with CB agents, they must be processed through a decontamination station prior to entering through airlocks.  Once inside the airlock, filtered air is used to remove any remaining airborne contaminants before gaining access into the CP shelter.  All of these airlock systems have their limitations, more specifically, the number of persons that can be accommodated, purge time needed to clear airlock from any contaminants, and durability.  The PE holds one ambulatory person and has a purge time of three minutes; the TALP holds a patient on a litter and has a purge time of one minute. The major limitation is that these two systems can only accommodate one person, and the TALP does not allow the patient to be administered medical assistance.  The SA was developed for the Tent Extendable Modular Personnel (TEMPER) system to bring in medical supplies on an aircraft pallet.  It has a purge time of 55 to 90 minutes, if the recirculation filter is used the minimum the purge time is 55 minutes.  The PE, TALP and SA are modular components of the M28 Collective Protection Equipment (CPE).  The BTD Airlock is a multipurpose continuously purged airlock that allows the entry and exit of personnel and supplies.  It was the result of an effort to develop an airlock system that would expeditiously meet the Air Fore medical community requirements.  It uses two sets of modified hard bump-through-doors already in inventory, an extended vestibule CP liner modified to accommodate the hard doors.  Also, a modified FFA 580 blower/filter unit is used to decrease the purge time of the larger airlock to three minutes by providing a high flow rate of clean air through the airlock.  The current BTD Airlock is a component of the Collectively Protected Expeditionary Medical Support (CP EMEDS) and the AF Transportable Collective Protection System (AF TCPS); it allows the user to bring in two patients on standard NATO litters with litter bearers and attendants or 12 ambulatory personnel.  Dimensions of the standard NATO collapsible litters are as follows:

Overall length is 90 inches
Overall width is 22 7/8 inches
Bed length is 72 inches
Bed width is 22 7/8 inches

Limitations of the BTD Airlock include its weight (950 lbs), packing volume, lack of durability, and set-up complexity (includes blower, filters, ducting, etc).



Requirement:
The intent of this RFI is to collect information on technology that could meet the needs of the Joint Services (limited development may be possible) for a state-of-the-art, lightweight, durable, thermal efficient, and low purge time airlock?s that can accommodate a multiple number of personnel and/or litter patients with litter bearers and medical attendants and to subsequently procure airlocks for Joint Service applications.  The government is interested in capabilities, technologies, reliability, maintainability and technical data for development of a multi-purpose airlock that can operate in an active Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment and must be capable of interfacing with current transportable CP liners and shelters used by the Joint Services.  Currently, a Chemical and Biological (CB) liner made from a 5-layer Saranex laminate is being used in shelters and airlocks to provide CB protection.  Information on new material for the development of a new Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) resistant and thermal efficient liner is also sought.  In addition, information on new technologies for blowers and filtration that are applicable to airlocks is also sought.  Airlock should be rugged with a rigid frame and be easily and rapidly erected without creating a safety hazard.  It must be an improvement over current airlocks in the areas of weight, packing value, and cost.  The airlock will interface with the standard M28 CPE vestibule membrane opening and be compatible with existing CP liner closures adopted in the TEMPER and Air Force Medical Shelter System (AF Small Shelter) shelters.  
 
NOTE:  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS OR ARE GUARENTEED TO BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS RFI.
  
The government will retain comments and information received in response to this RFI.  Proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary.  Do not use Government security classification markings.  Sources submitting a response and interested also in making a technical presentation may arrange to do so by contacting              
Mr. Michael Forbis, Contracting Officer, at 210-536-6390 or through e-mail at Michael.Forbis@brooks.af.mil.  All written responses/comments must be received	 by	 4 p.m. CDT, 09 Aug 02.

<CONTACT>Cynthia Sanders, 703-325-9210
<DESC>NA The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to establish long-term strategic partnerships with several colleges and universities.  The purpose of these partnerships will be to provide DTRA additional research and development capabilities, and to mai ntain critical skills needed by the Department of Defense in the science and engineering communities.  DTRA intends to award multiple year contracts to selected colleges and universities based on responses to a forthcoming Broad Area Announcement (BAA).   DTRAs strategic partnership objectives are to obtain new ideas, perspectives, and independent views related to the DTRA mission essential functions that are unencumbered by how we have done things in the past.  Such independent and new perspectives could address technology, policy, strategy, or related infrastructure considerations.  In addition, we recognize that independent organizations may well already possess unique facilities/capabilities that could be effectively put to use on issues of concern for DTRA.   DTRA intends to solicit university assistance in any or all of its four mission essential function areas; Combat Support, Technology Development, Threat Control, and Threat Reduction.  Selected colleges and universities may be awarded contracts to:    Assist the Agency in its Combat Support role to the Department of Defense to deter, engage and assess the WMD threat and challenges posed to the US and its allies.  Specifically, provide the intellectual framework to develop - Improved WMD response capabilities - Enhanced capabilities for forces operating in WMD environments - Assessments regarding the threat from improvised nuclear devices and radiation dispersal devices, and the potential to deter such threats - Assessments of the political ramifications of nuclear release in an allied or friendly country - Understanding of the future value of deterrence and its characteristics - WMD forensics capabilities   Conduct Technology Development research and development activities in coordination with the Agency.  Specifically, - Assess the relative weight to be placed on simulations versus simulators.  What are the practical and theoretical limits of each? - Understand the theoretical limits to conventional attack of deep and buried targets.   - Develop microscale weather modeling for use in collateral effects calculations and consequence management - Propose innovative energy production, distribution and storage mechanisms for various applications  - Develop electromagnetic threat protection and applications - Improve detection and characterization of biological and chemical threats - Develop innovative means to defeat/neutralize WMD agents - Analyze weapon system performance - Develop unconventional and conventional means to functionally defeat WMD facilities and delivery systems   Support Agency Threat Control efforts to shape and manage technology security by, - Developing non-intrusive detection mechanisms for WMD - Integrating surveillance, detection, and characterization of threats linked to pretested menus of responses - Developing super networks which can interconnect multiple databases and perform detailed analysis of large masses of data-including artificial intelligence - Assessing the impact of future arms control treaty policy and implementation  - Innovating advanced technologies for verification and compliance monitoring   Support Agency Threat Reduction efforts to assist eligible states of the former Soviet Union to reduce the threat of WMD devices and proliferation. Specifically, - Improve management systems for enhanced monitoring and accountability of high value items - Develop enhanced security systems for positive control of weapons and weapons by-products - Assess policies and strategies for expanding current agreements to include the full range of WMD - Develop structural protection, response, and repair tools The purpose of this synopsis is to solicit feedback, to be used by DTRA to properly scope the BAA, from potentially interested colleges and universities.  Specifically, DTRA requests potentially interested academic institutions to respond to any or all of the following questions: 1)  What part(s) of the above DTRA mission essential functions would your institution be interested in responding to? 2)  What duration contract and dollar value would be enough to provide a viable contract for a long-term partnership? 3)  How should we optimally structure the resulting contract to get the best results and give you the optimum flexibility?  Are there ways, other than a Broad Area Announcement, to establish a Strategic Partnership, which would lead to a contract that you suggest we consider? 4)  Does your university fall within the category of 'Historically Black College or University'? 5)  Does your university have partnerships with any other government organizations, such as the Department of Energy or other parts of the Department of Defense?  Do these partnerships utilize similar kinds of skills? 6)  What selection criteria would you suggest be used to select a small set of academic institutions for long-term partnerships? Please send responses to any or all of these questions, and any other feedback, to Cynthia Sanders, Contract Specialist, via facsimile at (703) 325-9294 or e-mail (cynthia.sanders@dtra.mil) or mail to (DTRA/ALT, 6801 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22310-33 98) by close of business on 23 July.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES FOR AIRBORNE RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE FOR DETECTION, LOCALIZATION, AND CLASSIFICATION  OF BURIED MINES IN AMPHIBIOUS LANDING BEACHES The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida, is seeking sources to conduct research and development to solve the problem of detecting, localizing, and classifying, from an airborne platform, buried anti-personnel and anti-vehicular mines and minefields deployed in the littoral battlespace, specifically from the surf zone through the beach exit zone.  If an amphibious force can conduct unmanned aerial standoff threat detection and collection of imagery, data, or other information on buried mines, it will possess a capability that does not exist in the current MCM inventory.  This capability will be of critical imp ortance for traversing a defended amphibious landing zone.  The technology would lend itself to the automatic detection of minefields.  This effort will encompass the conduct of all analysis, modeling, algorithm investigations, research, design, fabrication, testing, development, environmental assessment, phenomenology investigations, reporting and documentation required to bring to fruition and/or reduce to engineering practice technologies permitting enhanced detection, localization, and classification of buried mines and/or minefields. The goals of the research effort are to demonstrate:  Technology for sensors, sensor systems, or sensor packages which, when mounted in a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) will remotely detect in some way the presence of mines buried in the surf zone, the beach zone, or the inland environment,  Technology for image and/or othe r data processing which will act upon the raw data, however obtained, in such a manner as to display the presence of buried mines and/or minefields,  Technology for packaging sensors and processing in a lightweight UAV,  Supporting activity in modeling, environmental assessment, phenomenology, and database formation,  Advanced algorithm developments to facilitate buried mine detection, and  Sensor fusion technologies to facilitate buried mine detection. Successful technology developments may be investigated for future transitions as P3I to existing systems or separate transitions to engineering development as appropriate. Interested sources on this program will be required to demonstrate:   Recent and relevant experience in development of sensor technologies relatable to buried mine/minefield detection, or data and/or image processing technologies relatable to  buried mine detection, or techniques, algorithms and procedures for automatic detection of buried mines/minefields. Interested firms shall respond within 30 days of this Sources Sought Announcement with complete and detailed documentation showing the company's product and capability as detailed above. Only potential prime contractors should respond. A list of responding potential prime contractors will be furnished to potential subcontractors upon request.  Direct expression of interest in participating in this program and supporting documentation should be addressed in writing to Mr. Mark P. Ross, Code XPS1, NAVSEA Coastal Systems Station, 6703 West Highway 98, Panama City, FL 32407-7001, PH (850) 235-5624, FAX (850) 234-4251, E-mail RossMP@ncsc.navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Follow-on to Set Up Focus Group Discussions
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to award on a sole source basis under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with KPMG Consulting, 1676 International Drive, McLean, VA 22101 a logical follow-on to a current GSA contract to set up a series of focus group discussions across the country that build upon the current Health Improvement Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) initiative.  KPMG has developed and administered the first set of HIPAA focus groups from which results have been of very high quality.  KPMG therefore has the necessary organizational and project experience already in place to efficiently continue the operation of the HIPAA focus groups.  Any other contractor would have to begin from a zero-based framework which would be a drawback given the time constraints involved.  If there are no affirmative written responses received within (45) calendar days from the published date of this notice, a purchase order shall be awarded.
