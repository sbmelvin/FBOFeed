<DESC>NASA intends to extend Contract NNA04CA76C with Planners Collaborative, Inc. on asole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Theobjective is to extend the performance period for three and a half additional months.The current Contractor provides support for users and occupants of Ames Research Centerunder Business Operations and Technical Services (BOATS). The principal purpose of thiscontract is to provide a variety of professional and para-professional functions tovarious divisions at NASA-ARC. The Contractor provides support for scientific andtechnical information, including video, photo, publications, printing and libraryservices; human resource management and training; acquisitions; equal opportunity andaffirmative action; commercial technology; public affairs and education outreach; legaloffice; and related administrative programs. This extension will allow for a continuationof services to ensure program continuity and critical mission support and avoidsignificant technical impacts while a competitive follow-on acquisition is completed. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA04CA76C,for a period of three and a half months, from December 31, 2009 through April 15, 2010,and increase the contract value accordingly.  The current contractor, PlannersCollaborative, Inc. is considered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given theshort period of performance for the extension.	Awarding a three and a half monthcontract to another source, at the same time as the recompetition of the follow-on is inprocess, would result in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays infulfilling the Governments requirements and not allow for a sufficient phase-in period,thereby affecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays infulfilling ARCs requirements.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact no later than 4:00 PM. PST on November 30, 2009.  A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed effort, based upon responses to this notice, issolely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Questions regardingthe extension can be sent via email to Starr L. Strong at Starr.L.Strong@nasa.gov. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Specifically, the Government is contemplating the use of either a single- or multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for the requirement described below;  (2) the level of socio-economic participation contemplated based on the goals identified in the attachment regarding whether the level contemplated may or may not be attainable or exceeded; and (3) whether as a result of your review you have identified any possible ambiguities, inconsistencies, or unduly requirements in the attached Statement of Objectives (SOO) or the any of the Statements of Work (SOW) for the six sample task orders.    Interested contractors may submit a separate white paper  providing comments back on each of the 3 areas identified above. Additionally, each white paper should specifically address the pros and cons associated with managing each contract vehicle and the contemplated level of socio-economic targeted for the NDWSP Program.

Organizations that will participate in this conference are requested to email the names of participants and number of lines they will be needing for the dial-in to jlewis@mail.nih.gov. The dial-in number is 1.800.366.7242, passcode is 84007.
<p>Cancer research has benefited during the last decade from the development of novel genomic analyses technologies. Knowledge of the human transcriptome has resulted in tools that allow for the interrogation of most of transcribed sequenced (protein or non-protein coding). The availability of the reference human genome resulted in technology that identified many of the genomic changes at the chromosomal region/region copy number level as well as the ability to determine loss of heterozygosity. Finally, the recent development of sequencing by synthesis or ligation methods and the instrumentation to support them is providing powerful and more precise approaches to characterize the transcriptome (gene expression changes, chimeric transcripts etc.), genome (deletions, amplifications, translocations) and epigenome (changes of methylation profiles) of tumors and at the same time as identifying the changes at the single nucleotide level, including base mutations, small deletions, insertions (in/dels), etc. The 2nd generation sequencing technologies are still improving and there is an expectation that the successful Contractors will implement them once they are validated in a pipeline environment.</p>
<p>There has been some success in transforming discoveries of somatic aberrations, especially mutations, into clinical utility. The advances in characterization and sequencing using the new technologies allows a more rapid progress for these discoveries, therefore, NCI plans to bring the 2nd generation ("nextgen") sequencing technologies to bear on the TARGET Initiative.</p>
<p>With this procurement we seek to obtain that 2nd generation sequencing capacity to sequence between 94-188 pediatric cancer cases each for 2-5 different cancer types to identify DNA mutations (such point mutation, deletions, insertions, etc.). Cancer Cases will be provided by through the TARGET pipeline. 2nd generation sequencing is defined as sequencing by synthesis or ligation with massively parallel throughput (examples can be found in Mardis, ER Trends in Gen 24:133, 2008). The scope of sequencing is either the exome (the minimum is either ~6,000 genes as defined and specified below or the complete exome), the complete transcriptome or whole genome for the same number cases. The aim is to utilize the new sequencing technologies in a highly cost-effective, high-throughput and efficient manner (i.e. Sanger sequencing does not meet this programs goals).</p>
<p>The contractor is to provide their most current technology for the sequencing under the program. Therefore contractors may elect to sequence one of the below depending on what is required by their technology. The contract will be modified to reflect that technology and deliverables. The Contractor shall specify which technology is being proposed and what sequencing will be performed.</p>

<CONTACT>William T. Schaeffer, Contract Specialist, Phone 5712269619, Email schaefferwt@state.gov
<DESC>Synopsis:
The Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, is looking for sources to provide training facilities and qualified instructor personnel in support of the Office of Anti Terrorism Assistance.
The US Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Training Directorate, Office of Antiterrorism Assistance (DS/T/ATA) manages the antiterrorism assistance program.  ATA assists foreign partners to develop the capability for antiterrorism planning and coordination and commitment to support US counterterrorism objectives.  This includes coordinating, synchronizing, implementing and expanding training and technical assistance programs; sharing technology with foreign partners; establishing or strengthening alliances and/or agreements, regional partnerships, and security assistance programs; promoting interagency cooperation among foreign government security and law enforcement forces; and supporting exchange programs.
The programs geographic reach is extensive, having trained over 61,000 foreign police and civilian security officials in over 152 countries since inception in 1983.  Country assistance plans are implemented through advanced training, technical assistance, and equipment grants including computers and software.  Capacity building projects are tailored to the needs of each Partner Nation.
DS/T/ATA requires contractor support for ATAs specialized foreign assistance mission.  This contract will support the ATA office in conducting foreign law enforcement training and related activities, both domestic and overseas. 
A solicitation will be issued to select multiple ( two) prime contractors. Contractors must be US companies based in the United States.  Contractor will provide overseas and domestic instructor-led training; specialized and advanced technical assistance; domestic training facilities; and training-related support services.  This contract is unclassified.  No facilities security clearances or personal security clearances are required.  While no personal security clearances are required, instructor personnel will require some type of vetting which we expect will be short of what is required for a moderate risk, public trust determination.
ATA has a course portfolio of approximately 50 courses with 325 scheduled events each year.    During any given week, ATA can be conducting 10-20 courses worldwide.  Approximately 85 percent of the courses are taught overseas.  The remaining courses are taught domestically and will required training and support facilities within the 48 contiguous States.
DS anticipates release of a finalized RFP in December 2009 and contract award by the end of March 2010.

DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W912DY09R0023.<br><br>This synopsis publicizes contract actions proposed to support the US Army Engineering and Support Centers Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) Program. The purpose of the DESC program is to support federally funded petroleum facilities and military installations under the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), DESC, other Department of Defense (DOD) Activities, and other Federal Activities throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions (CONUS and OCONUS)with compliance programs for tanks, piping, separators, dispensing units, and support facilities procurement/installation, and maintenance requirements. These services will consist of those actions required to preserve and maintain Government petroleum real property facilities in such a condition that they may be effectively used for their designated functional purpose. In order to accomplish this objective, the DESC program proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts (MATOC), under which firm-fixed price (FFP), or time and materials (T&M) task orders may be issued. <BR><BR>Work will be accomplished through performance based work statements stating the measurable performance standards, and performance incentives where appropriate. Preventive maintenance tasks will be defined as re-current, periodic or scheduled work to preserve a facility by preventing its deterioration.  Other maintenance may be ordered for non-petroleum systems such as for separators, piping, tanks, sewers, storm drains, etc.  Minor Repair will be defined as the restoration of a real property to such a condition that it may effectively be utilized for its designated purpose by overhaul, reprocessing or replacement of constituent parts or materials that have deteriorated by action or elements or usage and that have not been corrected through maintenance.  Periodic testing of systems/components, generally on a quarterly basis, is included within the DESC definitions of maintenance and repair. Other repair may be ordered for non-petroleum systems such as for separators, piping, tanks, sewers, storm drains, or requirements to meet compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Some maintenance funded construction services will be required to support the continual operation, maintenance and use of these facilities, systems, and equipment. These construction services may involve the alteration, conversion, and/or reconfiguration of petroleum facilities, systems, and equipment. Specific work requirements to be performed include:  maintenance and repair of exposed piping, system components, pumps, valves, electrical and static grounding, aboveground storage tanks, belowground storage tanks, swivels and swing joints, ground cables, disconnect switches, surge arrestors, class III systems, gaskets, filter separators, water drains, micronic filters, cathodic protection, dikes, AFSS, ATG, and system control panels, vacuum and pressure vents, liquid level gauges and low-level controls, high-level control valves and alarms, dispensers, and tank gauges, starters and contactors, wiring and fuse boxes, grounding conductors, flow meters, dispenser calibration, vapor recovery system, pressure gages, pressure relief valves and shear valves, static ground rods, and hoses.  In addition, pressure tests of piping at class III facilities, pressure tests of piping at non-class III facilities, tank tightness testing, and development of operation and maintenance manuals will also be performed.<BR><BR>The proposed ordering period is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods.  The total programmatic DESC requirements expected to be awarded under the contracts are anticipated to equal approximately $35,000,000 (if the options are exercised). This synopsis publicizes a proposed solicitation (request for proposal) for a small business set-aside competition.  Any contract(s) resulting from the proposed solicitation is set-aside for small business concerns. Offers from other than small business concerns will not be considered.  The total capacity will be shared amongst all awardees in the MATOC pool.  It is anticipated that approximately 33 task orders will be awarded during the base year.  <BR><BR>This acquisition may require the handling and generation of classified information.  This support may call for extensive domestic and international travel.  Personnel shall be able to obtain necessary security clearances.    <BR><BR>The solicitation will be made available to interested parties through the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov, after the closing date of this synopsis.  All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency in accordance with the solicitation requirements.

<DESC>SynopsisThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), Eatontown, NJ 07724, intends to procure software development services under full and open competition (no set-aside used) to extend two pre-existing software applications known as "StandingSentry" and "AutoOrder" through collaborative agile development.  StandingSentry is intended to provide an interface to capture lab results suspicious for malignancy that need the special attention of the provider(s).  StandingSentry shall access radiological and lab test reports, consult and other clinic notes; it shall detect patients with radiological exams and studies, specialty consults or lab results suspicious for malignancy by retrieving test results appropriately flagged in laboratory and radiological databases periodically on a fairly frequent basis (referred to as "index study" in this document); it  shall enable automatic ordering of lab tests, radiological studies and consults; it shall interface with appointment schedules to activate and resolve clinical reminders; and it shall maintain a VistA FileMan database of patient demographics and the critical path taken for orders evaluated.  The purpose of StandingSentry is to enable oversight and redundancy making the evaluation of the index study failsafe.  It shall also enable evaluation of the cycle time from definitive diagnosis to treatment and process improvement efforts aimed at reducing failures and cycle times thus ensuring timely and appropriate treatment.AutoOrder is intended for health maintenance built upon the existing reminder system and used to automatically order lab tests and inform the patient that these orders need to be done by the patient.   AutoOrder relies on the reminder system patient reports which are generally run once every week.  AutoOrder shall perform the following: enable access to and evaluation of radiology and lab reports, orders, and future and past appointments anywhere in VANCHCS with any service; identify those patients who need clinical reminders, or are past due for routine interventions to manage their chronic conditions; activate clinical reminder reports through VistA; enable patient contact through automatic telephone calls in their physician or provider's own voice, and allow for Secure Messaging and the Postcard system; maintain a list of those patients using co managed care orders; enable contact with those patients' outside physician or provider's office; and ensure coordinated medical care.The solicitation will be issued as a request for quote (RFQ) from the VA TAC, and the number assigned to it will be VA118-10-RQ-0030. The associated NAICS code for this effort is 541511.  The proposed action is for a six month, Firm-Fixed Price type contract.  The place of performance shall be at the contractor's facility.  All proposal documents and communications shall be made available through the Contract Specialist, Mark Junda, via email at mark.junda@va.gov, or via telephone at 732.578.5428.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION651 Aeronautical Systems Squadron (AESS) (B-52)Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB), Ohio
1.0	Description
1.1 Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) in support of the 651 AESS is seeking information on the interest and capability of prime integrating contractors for a new/replacement radar system for the current B-52H AN/APQ-166 strategic radar.

1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertainin! g to this requirement.
2.0	Background
The Government is investigating the possibility of initiating a B-52H strategic radar replacement program.  The objective would be to identify, integrate, test, produce, and field a replacement radar system to address supportability issues beginning in 2016.
The AN/APQ-166 Mechanically Scanned Array (MSA) radar system currently installed on the B-52H fleet was originally fielded in the 1950s, last upgraded to its present configuration in the early 1980s, and is approaching the end of its useful life.  The antenna assembly has corrosion issues and several components of the radar system are experiencing diminishing manufacturing source/materiel shortage (DMS/MS) situations.  Forecasts indicate that the B-52H radar system will become unsupportable beginning in the 2016 timeframe. 2.1 Planned Production:  A total of 76 aircraft would require retrofit with the new radar system, along with spares and trainers
2.2 Delivery Period:  Initial production kit deliveries in FY 16
2.3 Limitations:  Maximum number of aircraft that may be retrofit in any given year is between 17 and 24
2.4 Security Requirements:  In accordance with established B-52H Weapon System Master Security Classification Guide, 2 September 2008

3.0	Requested Information
Responders shall identify their capability to integrate a complete replacement radar system onto the B-52H aircraft assuming either a Government-furnished (i.e., GFE), Government-specified (i.e., directed Sub-contractor) or a Contractor-furnished (i.e., CFE) radar.    Although the Government prefers an "off-the-shelf" (OTS), or modified OTS radar solution, new system design shall not be precluded.  Potential sources must possess and demonstrate in their Response the following capabilities at a minimum:
.	Aeronautical Systems Engineering.	Technical analyses and Trade Studies.	Engineering drawing and technical data development.	Hardware and Software design and development.

Complex Military aircraft avionics / subsystems integration.	Electromagnetic Interference/Electromagnetic Compatibility engineering and test.	Nuclear hardening engineering.	Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL)
The Boeing Company presently owns a substantial portion of the B-52H technical data. The prospective Prime Integrating contractor for this effort shall be responsible for providing or obtaining access to all necessary B-52H data to meet program requirements through direct negotiation with The Boeing Company.  The Government will not provide any B-52H data to support this effort.  Responders shall provide specific details on how required technical data, expertise, facilities, tools, equipment, and personnel will be obtained to meet the requirements of this program.
The following assumptions are given:
.	The radar shall be nuclear hardened and support B-52H nuclear surety requirements.	System hardware must be available in sufficient quantities to support aircraft modifications beginning in 2016, with a minimum lifecycle through the 2040 timeframe.	The radar system shall employ a 2-level maintenance concept

<DESC>(a)	The Forest Service contemplates conducting a two-phase design-build acquisition using the procedures of FAR Subpart 36.3 for the Forest Highway 20 Reconstruction project from Coffman Cove junction to the Naukati junction on Prince of Wales Island.  This project is intended to provide for a fully designed, permitted, and constructed two-lane road for 8.2 miles of the North Prince of Wales highway.  Included in the design will be an option item for asphalt concrete surfacing.   The estimated magnitude of the project is between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000.
 
(b)	The Forest Service has completed some preliminary work, and anticipates being able to make information from the Civil Alignment Study Report available to potential offerors; we are hopeful of conducting the two phases of the acquisition with a contract award to a single firm by the September 2010.  The Civil Alignment Study Report, 2004, includes: 
	Design criteria standards
	Hydrological discharge graphs, flow master and FishXing reports
	Reconnaissance data forms for fish passage design structures
	Fish passage photographs
	Waste disposal sites investigation report and waste area review forms
	Construction cost estimate and alternatives cost estimate
	Fish passage construction cost estimate
	Civil alignment study drawings and cross sections

Also available is the Decision Notice and the Final Geotechnical Report from 2003.

(c) The Forest Service desires that firms interested in this project as a prime contractor identify themselves by the submission of a brief white paper.  We ask for this paper to be submitted as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) attachment in an e-mail to Martha DeFreest (mdefreest@fs.fed.us) with a cc to Kim Toland (kimtoland@fs.fed.us) by close of business on Wednesday, December 9, 2009.  The white paper and any accompanying cover letter should be brief (no more than seven (7) pages), should not exceed 1MB in size, and should be written with the intent of helping the Forest Service craft its acquisition approach so we can enhance our ability to obtain the design and construction services at reasonable prices and with efficiency in contractor proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.  The white paper should address the following topics:
     (1) The firm's name, address, DUNS number, and point of contact information;
     (2) The firm's size status, such as small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or 8(a) contractor;
     (3) The firm's experience as a prime contractor in design-build acquisitions and as a prime contractor for work similar to this project;
     (4) Advice on whether the Forest Service should issue one solicitation covering both phases, or two solicitations in sequence;
     (5) Advice on the timetable that the acquisition should follow in order to provide for a contract award at the end of phase two by September 2010;
     (6) Advice on the phase one evaluation factors, including the level of design work the Forest Service should seek from competing contractors as part of the phase one effort;
     (7) Advice on the phase two evaluation factors;
     (8) Comments on the suitability of this project for use of the two-phase selection process; and
     (9) Other advice, recommendations, or cautions for the Forest Service as we consider a two-phase design-build acquisition approach for this project.
 
(d) The Forest Service is not scheduling a pre-solicitation conference at this time.  We hope all interested parties will share helpful information with us through the white papers requested above.  The Forest Service has not yet made a definitive decision to issue a solicitation, and it has not made any definitive decisions regarding work scope, acquisition strategy, extent of competition, NAICS code, and so forth.  The information we learn from the white papers will help us as we make these decisions.  Other exchanges with industry may occur in the near future; this may include a pre-solicitation conference or one-on-one meetings with some or all white paper submitters.  Your participation and assistance through the submission of a white paper is appreciated.

<DESC>1. Background:  Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack.

2. Description:

A. Request for Information (RFI).  This is a Request for Information (RFI) on platform and/or sensor options for developing an Airborne Infrared (ABIR) capability for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA).   The MDA is investigating the potential of ABIR for meeting ballistic missile defense (BMD) needs.  The BMD need of current interest is fire control quality tracking at or near threat burnout to support early intercept. The purpose of this announcement is to obtain insight into existing platforms and sensors that could be modified and/or integrated to field ABIR systems to support missile defense in less than five years.  In an effort to conduct current market research in this area, MDA requests Commercial Industry, the National Laboratories and others describe their capabilities to support the ABIR mission.  

B.  MDA is requesting contractors interested in this acquisition submit a capability statement that demonstrates core capabilities and expertise.   MDA requests answers to the questions listed below.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. FURTHER, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />This is a Sources Sought notice with the intent to award a sole source contract to Carl Zeiss SMT, Inc. (Zeiss) under the authority of FAR 6.302 because Zeiss supplied the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) with the current LEO 1455 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) system described in this notice and is uniquely qualified to provide the upgrades to the existing Zeiss SEM system as described below. Notice is provided as information to the marketplace, market research, and is an invitation for any other qualified companies to express their interest in and demonstrate their capability to perform the required upgrade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span><br />The predecessor to Zeiss supplied the NTSB with its current LEO 1455 SEM system. The requirement is for an updated computer, SEM operating software and other necessary additional hardware and software, including installation, needed to allow updating the system's operating system to Windows XP as needed for NTSB network security requirements. The present system is a proprietary system of Zeiss and requires the appropriate Zeiss software and hardware for operation. Zeiss is unique in that it is the only known company that supplies compatible hardware, software, operating systems, and installation required for the upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />SEM examinations are a vital function of the NTSB Materials Laboratory for performing failure analysis, and are typically performed for the majority of investigations. In many instances, the SEM is pivotal in determining the root cause of a component failure. The present SEM computer is about 7 years old and at the end of its service life. To ensure continued service and to meet NTSB network security requirements, the SEM computer must be replaced. This also requires replacing and installing other components of the system including hardware and software to ensure compatibility. This new order will increase network safety, reduce maintenance and increase reliability of the SEM by replacing outdated hardware and software. The system will also improve functionality by incorporating new software technology that is faster and more efficient than the existing system. The present system is a proprietary system of Zeiss and requires the appropriate Zeiss software and hardware for operation. Zeiss is unique in that it is the only known company that supplies the compatible hardware, software, operating systems, and installation required for the upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Required Capabilities</span><br />The system's basic requirements are to acquire and display high magnification electron images and to control and operate the functions of a LEO (Zeiss) 1455 low pressure scanning electron microscope specimens as necessary for documentation of accident investigations. Acquisition and storage of digital images from the accident specimens is also required. Data resides locally but must be accessible from user workstations throughout the NTSB. The latest version of software must comply with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements. The NTSB also requires installation of the upgrades to the hardware and software of the system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements are invited to submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information, which must be prepared specifically in response to this notice should, must include: (1) identification of company or organization; (2) an assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements; (3) business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact; (4) notification of business size and /or special status; and (5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited. These expressions of interest shall adhere to a five (5)-page submission limit plus web links and any specialized product descriptions. The statement of qualifications should include only information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise, and experience to perform the requirements described in this notice. General marketing material should not be included. The NTSB prefers that companies do not submit proprietary material. However, the Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by NTSB. Parties must submit information within five (5) days of publication of this notice. NTSB will not return capability statements and the supporting documentation submitted in response to this notice. Telephone responses and inquiries will not be accepted. You may email questions regarding this notice to the issuing office to Bryan Moy via email at: bryan.moy@ntsb.gov.</p>

The U.S.Government will not pay for anyinformation or administrative costincurred in response to this RFI.  Allcosts associated with responding to thisRFI will be solely at the interestedpartys expense.  Not responding tothis RFI will not preclude participationin any future RFP if issued.2.0   BACKGROUNDThe Department of Defenseestablished the JTRS program toprovide a family of softwareprogrammable radios designed arounda Software CommunicationsArchitecture (SCA).  As such, the JTRSwill provide reliable multi-channelvoice, data, imagery, and videocommunications and eliminatecommunications problems causedby "stovepipe" legacy systems.  TheJTRS will achieve these objectivesthrough the procurement and fieldingof a digital, programmable, modularcommunication system based onsoftware-defined radio technology.The JTRS program consists of a seriesof joint acquisition activities, managedby JPEO JTRS.  The objective of JTRS isto develop, produce, integrate, andfield a family of interoperable, digital,modular, software defined radios thatoperate as nodes in a network toensure wireless communications andnetworking for mobile and fixedforces.  Specifically, JTRS will have theability to receive, transmit, and relayvoice, data, and video.  JTRS is beingdeveloped in a Joint environment, thusallowing maximum hardware andsoftware commonality and reducedporting efforts across Serviceplatforms.  Through implementation ofcommon waveforms, radios, software,and select ancillary component andnetwork management equipment, JTRSwill enable enhanced interoperability,reusability, supportability, and softwareportability, and will result in improvedspeed to capability, and more effectiveimplementation of incrementalcapability improvements.As part of this initiative, the JTRS NEDprogram is evaluating the means bywhich they can establish and provideSoftware In-Service Support for theJTRS Link 16 software within this familyof communications products.3.0   REQUESTED INFORMATIONInterested firms are invited to respondto this sources sought by providing awhite paper that summarizes theirrelevant experience, knowledge, andcapabilities regarding JTRS Link 16Software In-Service Support asidentified below.3.1 Describe process to investigate andvalidate problem reports with JTRS Link16 software.3.2 Experiences and/or capabilities withdevelopment, enhancement andmaintenance of JTRS and Link 16waveform software.3.3 Experiences and/or capabilities inporting and porting support of JTRSand Link 16 waveform software.3.4 Experiences in conduct of FormalQualification Testing (FQT) of JTRS andLink 16 waveform software includingJTEL testing for SCA and ApplicationProgramming Interface (API) standardscompliance.3.5 Experiences in support of NSAInformation Assurance (IA)assessment of JTRS and Link 16waveform software including UnifiedINFOSEC Criteria (UIC) allocation andWaveform Software Security Report(WSSR) development.3.6 Capabilities to identify, provide andmaintain a suitable waveformdevelopment and test environment.Identify test tools or lab equipmentthat is required as GFE/GFP and theestimated need date (e.g. 60 daysafter contract award).  Describe howyour company will integrate the JTRSLink 16 waveform into a suitable testenvironment to allow complete testingof modified software.3.7 Experiences writing test procedures,developing and updating testemulators, simulators and other testsupport software and hardware fortesting JTRS waveform software.3.8 Knowledge of JTRS API standards,JTRS UIC, JTRS NED WaveformPortability Guidelines, JTRS SoftwareStandards, JTRS SCA requirements,and interoperability certificationrequirements.3.9 Describe your experience with Link16 TADIJ message types and Link 16net structures.  In addition commenton how your company would redesignthe TADIL J message for OTAR, OTAZand Link 16 waveform processing tosupport Cryptographic Modernization.4.0 RESPONSESInterested parties should respond tothis RFI with a white paper.

Ensuring high levels of quality, performance, and cost/price controls are maintained, it is envisioned the contractor(s) will provide the necessary management, supervisory, and project personnel to direct, administer, and report on these services on a daily basis.  It is expected the performance under this (these) contract(s) shall include nonspecific, urgent, requirements from various locations throughout the globe, as well as mature (clearly defined) requirements for areas such as: areas of conflict,  other OCONUS locations as well as CONUS.  Performance, deliverables, and exact location(s) of the work will be conveyed to the successful offeror(s) by the Contracting Officer or his/her designated Contracting Officer Representative(s) (COR).  The contract(s) will require personnel who can perform monitoring, transcribing, translating, and interpreting (listening, writing, speaking, and reading) from the targeted language to English and vice versa, and occasionally, from one targeted language to another targeted language  Contracted linguists performing under this (these) contract(s) may at some time be required to perform any of these duties.  However, it is understood no single individual can perform all tasks with equal facility.  Language proficiency testing is required in the source language(s) and English for all levels of linguists in the four basic communications skills: listening, reading, writing, and speaking.  Evidence of language proficiency testing with acceptable results is required prior to assignment and shall be retained for audit purposes.  Additionally, a number of contractor personnel will require security clearances at or above SECRET, to include Top Secret SCI with polygraph..  It is also desirable for contractor(s) to manage linguists to a secondary level of mission related skills, such as medical, Legal, Engineering, and Military fields in order to ensure the right skill set is applied to each mission.  Linguist will be deployed to targeted area(s) with adequate contractor management staff and will be required to undergo the necessary screening, vetting, clearing, and approval processes prior to, during, and following deployment to the host nation.  <BR><BR>This is a request for information only.

General questions on Governments acquisition approach<BR><BR>1.	If you were the Government, how would you structure this acquisition and subsequent contract vehicle?<BR>2.	What quality assurance standards/methods do you think best for management and surveillance of linguist services during the three general phases of military operations (pre-deployment, deployed, and post-deployment)?<BR>3.	What do you see as the optimal strategy for meeting a global linguist service requirement?<BR>4.	For linguist related service contracts, what should we look for as success or failure indicators?<BR>5.	If the Government offered an incentive program for being responsive (meeting fill rates), quality assurance (right skill set, to right location, at right time), and/or cost controls, what incentive (or combination of incentives) would attract you most to meeting linguist service requirements?<BR>6.	Are there other incentives, which motivate a linguist service provider to improve performance while maintaining cost controls?<BR>7.	Are there general terms and conditions in federal contracts which would hamper your performance or creativity in bidding for a linguist services type contract?<BR>8.	What duties should be included in a linguist job description in order to provide the best support to the customer?<BR>9.	What socio economic considerations would you recommend the government contemplate and how would you structure the suggested considerations?<BR>10.	Would your company be receptive, if asked, to have your linguist program management and operations personnel meet one-on-one with Government representatives to discuss commercial and industry best practices, performance metrics and measurements, innovative delivery methods for the required linguist services, and incentive programs which providers have found particularly effective?  Such a meeting would allow the Government to conduct the market research needed to craft an innovative acquisition strategy for a mission-critical agency need.  Please ensure the point of contact identified in the Company Information below is the appropriate linguist program management/operations individual who can address the above issues.  <BR><BR>II.	Host Nation Compliance: <BR><BR>1.      Do you currently hold required licenses (i.e. Ministry of Interior (MOI) and Ministry of Trade) for being a provider in target countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan?<BR>2.      If you do not hold a current MOI license, what is your plan for obtaining one?<BR>3.      How does a MOI requirement, which limits the number of employees you have operating in the Host Nation, affect your ability to contract for additional theater-wide efforts?<BR>4.      How many people by category--Host Nation, Third Country Nationals and US Citizens--do you currently employ for contracts in Host Nation?<BR>5.       Are you presently performing as a prime contractor for any US Government Agency in support of a major operation such as Iraq or Afghanistan?  If so, describe the scope of the effort.<BR>6.      Are you performing as a subcontractor for a US Government Agency in support of a major operation such as Iraq or Afghanistan?  If so, describe the scope of the effort.<BR> <BR>III.                 Present ability to Contract with the US Government<BR><BR>1.      At any time in the last two years, have you been prohibited from contracting with any US Government agency?<BR>2.      Have you in the last two years been the subject of any action to suspend, debar, or terminate for cause with the US Government?  If so, please explain.<BR>3.

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER DACW01-03-C-0017.<BR><BR>Using Recovery Act Funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number DACW01-03-C-0017, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Walter F George Lake, ACF Rivers Project, Fort Gaines Georgia, awarded to Anderson Construction Company, 58 Crozier Lane, Fort Gaines, Georgia. Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds were previously added to the basic contract. The contractor will develop specifications and perform building rehab services including replacing lighting, doors, ceilings, siding, and replacing the roof at the ACF Rivers Project Management office and other upgrades for energy efficiency and to reduce maintenance at G W Andrews Lock.  Work also includes installing a waterborne toilet at Abbie Creek Park.  The modification will also incorporate contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds. <BR>This existing contract must be used because: 1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared. The extent of the work and the resources required can not be fully determined prior to removal of old units. 2) This contract enables work to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on the visiting public, commercial shipping and the economy. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.<BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>US Army Engineer District, Mobile, P.

<p>RESPONSES: The BAA will remain open for submissions for one year after the initial posting date of this announcement. An offeror may submit more than one concept aligned with the technologies listed above. Responses are requested from any responsible organizations including those from private industry, academic institutions, research institutions, and non-profit organizations. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government needs may submit an abstract that shall be considered by USSOCOM. Initial abstracts may be submitted at any time after issuance of this BAA up to the expiration date of the BAA. Interested parties are invited to submit a one page abstract for preliminary consideration.</p>
<p>ABSTRACT FORMAT: The format for the one page abstract is as follows: One single-sided page excluding cover page. Paper size 8.5 x 11 inch paper, 1" margins, single spacing, Times New Roman font (10 point), and Microsoft Windows or .PDF format. The cover page should be labeled ABSTRACT and shall include BAA number, abstract title, and company information to include address, phone, fax, and technical contact with email address. The body of the abstract should contain a narrative description of the effort and applicability to the identified areas of interest to be derived as a result of the effort. This should include the following: Technical Concept, Key Technical Characteristics, Perceived Operational Benefit, Technical Readiness Level, Performance Period, and any other technical data/information to be conveyed for consideration.</p>
<p>ABSTRACT EVALUATION: Abstract submissions will be reviewed every 30 days. Each offeror will be notified of the review results for their abstract. If the topic is found to be of interest to USSOCOM, a white paper will be requested.<br />WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS: Abstracts receiving favorable review will result in a request to submit a white paper. White papers will be evaluated against the criteria stated below. White papers are not evaluated against each other since there is no common work statement; however, funding constraints (i.e., funds availability) may require a prioritization process and affordability considerations may enhance or preclude award. Decisions will be based on application of the evaluation criteria within each program area based on peer or scientific review. White papers may be formally evaluated by one or more individuals possessing necessary qualifications and experience in the technical area, which may include evaluation by contractor support personnel possessing specialized expertise. White papers submitted under this BAA are protected from unauthorized disclosure. All personnel evaluating white papers are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement prior to white paper receipt or review.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPER EVALUATION CRITERIA: Relative Order of Importance: Factors 1 and 2 are of equal importance. Factors 1 and 2 are significantly more important than factors 3, 4, 5, and 6 which are all of equal importance. <br />1. TECHNICAL MERIT: Overall scientific and/or technical merit of the proposal.<br />2. RELEVANCE/IMPORTANCE: Potential contribution toward advancing USSOCOM mission objectives and interests, in particular CAS/TIC.<br />3. CAPABILITY: The offeror's capabilities, capacity, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these that are an integral factor for achieving proposal objectives.<br />4. PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS: The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of key personnel (e.g., Principal Investigator (PI), Subject Matter Experts, Scientists, Engineers, etc.) who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives.<br />5. RISK: Technical and schedule risk assessment and/or mitigation measures in relationship to potential payoff.<br />6. COST: Affordability, cost realism, and reasonableness.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPER FORMAT: The format for white papers follows below. White papers that do not satisfy these form and format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation. All submissions shall be in the English language. White papers shall be submitted electronically; a paper copy is not required. Electronic copies should be in PDF (preferred) or Microsoft Word. A white paper should be a brief summary. It introduces the idea, solicits interaction with government, and avoids the expense of generating proposals that have little likelihood of selection or award within this BAA. White papers should summarize the planned proposal and clearly articulate the innovative concept or technology development and demonstration being proposed. White papers should contain a cover sheet (clearly marked White Paper), a ten-page (maximum) summary of the technical idea, a one-page cost summary, and a one-paragraph (150-200 words) abstract of the white paper as a whole. All pages should be printable on 8.5 by 11 inch paper; type not smaller than 10 point using Times New Roman font. The page limitations for white papers include all figures, tables, and charts. No formal transmittal letter is required. Offerors should segment their proposed efforts into an initial Phase 1 period of 6 months or shorter to explore and validate the technical feasibility of the concept, and one or more additional phases as optional efforts culminating in a technology demonstration / utility assessment. The total effort including options should not exceed 12 months. Successful initial phases will have a greater likelihood of receiving funding for subsequent optional phases.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPER AND ABSTRACT EVALUATION AND NOTIFICATION: Electronic acknowledgment of receipt of all abstracts and white papers will be made. Abstracts and subsequent white papers will not be returned. The BAA will remain open for submissions for one year after the initial posting date of this announcement. Abstracts received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated. USSOCOM will review and respond electronically to each requested white paper within 60 days of submission; however, USSOCOM reserves the right to review and respond as white papers are submitted. Upon completion of the evaluation, the offeror will be notified that 1) the white paper has merit and will be considered for award as funds become available, or 2) the white paper does not contain sufficient relevance to the SOF mission to be of interest to the command.</p>
<p>PROPOSALS: Any invitation to submit a full proposal will be made on the basis of the white paper evaluation criteria above and program balance that provides the best value to the Government. If an invitation is made, it will be made by letter signed by a warranted Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>FUNDING: There is currently no funding set aside for awards made under this BAA. Should a topic be found of interest, funding shall be sought for that effort.</p>
<p>AWARDS: All awards made as result of responses to this announcement shall be publicized in accordance with FAR 5.301. Awards will be subject to the availability of funds. Award instruments may take the form of a procurement contract, grant, or agreement depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors. The Government reserves the right to 1) select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received, and 2) incrementally fund any award instrument. Offerors will not be reimbursed for proposal preparation costs. Offerors submitting white papers and follow-on proposals are cautioned that only the Contracting Officer is authorized to obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds.</p>
<p>PROPRIETARY DATA: The government desires unlimited data rights to all information and products generated under contracts that result from this BAA. When an offeror must include proprietary data in order to fully communicate their concept, the offeror must clearly mark and identify any proprietary data that the offeror intends to be used only by the Government for evaluation purposes. The offeror must also identify any technical data contained in the white paper that it is furnishing to the Government with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure. In the absence of such identification, the Government will assume to have unlimited rights to all technical data in the white paper. Records or data bearing one of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations System (DFARS) approved restrictive legends may be included in the white paper. It is the intent of the Government to treat all white papers as privileged information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation. The offerors are cautioned, however, that portions of the white papers may be subject to release under terms of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.</p>
<p>USE OF NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled for administrative purposes by a support contractor that is bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by USSOCOM from non-Government consultants and advisors who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Non-Government personnel will not establish final assessments of risk, rate, or rank offerors' proposals. These advisors are expressly prohibited from competing for BAA awards. All administrative support contractors, consultants, and advisors having access to any proprietary data will certify that they will not disclose any information pertaining to this announcement, including any submission, the identity of any submitters, or any other information relative to this BAA, and shall certify that they have no financial interest in any submission evaluated. Submissions and information received in response to this BAA constitute the offeror's permission to disclose that information to administrative support contractors and non-government consultants and advisors.</p>
<p>ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any Government office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number. Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.5, must be disclosed. This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then the offeror shall so state in the affirmation.</p>
<p>SUBMITTAL ADDRESS: All abstracts and requested white papers shall be sent electronically to the following email address: BAACAS_TIC@socom.mil. The subject line for all email submissions shall state the applicable Area of Interest as listed in this notice. Submissions received by USSOCOM but not submitted specifically to the BAA may not be considered under the BAA.</p>

<p><br />L-514 CONTRACTOR PASSES<br />Procedures for contractors obtaining entry authority on Malmstrom AFB: Access for contractors entering Malmstrom AFB may be permitted providing the contractor follows the procedures set forth below and 341 SW Pamphlet 31-103 (available at Visitor Control Center) and meets the security standards including applicable background checks. Access for contractors entering Malmstrom AFB will be permitted to contractor personnel who obtain proper credentials and passes through one of the two main entry points (Commercial Gate on 2nd Ave North or 10th Ave North Gate). Retired military members and dependents of active duty or retired military members who are employed by your company may use their retired or dependent Armed Forces Identification Card to enter Malmstrom AFB; however, they must still obtain a contractor's pass through the Visitor's Center located outside of the Commercial gate. In the event of increased force protection conditions, retired military members and the dependents of active duty or retired military personnel without a contractor's pass, will be required to follow the security measures enacted under the respective force protection condition. Contractor's badges will be obtained in the following manner:<br />a. First, contractor employees must already have adequate identification such as a driver's license or company ID card. This identification should include, as a minimum, the physical description of the individual (i.e., height, weight, date of birth, eye and hair color), a picture of the individual, and the individual's signature.<br />b. Upon award of a contract, the contractor will be issued an Entry Authorization List (EAL) by the contract administrator in 341 CONS. The contractor will need to submit the required information for the EAL to the contract administrator in 341 CONS prior to contractor personnel coming to Malmstrom AFB.<br />c. Upon initial entrance to Malmstrom AFB, contractors' personnel shall obtain a contractor's pass from the Visitor's Center where the EAL will be filed. Contractor passes will be valid for the duration of the contract. The contractor will be required to resubmit a new EAL upon exercising option years, contract renewals or extensions, and adding or subtracting names to and from the EAL.<br />d. If contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB for time(s) outside of the performance period of the contract (i.e., administrative issues, warranty issues, site visits), they will need to be vouched on by the customer, or supporting agency, of the respective contract they are associated with.<br />e. At the time contractors initially come to the Visitor's Center to obtain their pass, they will be required to fill out DD Form 1172, which the Visitor's Center will issue and maintain.<br />f. It will be the sole responsibility of the contractor to renew, remove, and add employees to the EAL. In order to renew, remove or add names to the EAL the contractor must follow the same processes as if they were submitting the EAL for the first time.<br />g. For existing contracts that are already in progress, contractors will follow the procedures mentioned above if any person(s) need a new or updated pass.<br />h. Any other instances where contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis in which the customer, or supporting agency, will need to sponsor contractor personnel entry and accompany them while on base.<br />i. All passes must be returned to 341 SFS (Visitor Center) upon completion of the contract, or personal no longer require access to the installation, under performance of this contract.<br />j. Vehicles owned by your firm will be permitted entry to Malmstrom AFB if they are conspicuously marked with your firm's name or logo, with the exception of magnetic signs, when you have contract requiring performance on the base. If your vehicles are not so marked, it will be necessary for you to obtain a temporary vehicle registration for each vehicle to be operated on Malmstrom AFB. This registration is accomplished by the contractor or designated representative at the Pass and Registration Section. Proof of ownership and a current valid driver's license are required for vehicle registration. You or your representative will be required to certify in writing that your firm carries insurance on your vehicle or vehicles as outlined below:</p>
<p>i. $10,000 Property Damage Liability.<br />ii. $25,000 Personal Liability for each person.<br />iii. $50,000 Personal Liability for each accident.</p>
<p>(Note:) Each vehicle must be insured for the above limits if not already covered in your contract.</p>
<p>(xiv) DPAS Rating does not apply to this acquisition.<br /><br />(xv) Quotes, along with a completed copy of attachment 4 (Pricing List), are required to be received NO LATER THAN 12:00 PM MST, Monday, 30 Nov 2009.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) <strong>The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred</strong>, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) <strong>o Have, o have not,</strong> within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) <strong>o Are, o are not</strong> presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) <strong>o Have, o have not</strong>, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) <strong>o Are, o are not</strong> presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) <strong>o Have, o have not</strong>, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) <strong>o Are, o are not</strong> presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) <strong>o Have, o have not,</strong> within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<DESC>Description: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be utilized. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a small business set aside under NAICS code 811118. Solicitation reference number W912JC-10-R-5701 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the overhaul of the MT654 Allison Transmission NSN: 2520-01-117-3010. See NMWR reference 9-2520-594 attached.

Contract Type and Estimated Quantities: This solicitation will be awarded as an Indefinite Delivery  Indefinite Quantity Firm Fixed Price contract. The base year contract begins approximately February 2010 thru January 2011 with the option for four additional one-year periods. The additional one year contract options are exercised if the product performance and customer service from the contractor is deemed to be of a satisfactory or better nature. The estimated quantities: Maximum quantity 150 each 1st contract base year and 150 each thereafter for each option year exercised with a minimum qty of 40 per year. Offerors shall base proposals on the stated guaranteed minimum quantities for the purpose of a contract award. Any discounts offered based on quantities greater than the stated minimum shall be welcome but not considered for the purposes of the contract award. The contract award will be made to the top two submitted RFPs total average of the base year and all option years provided the proposals and the First Article has been designated technically acceptable. 

Schedule: Offerors shall submit a delivery schedule in accordance their anticipated monthly capabilities.  Offerors should have the capability to overhaul at least the estimated maximum of 150 (per vendor) MT654 Allison Transmissions in accordance with Allison Standards within the prescribed contract year (max required 25 per month). Actual or perceived misrepresentations of the offerors overhaul capacity discovered prior to or after contract award are subject to being deemed non-responsive or contract termination for the convenience of the Government. 

-	Awarded contractor will also provide a weekly status report of the MT654 Transmission overhaul. The status report will include but is not limited to nomenclature, P/N, order #; qty left on order, qty at facility, lead time and estimated delivery date. Pick-up and deliveries will be made at the KS-Readiness Sustainment Maintenance Site (RSMS), Camp Funston-BLDG 1598, FT Riley, KS 66442. 

Technical: Offerors must submit a proposal that includes detailed information about their overhaul process as a requirement of technical acceptability standards to be considered for an award. A proposal that merely reiterates or promises to accomplish the requirements of the RFP will be considered non-responsive. The OEM holds the proprietary technical specifications. This acquisition of services is restricted to qualified Allison Transmission technicians with the required tool pack for service and overhaul process in order to maintain the quality of the MT654 Transmission. Any offerors submitting a proposal without the appropriate qualifications will be dismissed without discussion as not being technically acceptable to the Governments requirements. Firms that recognize and can service the required item described above are encouraged to submit a proposal. 
  - Mandatory replacement parts irrespective of MT654 Transmission Core condition (see attached).  
  - Transmission will be painted (color and type to be determined).
  - Each overhauled transmission shall contain its own Dynamometer report.
  - Explain process required to overhaul the MT654 Allison Transmission from receipt of core to Dyno test and shipment back to KS-RSMS for technical evaluation of proposal.
  - The awarded offeror shall designate one overall Point of Contact concerning all aspects of this contract responsible for communication concerning quality issues and overall contract performance.
  - On time deliveries to include the ratio of successful inspected items in comparison with Quality Deficiency Reports (QDRs). An awarded offerors expected learning curve shall result in less than a 5% monthly QDR report of which is averaged on an annual basis to assist in determining if option years will be extended. The Government recognizes and expects the learning curve to vary between offerors and is taken into consideration. 
Cost: The award will be determined by the offer that is Lowest Price and Technically Acceptable. A technically acceptable proposal is one in which the contractor meets all requirements listed in the solicitation. Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly explained in the price proposal.  For example, if unique and innovative approaches or conditions are the basis for an unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented.  
-	Delivery costs of the MT654 transmission shall be borne by the awarded contract offeror to and from the KS-RSMS and therefore offerors should take this into consideration when submitting a proposal. The proposal should include details concerning the shipping method of the transmission cores. The KS-RSMS will provide transmission cradles for the purpose of shipping to and from the KS-RSMS facility if requested in the proposal by the offeror. Returned Transmissions should be sufficiently covered or crated to protect the completed cores against miscellaneous damage. 

First Article: First article to be provided to customer (KS RSMS) within 15 working days of core pick up for evaluation. Successful inspection of first article by KS RSMS is required prior to award. The submitted proposal shall include the cost of the first article but this cost is not included in the final award determination. Any offeror that has previously performed this service for the KS-RSMS within the past two years in a technically acceptable manner is exempt from the first article requirement. First article approval will be in accordance with FAR 52.209-3 for which paragraph a-g will apply.  

Clarification of Standards: This overhaul procedure is required to return the MT654 Transmission to a FULLY SERVICEABLE condition IAW Allison Transmission overhaul standards. The transmission will be rebuilt to all OEM torques and settings; therefore items received for repair will NOT be reconfigured to cause a change in the model designation. This procedure is NOT a reconditioning as defined by FAR PART 52.211-5 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS, which means restored to the original normal operating condition by readjustments and material replacement as needed. The mandatory replacement parts attached to this solicitation do apply (ref NMWR 9-2520-594). 

-	It shall be the obligation of the offeror to exercise due diligence to discover and to bring to the attention of the Contracting Officer at the earliest possible time any ambiguities, discrepancies, inconsistencies, or conflicts in or between the specifications and the applicable drawings or other documents incorporated by reference herein. The offeror may, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, be asked to provide clarifications regarding their proposals. The offeror shall be held responsible for the validity of all information supplied in their proposal. Should subsequent investigation disclose that the facts and conditions were not as stated; the proposal and/or award may be terminated for the convenience of the Government due to non-technical acceptability of Government requirements.

Warranty: KS RSMS is requiring the awarded contractor(s) to provide a 1 year warranty from date of installation or 18 months from date of shipment from supplier (whichever occurs first) for each overhauled MT654 transmission core. The warranty will only be applicable to the workmanship and not misuse. If the transmission fails incoming inspection the KS RSMS will log the failure on a quality deficiency report (QDR) and contact awarded contractor(s) for corrective action. The contractor(s) must be able to service these units within the warranty period on-site within the Continental United States and should consider this factor when submitting a bid.

Past Performance: Information should include a list of prior contracts for this item awarded within the past 3 years if applicable. The information shall include a valid point of contact, mailing address, telephone number, contract number and dollar amount. It is incumbent upon the offeror to include the most current contact information of prior contracts.  Not doing so or having negative past performance with a previous vendor may cause the offeror to be found not technically acceptable and removed from consideration of award. 

-	Past Performance while not a sole indicator of the offerors ability to meet the Governments requirement, it is still a consideration factor to assess an offerors technical acceptability (i.e. the lowest price that meets the Governments technical requirement will be awarded). The responsibility of clarifying corrected past performance issues is solely incumbent upon the offeror. The final determination is at the discretion of the Contract Officer making the award.  

Proposed Deviations: If the offeror takes exception to any of the requirements specified in this solicitation, the offeror shall clearly identify each such exception and include a complete explanation of why the proposed deviation was made and what benefit accrues to the Government. All deviations should be accompanied with supporting rationale and clearly labeled "Deviation". An addendum is only required if the offeror takes exception to any requirement in the solicitation. (The Addendum does not have a page limitation, but shall only include information relevant to exceptions taken to the solicitation requirements.)  The Government will assume an offeror takes no exceptions to any solicitation requirement if the offeror does not submit an addendum identifying proposed deviations. Offerors are advised that solicitation requirements are not necessarily negotiable and such deviations may render an offeror's proposal unacceptable and ineligible for award.  

Proposal Preparation Instructions: These instructions prescribe describe the approach for the development and presentation of the proposed data. The proposal shall include all of the information requested in the specific instructions. Failure to include all information requested may result in the dismissal of a proposal as non-responsive. This RFP does not commit the Government to pay costs incurred in preparation and submission of proposal information. 

-	Proposal format is subjective to the offerors preferred format that is orderly and sufficiently documented. Offerors are cautioned to submit enough information to enable the Government to fully ascertain each offerors capability to perform all of the requirements for a fair and thorough evaluation. It is requested that the priced items of the proposal are listed separately on their own page.
  
-	All commitments made in the proposal may become a part of the resultant contract. The data submitted with each proposal should be complete and concise, but not overly elaborate. Any materials submitted but not required by this solicitation, (such as company brochures), shall be relegated to appendices. Excessive reliance on promotional brochures is discouraged. Elaborate format and binding are neither necessary nor desirable. Submit proposals to the attention of CPT Robert M. Parvin, 2737 Kansas Ave, Topeka, KS 66611 or via e-mail at robert.parvin@us.army.mil not later than 2pm Central Standard Time on the designated response date listed in this Synopsis/Solicitation.

Amendments: The right is reserved, as the interest of the Government may require, to revise or amend, the solicitation, specifications prior to and/or after the date set for receipt of proposals, as necessary.  Such changes, if any, will be announced by an amendment or amendments to this Request for Proposal.  All information relating to this RFP, including pertinent changes/amendments and other information applicable prior to the date set for receipt of proposals will be posted on the following website: www.fbo.gov.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-P45924 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposals incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37. This is a small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that the Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurements, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

CONDITION OF EQUIPMENT: - The Contractor accepts responsibility for the equipment described in Section C, paragraph I., in "as is" condition.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma City-Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC/PKEA) at Tinker Air Force Base Oklahoma, intends to negotiate a time and material (T&amp;M) price contract for the acquisition listed below.</p>
<p>Proposal Submission Information:<br />Offers are due by&nbsp;23 November 2009, 4:00 P.M., Tinker AFB OK central standard time (CST). Contact the following individual for information regarding this solicitation:</p>

The responsible offerors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) database (available at: http://orca.bpn.gov/) system per FAR 52.212-3, and submit a completed copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their quote. Offerors must also be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database (available at: www.ccr.gov) per FAR 52.212-1. Lack of registration in CCR will qualify contractor as ineligible for award. All responsible sources may submit a quotation in response to this solicitation, which shall be considered. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), for a firm fixed type contract. The Oklahoma City-Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC/PKEA) at Tinker Air Force Base Oklahoma intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government (best value).</p>
<p>Number of Contracts to be Awarded <br />The Government intends to select one contractor; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals/quotes and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>Rejection of Unrealistic Offers<br />The Government may reject any proposal/quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>

Skids can only be stacked one high. Smaller loads and possibly very small loads can be shipped at the discretion of GPO, so smaller trucks can be used. The GPO center will unload the trucks and get them back on the road as soon as possible depending on their working hours.</p>
<p>The contract will be used for the truck shipment of Government Printing Office forms only. Each load will be billed separately and a signed receipt of delivery must be returned to the BEP. Delivery costs will be charged to the GPO account.</p>

The truck will not make pick ups or deliveries along the away, but is free to make whatever arrangements they want for the trip back, unless for some reason forms have to be shipped back to the BEP.</p>
<p>Insurance: The trucking company must have insurance to cover the actual cost to produce the forms in case they are destroyed or damaged up to $33,000.00 per skid.</p>
<p>The loading dock at the BEP in Washington can only handle trailers with a maximum height of 12 feet 6 inches from the ground to the top of the trailer and a maximum length of 40 feet. A 42 foot truck with a short tractor may be substituted for the 40 foot truck limitation; however, the BEP is not responsible for any truck that is unable to traverse the interior loading dock that uses a long tractor or is over the 40 foot length recommendation. The trailer should be able to hold up to 22 skids; each skid will be 48 inches x 40 inches on 4 way pallets, over all height of a full skid cannot exceed 56 inches including the height of the pallet.

<DESC>Synopsis:<BR><BR>Request for Information<BR>Medical Education and Training Command (METC) Scheduling Software Solution<BR><BR><BR>Description<BR>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center-Ft. Sam Houston is seeking information on how an interested contractor could meet the requirement to deliver software scheduling solution to assist METC.  METC is seeking a commercial off the shelf (COTS) or modified off the shelf solution. No prototypes or developmental solutions will be considered. <BR><BR>  <BR>Scope of work summary: (Please refer to attached Draft of Performance Work Statement (PWS) for additional information.<BR><BR>The METC requires a fully-hosted, internet-based COTS solution specifically designed to optimize logistics and scheduling for complex, high-volume training environments. The METC intends to initiate a 12 month initial phase to implement the software in view of ascertaining best practices, conducting business process reengineering and developing a methodical center-wide implementation strategy.  <BR>To this end, the successful vendor will be required to provide all of the hardware, software, hosting and professional services necessary to implement a turn-key enterprise-wide logistics, scheduling and training system solution, capable of scheduling all required facilities, instructional personnel and equipment and providing student housing capacity planning and reservation management down to the bed level, maintenance ticket management and tracking student check in/check outs.  The successful vendor will be required to stand up an initial operating capability within 45 days after award and a full operational capability ready for METC data load within 90 days of award.  The successful vendor shall provide an operational readiness up time of 99.99 for the hosted environment.  Additionally, the successful vendor shall provide for backup of the operational database and will provide a instance of the virtualized operating environment, data set and configuration data, that will be maintained within the METC data center virtualized environment.  In addition, the vendor will help identify and document those planning and coordination deficiencies that exist across the enterprise that either impede or reduce the overall timely delivery of effective and relevant training.  The contractor will support the METC in initial software configuration and data loading, Customization of the COTS product shall be limited to modification necessary to configure and tailor the application to METCs unique operating environment.  <BR>Upon the successful conclusion of the base period, the METC envisions that additional requirements will include future integration with existing system such as RITM (Resident Individual Training Management), ATTRS (Army Training Requirements and Resources System), TDC (Training Development Capability) and Blackboard (Learning Management System).  Since no two METC organizations are completely alike in their requirements, the system must be sufficiently flexible to adapt to fulfill future potential needs.<BR>Phased Approach.  It is desired that a three-phased approach be followed. This will allow the METC to evaluate its training workflow in the context of an automated system, refine its logistics processes and implement the enterprise solution.  In all three phases outlined below, the vendor will work with the government representative to propose alternative approaches based on Best Business practices (BBPs) that will allow change requirements to be implemented expeditiously throughout the Period of Performance without significant impacts or project cost.  Weekly meetings with the vendor are required to evaluate, approve, and prioritize enhancement requests. METCs preferred method of software customization will be agile development. Agile development will allow the METC to forge ahead at a rapid pace while providing adequate opportunity to reprioritize modifications as necessary.<BR>PHASE I  Initial Implementation (12 months).  During the initial implementation phase, the vendor will provide the turnkey system (hardware, software, professional services, hosting, training and support, backup and disaster recovery) to implement the system and automate initial METC courses (approximately 2,600 soldiers trained in 2010).  A successful implementation will include loading the necessary POIs (with associated resources, facilities and personnel) and those courses automatically being scheduled by the software via web-configurable business rules.  During the course of implementation, the vendor will document all functional requirements and workflows for these courses in order to support further implementation of the system. <BR>PHASE II  Enterprise implementation (12 months).  Upon successful completion of Phase I, the vendor will be required to travel to Ft. Sam Houston and deliver a formal In Process Review (IPR) to the Project Manager (PM)/Configuration Control Board (CCB) detailing project status, lessons learned and a methodical Phase II implementation strategy.  Given the operational tempo at METC, the PM/CCB will work with the vendor to develop an implementation plan that minimizes organizational disruption during system deployment.  In addition, at the direction of the METC TPOC the vendor will provide the following training classes to designated METC scheduling personnel:<BR><BR>1.	Data load workshop (1 week)<BR>2.	Onsite Classroom Training(1 week/20 students)<BR>3.	Custom Webcast Training<BR>4.	Train the Trainer class (2 weeks/25 students)<BR>5.	Support and Maintenance<BR><BR>PHASE III  Operations and Maintenance (24 months).  Once fully implemented, the system will move to an Operations and Maintenance phase.  The vendor will be required to provide ongoing hosting, help desk support, software patches, upgrades and server administration as well as ongoing support and training.<BR>Period of Performance.  The Period of Performance (PoP) will be for one base year from the date of contract award with three 1-year contract options.  The implementation, outlined in Phase 1 must be concluded no later than twelve months from the date of the contract award.<BR>Contract work location. Work performed in accordance with this PWS shall be at Fort Sam Houston, TX and at off-site contractor facilities.  Systems analysis for modifications, data load, and training will be completed both on and off site as directed by the COR.  Software modifications will be performed primarily off-site at contractor facilities.  <BR><BR>1.1 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. <BR>This is a Request for Information (RFI) announcement solely for information and planning purposes it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.

The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk, Virginia is seeking information on qualified and experienced sources for planning purposes in an effort to derive a contract vehicle that will provide a full range of information technology equipment in a vast array of specifications and associated peripherals.  The Government plans to procure these supplies as a Commercial Item as defined in FAR 2.101.
Authorized users of the proposed contract will be U.S. Naval activities and other U.S. Government agencies in the Virginia Hampton Roads Area.  In addition, U.S. Government personnel from outside the Virginia Hampton Roads Area who are visiting on official business in the Virginia Hampton Roads Area are authorized to utilize this proposed contract.

The contractor must be capable of accepting payment via Government Purchase Cards.  Contractors must certify they will meet the Electronic Commerce Capability requirements if awarded a contract.   Contractors participating on the DOD EMALL must have Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) or compatible encryption software to ensure the security of customer information such as Government Purchase Card (GPC) account numbers.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions and clarify some administrative issues.Question 1.What is the definition of "annual gross income"?   Does that include fees paid out to consultants, reimbursables, etc.?Answer 1.How to calculate average annual receipts and average employment of a firm can be found in 13 CFR  121.104 and 13 CFR  121.106, respectively.Question 2.The project title is "New Emergency Department Building", but the third of the four factors listed discusses "Building including environmental considerations such as asbestos and lead based paint", which we assume has to do with the proposed skybridge connection to an existing building.   Has there been a site plan developed that we could review?Answer 2.There is no known asbestos or lead based paint on the proposed location. There is no site plan, only a proposed location. Question 3.Does the primary design consultant for this project have to comply with the Small Business Standard #541310 as established by the NAICS?  Answer 3.No.Question 4.What is the current annual volume of the emergency department and is there a projected rate of volume growth for the next five years?  Which acuities will the new observation unit primarily treat: cardiac, neuro and stroke, or is the intention to decompress the emergency department?Answer 4.We are still gathering data to drive both of these criteria - it has not been definitively determined for usage. This information will be delivered and discussed with the A/E chosen to perform the design, after selection is made based on the selection criteria.Question 5.Do you expect geotechnical engineering to be included in the scope of work for this solicitation?Answer 5.Yes.  We will need a geotechnical survey performed at the very least for the earthwork and structural.Question 6.The solicitation asks "(b) Record of significant claims against the client because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services."  What does the word 'client' refer to?   Should this read 'A/E team'?  If so, does this refer solely to litigation or change orders during construction per solicitation's qualification above? Answer 6.In this context "client" refers to the building owner.  The reference is to claims, not to change orders.Question 7.Are the observation rooms intended for all categories of the patient population or predominantly for psych use?Answer 7.The observation rooms are intended all categories of the patient population; use to be determined during the design phase of the project. The current intent is to leave all options open for future deliberation; the design will be done by the A/E that is selected from the SF-330's.Question 8.Will there be both ambulance and walk-in entrances? Answer 8.That is to be determined during design. The current intent is to leave all options open for future deliberation; the design will be done by the A/E that is selected from the SF-330's.Question 9.What is the primary purpose of the sky bridge?  Will it serve primarily as a care-giver connection to the existing hospital or is it also for the use of patients? Answer 9.The skybridge is for care-giver and patients.  (The imaging department is located on the second floor in this wing.)
