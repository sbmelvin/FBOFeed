<RESPDATE>090212
<CONTACT>Vallerie M Redd, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2845, Fax 770-488-2670, Email gfj3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), intends to award a sole source contract to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, 2901 Baxter Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2150 for the acquisition of the Analysis of the Association Between Cell Phone Use and Motor Vehicle Crashes.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 611310, Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools. The period of performance for this procurement is 19 months.<br /><br />University of Michigan has three critical characteristics that together make them unique in the field. First, they have access to 10 complete state crash databases. This compilation representing 20% of all states is critical to the success of the project because it provides a large enough database with the necessary diversity (different cell phone bans, different crash severities) to analyze cell phone bans and their effect on crashes among different age groups. Second, the vendor is an expert in young driver behavior. The University has expertise in young driver safety that is a requirement for this project. The mission of the Young Driver Behavior and Injury Prevention Group is to advance the understanding and safety of young drivers, and reduce their injuries and fatalities on the road using a public health approach. They accomplish this by providing a deep understanding of the social, psychological, behavioral, physiological, and environmental aspects of unsafe driver behavior via many years of published scientific research. A particular expertise is the area of the inexperienced, impaired, and distracted driving behavior of teens and young adults. This expertise in young driver distraction is required for the success of this project. Lastly, the vendor bridges the fields of public health and traffic safety. This is crucial to the success of this project. The data come from the traffic safety field, but the expertise in behavior comes from public health. The University has extensive experience in both fields. These three critical characteristics combined make the vendor exclusively situated to conduct this project.</p>
<p>State crash data is collected, managed and compiled at the state departments of transportation; therefore, there are 50 separate databases. This situation leaves researchers with the choice of using only one state's database (which brings small sample size problems to the research), or separately contacting each state of interest, gaining access to the data, resolving issues of database incompatibility, and finally combining data into one useable database. The proposed vendor has current access to 10 complete state data bases that have been readied for analysis; this represents 20% of all states and is not available through other means.</p>
<p>University of Michigan is unique in the combination of critical factors that are necessary for the project to be a success. This project requires access to and experience with state crash data. The strength of the police-collected state databases is that they document all reportable crashes during a calendar year. The University of Michigan's transportation data center has been in operation for 40 years. They are known worldwide for their expertise in compiling, managing and analyzing state traffic crash data. Analysis performed on these databases offers a key decision-making tool for law enforcement officials and policymakers regarding cell phone bans and driving. This decades long experience in crash analysis coupled with expertise in public health and young driver behavior make this vendor uniquely qualified to carry out this project.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-Q-15095 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN September 2, 2012.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<SUBJECT>Acquisition of Analysis of Impact of Graduated Drivers License (GDL) Requirements in North Carolina

<RESPDATE>090212
<CONTACT>Vallerie M Redd, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2845, Fax 770-488-2670, Email gfj3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), intends to award a sole source contract to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 104 Airport Drive, Suite 2200, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-5023 for the acquisition of Analysis of Impact of Graduated Drivers License (GDL) Requirements in North Carolina. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 611310, Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools. The period of performance for this procurement is 19 months. <br /><br />The Highway Safety Research Center at the University of North Carolina has been a leading research institute that has helped shape the field of transportation safety. The University of North Carolina has been performing research analyzing the North Carolina crash database for many years and is familiar with the specifics of the state database.
<p><br />University of North Carolina is an internationally recognized leader in teen driver safety and the effects of graduated driver licensing (GDL). A previous study found that GDL decreases crash risk among new teen drivers (16 year olds), but might increase crash risk for teens who are no longer under GDL (18 year olds). This has serious implications for teen driver policies across the nation.</p>
<p>The current activity will take this research to the next step by analyzing North Carolina data month by month for the years 1991-2008. North Carolina is one of a few states that instituted GDL restrictions in 1997, so their data can be analyzed before and after the law.</p>
<p>Each state is responsible for collecting, managing, and analyzing their police-reported crash data. The result is that there is no nationally mandated way to uniformly perform these tasks. Moreover, data collection changes over time within a state. This makes every state's data different than the next, and different over time within the state; therefore, experience analyzing a state crash database is a uniquely developed expertise. Consequently, a contractor who has not immersed themselves in the North Carolina state crash data over the last several years (study period 1991-2008) would have to develop the expertise needed for this activity before acquiring the expertise needed to perform this contract.</p>
<p>The University of North Carolina is the only one known to possess all of the critical requirements necessary to successfully perform this project.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-Q-15093 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN September 2, 2012.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires
Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to
support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.

listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requirement for gene expression signatures of cancer-prevention activities of Si-Wu-Tang in an in-vitro cell culture system.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking business sources, including total small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, 8(a) certified companies and other than small businesses. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The government is seeking capability statements from businesses capable of performing the gene expression signatures of cancer-prevention activities of Si-Wu-Tang in an in-vitro cell culture system.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The project is part of the on-going Microarray Quality Control (MAQC-III) project, which is also called Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC), Which aims to assess the technical performance of Next-Generation sequencing technology (Next-Gen) by generating benchmark datasets with reference samples and evaluating advantages and limitation of various bioinformatics strategies in RNA and DNA analysis. Microarrays and Next-Gen sequencing represent core technologies in pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics; however before these technologies can successfully and reliably be used in clinical practice and regulatory decision-making, standards and quality measures need to be developed. The MAQC series of projects are helping improve the microarray and Next-Gen sequencing technologies and foster their proper applications in discovery, development and review of FDA regulated products.</p>
<p>1. The Tasks:<br />The contractor shall investigate a potentially new role for the traditional oriental medicine Si-Wu-Tang in cancer chemoprevention. Si-Wu-Tang has been used in Eastern Asia for about one thousand years for various women's diseases and ranks first as the most frequently used Chinese medicines in several surveys. Our previous study using gene expression microarray and Connectivity Map analysis has discovered new mechanisms for this old drug and suggests its potential activity in cancer prevention (Wen, et al. PLoS ONE, e18278, 2011). Its chemoprevention potential will be further assessed in a cancer development model in cell culture. An estimated total of 18 samples (the vehicle control group, the tumor promoter group, the positive control group and the Si-Wu-Tang groups in three concentrations, all in triplicate) samples will be analyzed so that the Government can compare the effect of Si-Wu-Tang with known chemopreventive agents. The tumor promoter is the epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10 ng/ml). The chemopreventive agent serving as the positive control is (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and potent antioxidant in green tea. <br />The Si-Wu-Tang water extract will be tested for its effect on EGF-induced cell transformation in non-cancerous mouse epidermal cell line JB6. Both Si-Wu-Tang and the positive control EGCG will be evaluated on the efficacy in suppressing EGF-induced colony formation in soft agar (anchorage-independent growth assay). Dose-dependent effect and IC50 values will be obtained for EGCG and Si-Wu-Tang. As the JB6 assay has the positive predictive value for in vivo efficacy of chemopreventive agents (Steele et al., J Cell Biochem Suppl 26, 29-53, 1996), the in vitro assay is expected to provide compelling evidence to support our hypothesis. To investigate the potential cancer preventing mechanism, gene expression profiles of Si-Wu-Tang on the JB6 cells using a whole-genome microarray will be compared with previously obtained microarray profiles on MCF-7 cells. Ultimately, the gene expression changes will be used as biomarkers of efficacy of the chemopreventive agents. The government reserves the right to change the quantity of analyses required.</p>
<p>2. Performance standards.<br />The endpoint of the soft agar assay is the number of colonies that grow on each well of the soft agar in a 96-well plate in comparison with the vehicle control and tumor promoter groups. Only cells with carcinogenic properties can form soft agar colonies. The effects of Si-Wu-Tang on suppression of carcinogenesis will be also compared with the positive control EGCG (10 &micro;M) (expect to reduce ~ 60% of colonies).</p>
<p>3. Samples to be analyzed, what will be sent and when the Government will provide them:</p>
<p>An estimated total of 18 samples (the vehicle control group, the tumor promoter group, the positive control group and the Si-Wu-Tang groups in three concentrations, all in triplicate) will be provided by the Government for the Contractor to analyze. Sources of materials and methods of extraction of the raw herbs have been reported previously (Wang et al., J Pharm Biomed Anal 50, 232-244, 2009).</p>
<p>FOB Point Destination. FOB Point of Delivery for Services and Supplies will be the FDA/NCTR located at 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, AR 72079. Payment terms net 15 days after government acceptance of the supplies/services.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:</p>
<p>This work will be accomplished by the contractor within three months upon receipt of the samples from the Government.</p>
<p>The Government will provide all samples by September 15, 2012. The contractor shall run all samples and return results no later than December 15, 2012.<br /><br />The offeror shall furnish sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered instrument and components meet the technical requirements identified above.</p>
<p>Firms believing they can meet the requirements to the above specifications are encouraged to respond electronically with no less than the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Business name, DUNS number, business address, business website, business size status (i.e., SB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone SB, SDB, WOSB, LB), point of contact name, mailing address (if different from business address), phone number and email address;<br />&bull; Sufficient descriptive literature that unequivocally demonstrates that offered products and services meet or exceed above specifications.<br />&bull; At a minimum provide the following:<br />All descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether the service/product offered meets the technical requirements including: technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information, which demonstrates the capabilities of the contractor to meet the requirement. Include the amount of total RNA required for each sample. <br />&bull; The offeror includes documentation of technical competency of the sequencing <br />&bull; Provide a list of prior similar experience in Next-Gen sequencing work and contact information on at least two references that can be contacted that the contractor has provided similar services within the last two years. Name, telephone number, email address, contract number and description of services with dollar amount. <br />&bull; If applicable, identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are also requested.<br />&bull; Provide information if any of these specifications are too restrictive. No response will be considered that the listed specifications are adequate in a competitive environment. <br />&bull; If a large business, provide if subcontracting opportunities exist for small business concerns.<br />&bull; Though this is not a request for quote, informational pricing must be submitted.</p>
<p>The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, not identified in the response. <br /><br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 541380- Testing laboratories; Small Business Size Standard is $14 million.</p>
<p>Interested Contractors must respond with capability statements which are due in person, by postal mail or email to the point of contact listed below on or before August 21, 2012 by 13:00 hours (Central Time in Jefferson, Arkansas) at the Food and Drug Administration, OC/OA/OAGS, Attn: Nick Sartain, 3900 NCTR Road, HFT-320, Jefferson, AR 72079-9502 or email nick.sartain@fda.hhs.gov. Reference FDA1110020.</p>
<p>Notice of Intent<br />Responses to this sources sought announcement will assist the Government in determining whether or not any future requirement similar to this one should be set aside for small business, made available to full and open competition or procure through sole-source acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes<br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). <span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) </span>The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Have, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Have, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>

<p>FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Addendum</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS</p>
<p>I. PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>A. To assure timely and equitable evaluation of proposals, offerors must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications and Performance Work Statement requirements. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The response shall consist of three (3) separate parts; Volume I - Price Proposal, Volume II - Past Performance Information, and Volume III - Past Performance References. You must submit an original and one (1) paper copy. Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government intends to make an award based on the initial offers received, without discussion of such offers.</p>
<p>In proposal volumes, follow the quantity and page limits as follows:</p>
<p>Section, Copies and Page Limits</p>
<p>Volume I - Price Proposal (Bid Schedule) Original + (1) copy No page limit<br /><br />Volume II - Past Performance Information Original + (1) copy 10 pages (*)</p>
<p>Volume III - (Appendix A)<br />Past Performance References Original + (1) copy No page limit (**)<br /><br />(Appendix B)<br />Completed Past Performance Questionnaires Original + (1) copy No page limit (**)</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>* If the offeror is utilizing significant subcontractors, a total of ten (10) additional pages are authorized for all subcontractors past performance information.</p>
<p>** Provide the form at Appendix A of not more than five (5) references of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years as part of the Past Performance Volume III. If the offeror is utilizing significant subcontractors, in addition to the five (5) references for the prime, the offeror may provide five (5) additional references for each significant subcontractor. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will NOT be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. In addition, the offeror is responsible for providing the Government the completed Appendix B questionnaires provided back to the offeror by their references as part of the Past Performance of Volume III.</p>
<p>The paper files will be checked to determine the number of pages and compliance with proposal instructions. Those pages in excess of the limit will be removed from the back of the Volume II and returned by the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) to ensure they are not evaluated. The Government will not keep any pages in excess of the limit. If Evaluation Notices (EN's) are required, page limits may be placed on any responses. Any page limits for responses to ENs will be identified in the letter forwarding the ENs to you. Excess pages submitted in response to EN's will also be removed in the same manner by the PCO.</p>
<p>B. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price. In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), data other than cost or pricing data may be required to support price reasonableness and realism. Data shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5. If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the Offeror shall be required to submit certified cost or pricing data. Should adequate price competition not exist after receipt of proposals, the provisions of FAR Part 15.403-4 shall apply, and the Offeror will be asked to provide certification of cost or pricing data.</p>
<p>C. Specific Instructions:</p>
<p>1. Volume I - PRICE PROPOSAL - Submit Original Proposal and One (1) Copy</p>
<p>(a) Insert proposed price on the bid schedule (Attachment 2) for base year and four (4) option years. A breakout of Grease Traps/Lift Stations can be located on Appendix A of the attached Performance Work Statement (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>(b) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm until <br />31 December 2012.</p>
<p>2. Volume II -PAST PERFORMANCE PROPOSAL - Submit Original Proposal and One (1) Copy</p>
<p>Only information for same or similar type contracts is desired. Provide any information currently available (i.e. descriptive language, letters, metrics, customer surveys, independent surveys, etc.) which demonstrates customer satisfaction with overall job performance and quality of completed projects for same or similar type contracts completed in the last three years. In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems such as extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc. Provide comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. If applicable, provide a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have recent and relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will NOT be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.</p>
<p>3. Volume III -PAST PERFORMANCE REFERENCES - Submit Original Proposal and One (1) Copy.</p>
<p>(a) Only references for same or similar type contracts are desired.</p>
<p>(b) The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed recent and relevant to the requirements of this RFP. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror on the Appendix A and Appendix B forms, the Past Performance Proposal and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Recent and relevant contracts include contracts that meet the recent and relevancy definition cited below. The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have recent and relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition; however, past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have recent and relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will NOT be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.</p>
<p>RECENT AND RELEVANT INFORMATION For the purpose of this solicitation, Recent and Relevant Past Performance is defined as:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - Addendum</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS</p>
<p>I. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD</p>
<p>A. This is a competitive Best Value acquisition using the Tradeoff Process, without technical proposals, with Past Performance being approximately equal to Price. This procurement will be conducted as a Total Small Business Set-Aside for small business concerns eligible under the small business program. The Government will award a contract resulting from the solicitation to the acceptable, responsible Small Business offeror whose proposal conforming to this solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government, with Past Performance being approximately equal to Price. Evaluation criteria are the same for all competing offerors.</p>
<p>B. Offerors shall propose on all items. Any offer that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates service will be provided at no charge may be rejected as nonconforming to this solicitation.</p>
<p>C. Only Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) offers will be evaluated. An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.</p>
<p>D. The evaluation process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Price: Initially, offers will be ranked according to Total Evaluated Price (TEP). The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items including the corresponding CLINs under Options. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items including the options. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness based on prices submitted from competitive proposals, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate. Prices will also be evaluated to determine if they are materially unbalanced. Materially unbalanced prices risk rejection.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance: Using the information provided in the Past Performance Reference Information (Appendix A), completed Past Performance Questionnaires (Appendix B) and other available information, the contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information on all offerors based on the past efforts provided by the offeror and data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.<br /><br />(a) Recent and Relevant Information: For the purpose of this combined synopsis/solicitation, Recent and Relevant Past Performance is defined as:</p>
<p>(1) Recent - Ongoing contracts with a performance history and contracts completed within three (3) years from the issue date of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) Relevant - Performance of work efforts involving Grease Traps/Lift Stations services and management that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation and performance work statement.</p>
<p>(b) The Government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The Government will conduct a performance confidence assessment based upon past performance of the offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements. This evaluation will include the contractor's record of: (A) conforming to the Performance Work Statement and contract requirements, (B) management of work, (C) reasonable, cooperative behavior, performance and commitment to customer satisfaction and (D) quality control. This assessment represents the government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort, based upon the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence.</p>
<p>(c) Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Definitions for Performance Confidence Assessments and Relevancy are as defined below:</p>
<p>Performance Confidence Assessments<br />Substantial Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Satisfactory Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />No Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has no expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Unknown Confidence (Neutral) - No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />Past Performance Relevancy Ratings Definitions<br />Very Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br /><br />Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>(d) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP.</p>
<p>E. Best Value Determination: Offerors will be initially ranked from lowest Total Evaluated Price (TEP) to the highest TEP.</p>
<p>1. If the lowest TEP is determined to be reasonable, and is judged to have an overall Substantial confidence performance rating, that offer represents the Best Value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>2. IF THE LOWEST TEP OFFER IS NOT JUDGED TO HAVE AN OVERALL SUBSTAINIAL CONFIDENCE PEFORMANCE RATING THE EVALUATION WILL CONTINUE AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>(a) If the lowest TEP acceptable offer is reasonable, but does not have a confidence rating of Substantial Confidence, the next lowest TEP, acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable receives a confidence rating of Substantial Confidence overall for past performance.</p>
<p>(b) The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment Best Value award decision by determining if the Best Value to the Government is to pay a higher cost for a higher past performance assessment rating. The Government reserves the following rights:</p>
<p>(1) To award a contract to the lowest TEP offeror who has Substantial Confidence Rating;<br />(2) To award to higher TEP offeror who has Substantial Confidence Rating;<br />(3) To award a contract to the lowest TEP offeror who has at least a Satisfactory Confidence Rating.</p>
<p>3. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in FAR 52.212-1. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of present and past performance information) or respond to adverse present/past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>4. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>5. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers: The Government may reject any proposal that is assessed to be unrealistic in terms of contract requirements, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect lack of competence or failure to comprehend the scope of the requirement. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions with the offerors (other than minor clarification[s]), unless discussions are determined to be necessary. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the Operational Contracting Division, 308 West "D" Avenue, Suite 130, Bldg 260, Eglin AFB FL. Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers. The offeror's initial proposal should reflect their best effort.</p>

<p>FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Addendum</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS</p>
<p>I. PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>A. To assure timely and equitable evaluation of proposals, offerors must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications and Performance Work Statement requirements. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The response shall consist of three (3) separate parts; Volume I - Price Proposal, Volume II - Past Performance Information, and Volume III - Past Performance References. You must submit an original and one (1) paper copy. Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government intends to make an award based on the initial offers received, without discussion of such offers.</p>
<p>In proposal volumes, follow the quantity and page limits as follows:</p>
<p>Section, Copies and Page Limits</p>
<p>Volume I - Price Proposal (Bid Schedule) Original + (1) copy No page limit<br /><br />Volume II - Past Performance Information Original + (1) copy 10 pages (*)</p>
<p>Volume III - (Appendix A)<br />Past Performance References Original + (1) copy No page limit (**)<br /><br />(Appendix B)<br />Completed Past Performance Questionnaires Original + (1) copy No page limit (**)</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>* If the offeror is utilizing significant subcontractors, a total of ten (10) additional pages are authorized for all subcontractors past performance information.</p>
<p>** Provide the form at Appendix A of not more than five (5) references of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years as part of the Past Performance Volume III. If the offeror is utilizing significant subcontractors, in addition to the five (5) references for the prime, the offeror may provide five (5) additional references for each significant subcontractor. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will NOT be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. In addition, the offeror is responsible for providing the Government the completed Appendix B questionnaires provided back to the offeror by their references as part of the Past Performance of Volume III.</p>
<p>The paper files will be checked to determine the number of pages and compliance with proposal instructions. Those pages in excess of the limit will be removed from the back of the Volume II and returned by the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) to ensure they are not evaluated. The Government will not keep any pages in excess of the limit. If Evaluation Notices (EN's) are required, page limits may be placed on any responses. Any page limits for responses to ENs will be identified in the letter forwarding the ENs to you. Excess pages submitted in response to EN's will also be removed in the same manner by the PCO.</p>
<p>B. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price. In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), data other than cost or pricing data may be required to support price reasonableness and realism. Data shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5. If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the Offeror shall be required to submit certified cost or pricing data. Should adequate price competition not exist after receipt of proposals, the provisions of FAR Part 15.403-4 shall apply, and the Offeror will be asked to provide certification of cost or pricing data.</p>
<p>C. Specific Instructions:</p>
<p>1. Volume I - PRICE PROPOSAL - Submit Original Proposal and One (1) Copy</p>
<p>(a) Insert proposed price on the bid schedule (Attachment 2) for base year and four (4) option years. A breakout of Oil/Water Separators can be located on Appendix A of the attached Performance Work Statement (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>(b) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm until <br />31 December 2012.</p>
<p>2. Volume II -PAST PERFORMANCE PROPOSAL - Submit Original Proposal and One (1) Copy</p>
<p>Only information for same or similar type contracts is desired. Provide any information currently available (i.e. descriptive language, letters, metrics, customer surveys, independent surveys, etc.) which demonstrates customer satisfaction with overall job performance and quality of completed projects for same or similar type contracts completed in the last three years. In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems such as extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc. Provide comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. If applicable, provide a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have recent and relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will NOT be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.</p>
<p>3. Volume III -PAST PERFORMANCE REFERENCES - Submit Original Proposal and One (1) Copy.</p>
<p>(a) Only references for same or similar type contracts are desired.</p>
<p>(b) The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed recent and relevant to the requirements of this RFP. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror on the Appendix A and Appendix B forms, the Past Performance Proposal and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Recent and relevant contracts include contracts that meet the recent and relevancy definition cited below. The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have recent and relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition; however, past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have recent and relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will NOT be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.</p>
<p>RECENT AND RELEVANT INFORMATION For the purpose of this solicitation, Recent and Relevant Past Performance is defined as:</p>
<p>1. RECENT - Ongoing contracts with a performance history, and contracts completed within three (3) years from the issue date of this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation posting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - Addendum</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS</p>
<p>I. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD</p>
<p>A. This is a competitive Best Value acquisition using the Tradeoff Process, without technical proposals, with Past Performance being approximately equal to Price. This procurement will be conducted as a Total Small Business Set-Aside for small business concerns eligible under the small business program. The Government will award a contract resulting from the solicitation to the acceptable, responsible Small Business offeror whose proposal conforming to this solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government, with Past Performance being approximately equal to Price. Evaluation criteria are the same for all competing offerors.</p>
<p>B. Offerors shall propose on all items. Any offer that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates service will be provided at no charge may be rejected as nonconforming to this solicitation.</p>
<p>C. Only Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) offers will be evaluated. An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.</p>
<p>D. The evaluation process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Price: Initially, offers will be ranked according to Total Evaluated Price (TEP). The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items including the corresponding CLINs under Options. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items including the options. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness based on prices submitted from competitive proposals, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate. Prices will also be evaluated to determine if they are materially unbalanced. Materially unbalanced prices risk rejection.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance: Using the information provided in the Past Performance Reference Information (Appendix A), completed Past Performance Questionnaires (Appendix B) and other available information, the contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information on all offerors based on the past efforts provided by the offeror and data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.<br /><br />(a) Recent and Relevant Information: For the purpose of this combined synopsis/solicitation, Recent and Relevant Past Performance is defined as:</p>
<p>(1) Recent - Ongoing contracts with a performance history and contracts completed within three (3) years from the issue date of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) Relevant - Performance of work efforts involving Oil/Water Separator services and management that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation and performance work statement.</p>
<p>(b) The Government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The Government will conduct a performance confidence assessment based upon past performance of the offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements. This evaluation will include the contractor's record of: (A) conforming to the Performance Work Statement and contract requirements, (B) management of work, (C) reasonable, cooperative behavior, performance and commitment to customer satisfaction and (D) quality control. This assessment represents the government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort, based upon the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence.</p>
<p>(c) Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Definitions for Performance Confidence Assessments and Relevancy are as defined below:</p>
<p>Performance Confidence Assessments<br />Substantial Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Satisfactory Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />No Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has no expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Unknown Confidence (Neutral) - No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />Past Performance Relevancy Ratings Definitions<br />Very Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br /><br />Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>(d) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP.</p>
<p>E. Best Value Determination: Offerors will be initially ranked from lowest Total Evaluated Price (TEP) to the highest TEP.</p>
<p>1. If the lowest TEP is determined to be reasonable, and is judged to have an overall Substantial confidence performance rating, that offer represents the Best Value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>2. IF THE LOWEST TEP OFFER IS NOT JUDGED TO HAVE AN OVERALL SUBSTAINIAL CONFIDENCE PEFORMANCE RATING THE EVALUATION WILL CONTINUE AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>(a) If the lowest TEP acceptable offer is reasonable, but does not have a confidence rating of Substantial Confidence, the next lowest TEP, acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable receives a confidence rating of Substantial Confidence overall for past performance.</p>
<p>(b) The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment Best Value award decision by determining if the Best Value to the Government is to pay a higher cost for a higher past performance assessment rating. The Government reserves the following rights:</p>
<p>(1) To award a contract to the lowest TEP offeror who has Substantial Confidence Rating;<br />(2) To award to higher TEP offeror who has Substantial Confidence Rating;<br />(3) To award a contract to the lowest TEP offeror who has at least a Satisfactory Confidence Rating.</p>
<p>3. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in FAR 52.212-1. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of present and past performance information) or respond to adverse present/past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>4. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>5. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers: The Government may reject any proposal that is assessed to be unrealistic in terms of contract requirements, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect lack of competence or failure to comprehend the scope of the requirement. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions with the offerors (other than minor clarification[s]), unless discussions are determined to be necessary. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the Operational Contracting Division, 308 West "D" Avenue, Suite 130, Bldg 260, Eglin AFB FL. Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers. The offeror's initial proposal should reflect their best effort.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a request for quotes (RFQ) for commercial items in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-60 (July 26, 2012) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) (July 24, 2012). It is the responsibility of the offeror to check the website, http://www.fbo.gov, for the issuance of any amendments to the solicitation.<br /><br />This requirement is set-aside for small business concerns under NAICS code 511210 (Software Publishing) with a size standard of $25.0 MIL.<br /><br />In order to be eligible for award, offerors <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span></strong> be registered in the System for Award Management database at www.sam.gov, (formerly Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)) prior to award. <br /><br />Offerors interested in responding to this requirement must provide a quote for a degree audit system, to include four (4) one year option periods for maintenance, which at a minimum, meets the specifications listed below. A single firm fixed-priced (FFP) option year order will be awarded. <br /><br /><strong>Statement of Work</strong>: Please see attached.<br /><br />The government intends to award a single firm-fixed priced (FFP) option year order to the offeror representing the best value to the government based on the evaluation factors listed below. Evaluation factors are listed in order of importance, with most important listed first. The government will conduct a trade-off between price and non-price factors. The Government is not required to award to the lowest priced offeror or the offeror quoting the highest technically rated item.<br /><br />The government reserves the right to award without discussions.<br /><br /><strong>Evaluation Factors</strong> (Listed in order of importance):<br /><br />1. Technical and Functional Approach - Offerors must provide product literature and must display a clear understanding of the requirements. At a minimum, the product literature must demonstrate that the quoted item meets the Statement of Work. Information on warranty, training, installation and delivery lead-time must be included in the quote submission. The following criteria will be evaluated: <br />a. Ease of configuration of the system by the user<br />b. Technical Support: With a focus on the qualifications of technical support team and how technical support is provided (emergency configuration changes, phone support, turn-around of questions, etc.)<br />c. Training: With a focus on the type(s) of training provided to customers
<p>Offerors are required to provide examples of on-line training for users and technical staff.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to utilize technical (i.e., trade magazines) and customer reviews/references as part of the technical evaluation.</p>
<p>Quotes submitted by offerors who fail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirement will not be considered further. Quotes submitted by offerors that include the following statement, or similar, without any supporting information, may be determined to not have a clear understanding of the requirement and may not be considered:</p>
<p>"The offeror understands the requirements and the submitted quote has met all stated objectives."</p>
<p>2. Past Performance: The Government shall evaluate the offeror's present and past performance on similar tasks within the past three years. Offerors must provide two (2) customer references for similar work performed. The Government reserves the right to select which reference(s) to contact. The following must be provided for each listed reference:<br />a. Name of client and address<br />b. Name of current point of contact including telephone number, e-mail address and title<br />c. Contract number<br />d. Contract value<br />e. Contract period of performance<br />f. A clear description of the services provided</p>
<p>USU may request additional information at any time.<br /><br />Offerors will have an opportunity to address any adverse past performance history. Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably, but will instead receive a Neutral/Unknown rating for past performance. Offerors must clearly state in their quote if they do not have at least two (2) past performance references. Failure to provide this information may render an offeror's quote non-responsive and may not be considered for award. <br /><br />A strong history of relevant past performance, in the medical school environment, may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable performance. The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternative sources in conducting its assessment of past performance history.<br /><br />3. Corporate Experience: Offerors are required to provide a narrative of their corporate experience in providing document management capabilities to clients.
