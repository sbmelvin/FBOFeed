<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NESDIS Acquisition Division/SAP Team on behalf of the National Ocean Service (NOS), specifically the Coast Survey Development Lab intends to conduct the Maritime Disaster Workshop scheduled for September 2008.

<a href="mailto:kathleen.d.seitz@usace.army.mil">Portland District, US Army Corps of Engineers</a>
<DESC>Introduction: The Columbia River basin has experienced considerable changes in water resource needs and uses.  In addition, significant environmental degradation has occurred within the lower Columbia River and estuarine system.  Modification of the system by human activities has led to a marked change in the hydrologic regime, caused pollution and substantial losses of in stream, riparian and wetland habitats, and a concomitant reduction in fish and wildlife resources.  To date, thirteen salmonid species from this region have been listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  Such listings have broad implications to existing water resource uses, and future developments. Historic losses of 52,000 acres of wetland/marsh habitats, 13,800 acres of riparian forest habitat, and 27,000 acres of forested wetland habitat downstream of Portland have significantly impacted this ecosystems ability to produce and sustain fish and wildlife resources.  Much of this wetland loss can be attributed to the 84,000 acres encompassed by diking districts and the 20,000-acre increase in urban development along the lower Columbia River.  Additionally, habitat forming processes have been substantially altered due to upstream impoundments caused by the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) and downstream pile structures associated with navigation channel maintenance. The science of ecological restoration has defined five strategies that provide guidance for restoration projects (conservation, creation, enhancement, restoration, and protection).  Site specific characteristics and restoration project goals may require more than one strategy be used to accomplish the restoration goal.  Additionally, multiple strategies may be employed at a site to maximize the benefits to the ecosystem.  To date, the use of creation as a form of ecosystem restoration has not been thoroughly evaluated within the Columbia River Basin.  Given the paucity of available sites available for ecosystem restoration from more traditional methods and the emphasis on habitat needs for recovery of ESA listed salmonids we feel it prudent to evaluate all tools available to the regional efforts. Additionally, regional efforts are evaluating the role of large wood within the estuarine ecosystem as it pertains to salmon recovery.  These evaluations are intended to ascertain the potential benefits of piling and pile dike removal to increase salmonid survival in the lower river and estuary.  However, the potential is also there that some modification to piles could add to the ecosystem complexity and be beneficial to salmon and other aquatic animals.  The Portland District has a series of feasibility studies to evaluate the steps necessary to evaluate these concepts and this will be an additional goal as it relates to ongoing efforts and larger regional sediment management needs.  The larger regional sediment management theme will incorporate both ecosystem restoration through habitat creation and piling evaluations into one comprehensive evaluation. LCRGI Project Contract Goal: The goal of this LCRGI contract is to assess the feasibility of ecosystem restoration utilizing the restoration strategy of habitat creation .  Within this context the use of creation as a strategy for ecosystem restoration will be evaluated as a stand along option or as a part of a larger regionally coordinated ecosystem restoration ESA recovery effort. LCRGI Project Contract Objectives: 1.  Evaluate and characterize the physical and biological conditions for a set of tidal wetlands that exist on islands that were formed from dredged materials.  This evaluation will need to take into account the timeline of island creation and habitat formation.  Evaluate a set of dredge material islands that were intended to be wetland habitat and have not shown promise as a means to learn from past experiences.2.  Assist the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District in developing a regional technical work group to that will provide on project tasks.  This team will need to provide planning and policy input as well as technical guidance.  3.  Assist with the development of potential site location guidelines based on the principles of experimental design and scientific literature related to tidal habitat creation.  Input from others in the field will also be warranted. 4.  Work with the Corps Portland District Product Development Team to evaluate support from stakeholders and build interest for more regional collaboration and cooperation of wetland habitat creation as part of the Lower Columbia River Ecosystem Restoration General Investigation Study. LCRGI Project Contract Tasks:  1.  Inventory existing dredge material tidal wetland habitats in the lower Columbia River.  Contractor will review historical T-Sheets and GIS Ortho layers in all reaches of the lower Columbia River to identify wetland tidal habitats that have likely formed in dredged materials.  Contractor will also evaluate at least one island that was intended to be tidal wetland habitat but has yet to form for a lessons learned perspective.  Potential project sites will be examined further using the Portland Districts Engineering Photo Archive to establish evolutionary history from the 1920s to present day.  The inventory will form the basis for future field investigations to verify dredged material played in the formation or intertidal wetlands.  Contractor will work with Corps engineers to evaluate how/why these islands have converted into tidal wetland habitats (physical and biological forming factors).  Deliverable:  A GIS layer and historical photo essay for each of the eight geomorphic reaches in the lower Columbia River with dredged material wetland sites identified. 2.  Contractor will perform site visits to selected dredged material wetlands to make an initial assessment of site conditions, including landscape orientation, size and quality of wetlands, wetland vegetation community structure, and other relevant geomorphic features (e.g., channel formation).  These sites can serve as reference sites for future habitat creation design and provide insight into the range of site evolution patterns in the system. A summary of the sites physical controlling factors (i.e. hydrology, hydraulics) will also provide the foundation for more intensive investigations. Site photos will be taken from established points for project documentation and presentations to partners.  Deliverable: A detailed characterization of dredged material wetland sites in various stages of developmental maturity. 3.  Identify and apply guidelines for locating dredged material habitat creation projects in the lower Columbia River.  Contractor will review literature sources and contact wetland habitat creation practitioners around the United States (particularly other Corps Districts) to identify selection guidelines for evaluating potential project sites. The contractor will also assist the Corps in assembling a technical workgroup (e.g. USACE, Port of Portland, LCREP, CREST, etc.) to review the guidelines and refine them for use in the lower Columbia River. These guidelines will be tested on a set of potential project sites to help identify one or more habitat creation projects for future implementation consideration. Guidelines will include a list of initial testable hypotheses based on literature review and reference site findings from task  Deliverable: Identification, refinement, and application of dredged material habitat creation site selection guidelines with an end goal of selecting one or more project sites for future implementation consideration. 4.  Perform stakeholder outreach to evaluate and build support for including dredged material habitat creation within the scope of the Corps current General Investigations Study.  The contractor will coordinate with the Corps, Lower Columbia River Estuary Partnership, Lower Columbia Fish Recovery Board, Columbia River Estuary Study Taskforce, Pacific Northwest National Laboratories, State of Oregon, State of Washington, and Bonneville Power Administration to build and evaluate support for an increased focus on habitat creation using dredged materials. Habitat creation using dredged materials is referenced in a variety of lower Columbia River planning documents, including NOAAs Estuary Recovery Plan Module, and the Ecosystem-Based Restoration Plan with Emphasis on Salmon Habitat (159 Plan). Recent planning efforts by LCREP and the Port of Portland also support an experimental approach to habitat creation. Contractor will utilize existing relationships with the above partners to draw attention to the Corps General Investigations Study with the purpose of focusing the planning effort on habitat creation techniques.  Deliverable: Outreach and coordination among stakeholders to build and evaluate interest in the initiation of a pilot habitat creation project under the Corps General Investigations Study.   5.  Facilitate focused technical workgroup sessions to discuss initial findings, identify data gaps, and next steps.  Contractor will work with existing Army Corps staff and technical workgroup to review products generated from tasks above and identify additional information needs. Contractor will recruit additional expertise as needed to refine and begin to address these critical uncertainties. Outcome of this discussion will be used to set up an initial experimental design framework that includes an array of testable hypotheses for an array of physical and biological parameters. This task would also include developing an inventory of potential project constraints and how they may be addressed. Deliverable: Technical team meeting summaries, list of critical uncertainties, draft experimental design template.  A Feasibility Working Draft Report containing all deliverables will be compiled.  As this is a feasibility study this report will likely become a working document that will need editing and refinement. RSM Project Contract Goal:  The goal of the RSM project is to explore and document any potential benefits of specific pile structure removal in the Columbia River.  This will include both pilings and pile dikes that no longer serve their intended purpose and upon removal may contribute to ecosystem health improvements.  Removal benefits will be determined by mainly focusing on the improvement of embayment access for juvenile salmonids.  Potential benefits in terms of; improved local sediment conditions, the reduction of salmonid predation, and the potential hazard to navigation; may also be explored.  Some prep work will be done in July 08.  Depending on Columbia River water levels, fieldwork will be carried out in the August/September timeframe RSM Project Contract Objectives: Evaluate and coordinate existing pile evaluation programs and sediment management planning efforts with an eye on a national perspective of Corps pile and pile dike management. RSM Project Contract Tasks:  1.  Review 1987 Value Engineering Report entitled Columbia River Pile Dike Maintenance Phase 1 and existing Lower Columbia River Estuary Partnership GIS layer to focus on one reach of the lower Columbia River and identify a subset of pile dikes in this reach which have the best potential for environmental restoration for further research and evaluation. 2.  Perform field research for pile dikes identified in task 1 to gather data for potential pile dike removal or enhancement projects.  This task will be best performed in low river stage months. Deliverable: Develop a report of findings and draft recommendations for future directions. Experience/Expertise: Planning and wetland restoration experience in the Columbia River and estuary.  Knowledge and experience of ecosystem restoration from habitat creation designed for aquatic species improvements.  Good working relationships with regional state, federal, Tribal, and NGO entities associated with restoration efforts in the Columbia River and estuary.  Experience and a working understanding with regional sediment management planning efforts.  Knowledge of the confinements of the lower Columbia River, elements contribution to the confinements, and an ability to work within a holistic yet confined river system. Schedules: Beginning date for this contract is expected to be by the end of September 2008.  It is expected that as the RSM component of this contract is part of a larger regional efforts the final report will be complete by 30 December 2008.  Given the newness and complexity of the LCRGI component of this contract the final report should be completed by 30 May 2009.

<DESC><p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Core Sound Waterfowl Museum &amp; Heritage Center, 1785 Harkers Island Road, Harkers Island, North Carolina to develop a photo-documentary publication of the information developed during their previous order for gathering, preserving and sharing traditional fisheries knowledge from down east communities in North Carolina. The project scope of work includes: taking a community-based look at both the history and future of commercial fishing in eastern North Carolina, with downeast Carteret County being the focal point. A photo-documentary publication will allow the work to reach visitors to the area, the growing number of new residents to the region, and most importantly, provide an important foundation of research for the next generation of students, writers, researchers, and hopefully fishermen. Delivery of the document is to be F.O.B. Destination to the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, CCFHR Beaufort Laboratory, 101 Pivers Island Road, Beaufort, North Carolina 28516. The period of performance is September 15, 2008, or date of award, whichever is later, through September 14, 2009. In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the central contractor registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract. For information regarding registration in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm. Authority: 41 USC 253(c)(1). The FSC for this is&nbsp;B521 and the NAICS Code is 712110, small business size standard is $6.5 million. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. Core Sound Waterfowl Museum and Heritage Center is the only known source capable of performing the required documentation. The Core Sound Waterfowl Museum and Heritage Center is dedicated to creating a resource that brings together the historical, cultural, environmental, and educational elements needed to preserve the rich coastal fisheries heritage of the down east coastal communities in North Carolina. This project builds on over 10 years of community-based efforts to help indigenous fisheries workers and long-time coastal residents learn to value the economic, cultural and environmental traditions that have shaped the "Down East" coastal communities; and create jobs, businesses and supplemental income opportunities that preserve, interpret, and showcase important coastal North Carolina resources. The partnership with NOAA will enable access to heritage assets that are available only through community-based relationships; and identification and development of sustainable economic development opportunities that protect important traditions that respected and preserved the coastal habitat and ecosystem. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 4:00 P.M. September 8, 2008 will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required items. Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Linda.Mullen@noaa.gov.</p>

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ)

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for professional services as described in the following Statement of Work:  
SCIENTIFIC SERVICES PROGRAM (SSP)
STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

1.	TITLE – 

Noninvasive imaging studies of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics as tools in medical product development and patient care. 

2. GENERAL –

In FDA's view, the applied sciences needed for medical product development have not kept pace with the tremendous advances in the basic sciences.  The new science is not being used to guide the technology development process in the same way that it is accelerating the technology discovery process.  For medical technology, performance is measured in terms of product safety and effectiveness.  Not enough applied scientific work has been done to create new tools to get fundamentally better answers about how the safety and effectiveness of new products can be demonstrated, in faster time frames, with more certainty, and at lower costs.  In many cases, developers have no choice but to use the tools and concepts of the last century to assess this century's candidates.  As a result, the vast majority of investigational products that enter clinical trials fail.  Often, product development programs must be abandoned after extensive investment of time and resources.  This high failure rate drives up costs, and developers are forced to use the profits from a decreasing number of successful products to subsidize a growing number of expensive failures.  As such, the path to market even for successful candidates is long, costly, and inefficient, due in large part to the current reliance on cumbersome assessment methods.  An area of science that has emerged alongside the pathway of medical product development is non-invasive imaging.

Biological imaging, particularly medical imaging, has seen rapid advancement over the last few years and is now widely accepted as both a research tool and as an evaluative and predictive tool in facilitating clinical and reimbursement decisions. Pharmacokinetic/dynamic imaging is well accepted in the medical community to diagnose cancers, identify metabolic disorders and depict marginal perfusion to the brain and heart. The consensus of numerous experts in the field is that is that these tools are not yet well integrated into our current drug development paradigms.  Current paradigms of drug development often fail to include, if even consider, modern testing methods such as imaging and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling.  It is believed that the drug discovery / development process not sufficiently efficient (in cost and time) to adequately address society’s healthcare needs.

Assuming that PK/PD imaging continues to demonstrate positive contributions to the medical product development pathway, there is general agreement that a need will exist to define some common standards: for processes/protocols, for measurements, for analysis methods and for regulatory compliance. Harmonized research protocols should allow pooling of data from multiple centers and studies. Commonly accepted and harmonized methods of measurement should similarly allow interoperable databases to be created and serve as a resource for retrospective data mining to inform future medical product development and also encourage more sharing of resources (data and biospecimens included) researchers in the process. Common methods of data analysis should allow researchers to review large databases with a consistent, high-quality toolset that would be readily acceptable to investigators and regulators. Despite some of the competitive rhetoric, the scientific and industrial communities are looking for constructive alliances where resources can be leveraged and data can be shared.	

Therefore, FDA seeks, under its Office of Scientific and Medical Programs, its public health mission, and its Critical Path Initiative, to grant an award for the development of a multidisciplinary collaborative infrastructure to sustain the aforementioned activities and to support the implementation and initial phases of some of the work described herein. This multidisciplinary collaborative effort is expected to advance the understanding of and development of tools in the fields of non-invasive medical imaging and PK/PD. 

3. OBJECTIVES – 

The goal of this contract is to address some of the hurdles translating promising new medical products (drugs, biologics and medical devices) from pre-clinical phases through clinical phases of development and then to patients.  Safety data acquired in animal studies often fail to translate well into and often time, fall short of predicting responses in first in human studies.  It is expected that this award will help to address, and/or pave the way to effectively address, the extent to which noninvasive imaging studies may be effective in accessing response to therapies in humans: whether through imaging tools to access biodistribution and uptake of the drug follows the same pattern as it does in the animal models, or through PK/PD data that can determine the effect of a therapeutic on a target in humans, whether predictable from the preclinical animal model or not. The studies to be developed will include measurements of drug PK/PD and toxicokinetics/ toxicodynamics. 


4. SPECIFIC TASKS – 

1.	Develop a strategic plan and the key administrative elements for establishment of a scientific collaborative infrastructure to support a series of interdisciplinary projects aligned with FDA’s public health mission

SCIENTIFIC SERVICES PROGRAM (SSP)
STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

1.	TITLE – 

Bridging Scientific and Translational gaps in Nanotechnology and Nanomedicine

2. GENERAL –

In FDA's view, the applied sciences needed for medical product development have not kept pace with the tremendous advances in the basic sciences.  The new science is not being used to guide the technology development process in the same way that it is accelerating the technology discovery process.  For medical technology, performance is measured in terms of product safety and effectiveness.  Not enough applied scientific work has been done to create new tools to get fundamentally better answers about how the safety and effectiveness of new products can be demonstrated, in faster time frames, with more certainty, and at lower costs.  In many cases, developers have no choice but to use the tools and concepts of the last century to assess this century's candidates.  As a result, the vast majority of investigational products that enter clinical trials fail.  Often, product development programs must be abandoned after extensive investment of time and resources.  This high failure rate drives up costs, and developers are forced to use the profits from a decreasing number of successful products to subsidize a growing number of expensive failures.  As such, the path to market even for successful candidates is long, costly, and inefficient, due in large part to the current reliance on cumbersome assessment methods.  In no areas of science are these challenges more obvious than in nanomedicine and nanotechnology.  FDA anticipates that all products under its jurisdiction: drugs, biological therapeutics, biologics, medical devices, combination products, foods, veterinary products, cosmetics and foods, will all be impacted by nanotechnology.  As such, it is incumbent upon FDA to help lead and facilitate efforts that will stimulate innovation in these fields and ensure the safety and effectiveness of nanoengineered products for the benefit of the patients and consumers that use them. 

In the fields of nanotechnology and nanomedicine there is a need to enhance the existing product development toolkit -- containing powerful new scientific and technical methods such as animal or computer-based predictive models, biomarkers for safety and effectiveness, and new clinical evaluation techniques. FDA sees these tools as urgently needed to improve predictability and efficiency along the critical path from laboratory concept to commercially viable nanoengineered products to ensure that basic discoveries turn into new and better medical treatments and other products.  Such tools are also needed for the fast-developing fields of nanotechnology and nanomedicine—fields that have the potential to impact all the products under FDA’s jurisdiction—which has both untold benefits to public health and risks that are yet to be elucidated. 

Soon predicted to be a trillion dollar industry, nanotechnology holds huge promise for the design and manufacture of many types of novel medical products—from devices to therapeutics to combination products.  There remain, however, a number of questions about the behavior of nanoparticles and the potential effects of products containing nanoparticles once they are introduced into complex biological systems.  We need to better understand the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of different nanomaterials, and we need new test methods, characterization protocols, and standards so sponsors can efficiently move nanoproducts from preclinical through clinical development, to commercialization.

An area of critical need in bringing nanoengineered products to patients is that of reproducible and quantitative tools and tests to access the distribution of nano-particulate carriers in the body following systemic administration through any route.  This involves the development of imaging modalities that allow for the visualization of biodistribution over time.  The ability to account for the full administered dose and its fate is paramount to ensure safety. Research into biodistribution is expected to drive and synergize the development of new imaging platforms and protocols that can best exploit the molecularly targeting advantages offered by nanotechnological imaging probes.  These of course will likely contribute to the development of diagnostics imaging techniques and early disease screening as well as improved imaging contrast agents. 

Yet another fundamental scientific gap in translating nanoengineered products from the bench into the clinic is the need to fully elucidate the mechanism of mass transport across compartmental boundaries in complex biological systems.   A full understanding of the basic science of nanoparticles transport in view of these barriers will lead to an improved understanding of their basic biology, improved control over potential adverse effects, and ultimately the development of improved classes of therapeutic agents.  A desired outcome of the work under this contract, and other aligned efforts, is the development of tools that can guide on the development of nanotherapies by predicting where and how fast the particles will distribute, as a function of their size, shape, physical properties, and surface chemistries.  Equally important is the establishment of standards, reference materials and consensus testing protocols that can provide benchmarks for the development of novel classes of materials.  Yet another need in these fields is the realization of an analytical toolkit for nanopharmaceutical manufacturing, accompanied by specification sheets of toxicological, safety, and biodistribution properties obtained through standardized, validated methods.             

Therefore, FDA seeks, under its Office of Scientific and Medical programs, its public health mission, and its Critical Path Initiative, to award a contract for the development of an infrastructure to support a multidisciplinary, multi-phased nanotechnology program and subsequent related studies as identified in: “Seven Challenges for Nanomedicine” Nature Nanotechnology Vol 3, May 2008” (www.nature.com/naturenanotechnology).  Such an infrastructure will include, but will not be limited to, co-development of study priorities, clinical and non-clinical protocols, and publications at specified program milestones related to the scientific and regulatory priorities under FDA’s mission.


 3. OBJECTIVES – 

Nanotechnology raises the need to answer fundamental questions pertaining to nanoparticle characterization, detection, biodistribution, and biological impact and therapeutic effect. Developing safe and effective therapy and diagnostic tools necessitates the integration of nanotechnology with molecular biology, engineering, computational mathematics, chemistry, physics, and the medical sciences. Experts from different fields of discipline will be required to transcend scientific and cultural boundaries of their respective areas of specialty, and work together to translate novel laboratory innovation into safe, commercially viable medical products.  A cogent approach to supersede the apparent translational challenges will come from leveraging robust resources and expertise from multiple sources with common goals.  
     
Safety is the paramount concern as scientists and clinicians develop a generation of nanoengineered materials that confronts and often surpasses the parametric boundaries of conventional methods of characterization, evaluation, and validation. Prudence demands that the innovators of tomorrow’s therapies and diagnostic agents should also shoulder the responsibility, or at the minimum, contribute to the development of tools and methods that provide reasonable evidence of safety. However, nanotechnology presents a duality of challenges in the context of public health and safety. Environmental exposure to nanoparticulates engineered for both medical and non-medical applications is a serious concern. Numerous sectors of industry are also exploiting the unique properties of nanoparticles to engineer the next generation of such products as fuel cells, paints, adhesives, and sporting equipment, without full knowledge of the potential impact that such products may elicit upon the overall health and safety of the general population.  

It is anticipated that the administrative and scientific infrastructure established under this contract will facilitate the development of new tools and methods to evaluate the safety of nanoparticulates associated with clinical administration and environmental exposure. It is anticipated that a multi-disciplinary research team will be required to sufficiently address the scientific demands of this initiative.  Further, it is anticipated that activities under this contract with support and facilitate the implementation of scientific projects under the following areas of priorities in an attempt to bridge translational gaps in moving nanoengineered medical products from the preclinical stages of development through clinical stages and then to commercialization, all with immediate benefit to public health.

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ)

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for professional services as described in the following Statement of Work:  

1.0  Background. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI), the most frequent cause of liver failure in the U.S., is the single most common cause of regulatory action for new drugs, including failure to approve, withdrawal from the market, restrictions on use and warnings to physicians. DILI can be either pharmacological (dose- and time-dependent; related more directly to drug) or idiosyncratic (rare; hypothesized to be related more to the individual characteristics of susceptible patients).
The early detection, mechanistic understanding and mitigation of potential drug safety problems are key objectives of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s Critical Path Initiative, a national effort to find innovative ways to modernize drug development. As part of this effort, FDA seeks to develop an in silico (computer) model of liver homeostasis and DILI. The model would be designed to improve current risk assessment approaches for DILI.
Current preclinical approaches aimed at predicting and mitigating the impact of pharmacological DILI can be significantly improved. Although a consortium of multinational pharmaceutical companies, academics and regulators reports that the “true positive” concordance rate between preclinical studies and human clinical outcome is approximately 70% if toxicity is observed in one or more preclinical species, the concordance rate is only 55% for liver toxicity . Moreover, these figures have not appreciably improved in nearly 50 years , .
To mitigate the potential for idiosyncratic DILI, sponsors of late-stage clinical trails typically screen patient databases for any evidence of impaired liver function (e.g., elevated circulating liver enzymes and bilirubin) that could indicate a high mortality risk in the absence of other causes (“Hy’s Law”). Although this method is indicative of drugs that can cause idiosyncratic DILI, Hy’s Law is not a robust predictive tool. For example, some drugs associated with idiosyncratic DILI do not cause a striking elevation in liver enzymes. Furthermore, data show that most individuals can tolerate or adapt to hepatotoxic compounds, and only rare individuals display a severe reaction. When suspected cases of idiosyncratic DILI do appear after a drug has been approved, it can be difficult for the sponsor/manufacturer and the FDA to clearly separate drug-specific effects from all other possible causes, such as patient-specific risk factors. Analysis tools that can quickly bring regulators and manufacturers to a clarity of understanding are needed to best inform critical decisions that can affect the availability of otherwise beneficial medicines.
1.1  Project objectives. FDA would like to bring the benefits of biosimulation methodologies to the field of DILI. The knowledge gained from doing so is expected to advance the understanding of the inherent toxicity of drug compounds and the variability in the severity of liver injury observed in the clinic. To comprehend the underlying causes of DILI, one must develop a systematic model of liver function that describes and explores the processes that lead to liver injury. The proposed modeling and simulation platform will quantitatively integrate multiple, disparate sets of data into a unified, dynamic, mathematical model of the liver. This model will capture the complex interactions and relative contributions of multiple systems to the onset and progression of DILI. The platform will also enable researchers to propose and develop mathematically explicit hypotheses that link virtual patient phenotypes to a well-defined set of biological processes.  Insights from the model may allow researchers to derive useful preclinical models, develop predictive functional bioassays, useful preclinical models, and candidate biomarkers.  
Current challenge	Anticipated model applications
Improve the concordance between animal models and human clinical response	•	Optimize first-in-human trial protocols by predicting starting doses that allow clinical goals to be achieved in less time, with fewer subjects and at lower cost
•	Identify and prioritize assays that build confidence in a compound’s likely mechanism of action and off target effects
Advance the understanding of liver toxicity in susceptible humans, especially idiosyncratic responses	•	Inform ongoing genomic/genetic screening studies designed to reveal the etiology of DILI
•	Identify candidate biomarkers more predictive of patients at risk

1.3  Acronyms and Definitions.  
DILI – Drug-Induced Liver Injury
2.0  Scope of Work or Scope.  
•	To support these applications, FDA is interested in developing a detailed model of liver homeostatsis and drug injury in both preclinical animal species (i.e., rat) and humans, as defined in Table 1. The model would be expected to advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of drug toxicity, the variability in the severity and susceptibility of liver injury observed in the clinic, and the quantitative translation of animal model responses to human subjects. This knowledge may guide the development of more predictive assays and clinical biomarkers.
•	The model should reproduce the responses of tolerator, adaptor and susceptible phenotypes observed in the clinic, consistent with available validation data for benchmark compounds (especially time course data).
•	Specifically, the work to be funded under this SOW is for the contractor to evaluate the current state of computer modeling and scientific data related to DILI to develop a set of requirements for the eventual computer models in rat and human.  The contractor should provide specific information on the following four aspects of the requirements specifications:
1.	Biological phenomena of interest. The contractor should provide a review of the DILI literature to determine which clinical or preclinical outcomes the model should be capable of reproducing.
2.	Pertinent physiological mechanisms. The contractor should review available scientific literature to identify all relevant mechanisms for DILI
3.	Model architecture. The contractor should examine the scientific literature to develop requirements for the overall architecture of the model relating to how biological phenomena are linked to form a cohesive metabolic system.  This system should contain as many known physiological pathways for DILI as possible to allow for the exploration of multiple hypotheses.
4.	Based on the above project scoping, the contractor will present a detailed model development and tool development strategy, beta testing plan for predictive accuracy, and implementation plan including a budget and timeline for each phase.

<p>! Communications with the meter will be user selectable serial RS232, RS422. The baud rate will be selectable from 1200 to 115,200.</p>
<p>! The ADCP will be capable of operating in a Apolled@ mode. At the end of each averaging interval the ADCP will automatically record the data on the internal recorder. The ADCP will also place the new averaged profile into an output buffer in user selectable ASCII or binary format. The last averaged profile will remain in the output buffer until the averaging time for a new profile is completed. At this time, the contents of the buffer will automatically be replaced with the new profile. Anytime during data collection, the ADCP can be commanded to transmit the contents of the buffer. This will be done by sending a single character command to the ADCP through the serial port. Additional single character commands will be provided to output a date/time string, incrementally adjust the clock by + - one second, and output the ensemble number. These commands can be done as often as wanted without affecting data collection.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to answer questions posed by potential quoters.
Question 1:  
a.	What type of Aramid fiber is being called out specifically (Nomex, Kevlar, Twaron, etc.)?  Also note that there are several different types of each of these fibers (assuming Kevlar:  K29, K49, K100, etc.).  
Answer:  We are looking for a ballistic grade polyaramid.  Based on my knowledge of the marketplace, either Kevlar or Twaron would be acceptable, but Nomex would not be acceptable because it doesn’t have the ballistic resistant properties commonly used in body armor.
b.	Also note that there are several different types of weaves and weights for these fibers (assuming K29: Satin Weave, Basket Weave, 24 oz, etc.).
Answer:  We have previously done work with plain weave Kevlar 129, but it is not our intention to limit this procurement to one particular fiber or weave.  We would like to make this procurement as open and competitive as possible.  It is our objective to obtain armor samples which are representative of what is typically used in the marketplace, but not to use certified models of body armor for research purposes to avoid the appearance of testing commercial products.  A vendor may suggest something which is most commonly used in commercial body armor.
Question 2:  When speaking of laminated fibers, are they laminated together for a thicker, more rigid laminate, or are they left separated for flexibility?
Answer:  We have previously done work with both 2 and 4 ply laminates, but it is not our intent to limit this procurement to one particular fabric.  We would like to make this procurement as open and competitive as possible.  It is our objective to obtain armor samples which are representative of what is typically used in the marketplace, but not to use certified models of body armor for research purposes to avoid the appearance of testing commercial products.  A vendor may suggest something which is most commonly used in commercial body armor.
All terms and conditions of the original solicitation, including the closing date, remain unchanged.
