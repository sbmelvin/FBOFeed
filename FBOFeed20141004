<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) VISN 21, San Francisco VA Medical Center intends to solicit proposals in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12 to provide Housing Support Staff for a 136 apartment building that will house 130 Veterans who are part of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Veterans Affairs Supported Housing (VASH) program.
The VA and the City and County of San Francisco Human Service Agency (HSA) are collaborating to provide housing for Veterans by securing an apartment building in San Francisco. The Veterans in this building fall under this HUD-VASH program.  HUD provides the funding for the Section 8 housing voucher, administered through the Public Housing Authority (PHA). VASH provides case management to assure the success of housing stability of a Veteran moving from homelessness to housing by providing needed support and services.  Veterans will be selected for this program and this particular building through a coordinated assessment process with the Department of Veterans Affairs and the City and County of San Francisco. The HSS staff will work in conjunction with the social work case managers assigned to this cohort of Veterans and other related VA personnel as well as Property Management. The Housing Support Service staff assigned to the Kearney Street HUD-VASH team provides two main functions.  The first component of the HSS staff is to ensure the safety of the tenants and provide oversight of the building.  This is accomplished through font desk services, assuring visitors are appropriately screened, observing and reporting any safety violations and working with property management to assure the building remains safe and secure. 

The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation on or about October 10, 2014 with a closing date for proposals on or about October 24, 2014.   The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors are responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation or any amendments. Large and small businesses as well as non-profit organizations are welcome to respond in the event no Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses or Veteran Owned Small Businesses have the capacity to provide this service.
 No formal solicitation exists at this time. 
All questions shall be submitted in writing to Nandini.Johnson@va.gov.

The NAICS Code 561320, Size Standard $27.5 million. Interested firms should send their information by E-mail to nandini.johnson@va.gov  no later than 12:00 PM Pacific Time October 11, 2014. Information should include the Name of the Company, POC name, phone numbers, email address, DUNS number, and indicate status i.e. SDVOSB, VOSB, Hubzone and/or Small Disadvantage Business.

<AWDNBR>F38604-10-C-B001
<AWDDATE>100114
<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>The 379 Expeditionary Contracting Squadron (ECONS) and 379 Expeditionary Force Support Squadron (EFSS) are the contracting office and reqUiring agency supporting this individual Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>The 379 EFSS has a requirement to provide Food Service to all military, Department of Defense civilian, contractor, joint military/civilian, and transient personnel at AI Udeid AB, Qatar. The purpose of this Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) is'to extend the period ofthe contract using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services for contract F38604-<br />10-C-B001 with one 5-month base period and one l-month option period. Two primary<br />contingencies have created the need to extend the current contract, 1) delays that occurred during pre-solicitation and, 2) a 90 day transition period needed to allow an awardee the opportunity to hire and complete the Host Nation badging process for over 200 employees.</p>
<p>According to FAR Part 17.207(&pound;), the option must have been evaluated as part ofthe initial competition. Contract F38604-10-C-B001 was awarded prior to the implementation ofthis requirement and; therefore, the Option to Extend Services was not evaluated as part of the initial competition. The action will be Firm-Fixed-Price with a Cost-Reimbursement CLIN for parts. The period of performance will be extended for five months from 01 October 2014 to 28<br />February 2015.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>Utilizing the extension of service will provide all preparation and serving of food, bussing of eating areas, maintenance of cooking and food preparation area, and special event service. If this service experiences an interruption, the number of available meals will be limited by the capabilities and number of military personnel available to prepare food. Meals Ready to Eat (MRE) are also available, although current contract:pricing per meal is less than $1.00 compared to an MRE which costs $4.65 per meal. The monthly cost of contracting food services is<br />$460,560; by comparison, the cost of providing the same number of MREs per month would be<br />$2,325,000.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>10 USC 2304(c)(1 ), as implemented by FAR 6.3021 (a)(2)(iii)(B), award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements per ( FAR 6.303-<br />2(b)(4)).<br /><br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>The incumbent contractor is currently the only agency capable of fulfilling the food service requirement at AI Udeid AB as they are the only company with employees in place that have been granted access to the base by the Host Nation Security Forces. Host Nation laws preclude the employees of the current contractor from being hired by a new contractor. The contract awardee will be required to hire new employees necessitating a 90 day transition period to fulfill all Host Nation badging and base access requirements. For this reason, the current contractor is the only available source of the food service requirement. The timeline for the solicitation requires proposal submissions by 04 September 2014, an award date of01 December 2014, and<br />a contract performance start date ofOI March 2015.</p>
<p><br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE</p>
<p>Solicitation FA5702-14-R-004 soliciting full and open competition was posted on www.fbo.gov on 04 July 2014. The solicitation includes a site visit and will close with offers being due on 04<br />September 2014 at 1700 hours local time. Interest in the solicitation has been expressed by nineteen potential offerors.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.303-2(b)(7) the price is determined to be fair and reasonable based on current contract pricing.
