(b) Certification. By submitting this offer, the offeror certifies that it is not: (1) Taking or knowingly agreeing to take any action, with respect to the boycott of Israel by Arab League countries, which Section 8(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)) prohibits a United States person from taking; or, (2) Discriminating in the award of subcontracts on the basis of religion. (End of provision) <BR> <BR>(a) Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The Boycott of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities under the Export Administration Act: (1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli concern, or with any national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country; (2) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to employ or otherwise discriminating against any person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such person; (3) Furnishing information with respect to the race, religion, or national origin of any U.S. person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such U.S. person; (4) Furnishing information about whether any person has, has had, or proposes to have any business relationship (including a relationship by way of sale, purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping or other transport, insurance, investment, or supply) with or in the State of Israel, with any business concern organized under the laws of the State of Israel, with any Israeli national or resident, or with any person which is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in Israel; (5) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports the State of Israel; and, <BR> <BR>(6) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing business with the State of Israel. (b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden ?compliance with the boycott?, and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)?s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) above: (1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements: (i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or, (ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment; (2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation; (3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country; (4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel; (5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individual?s family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and, (6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.

The efficiency and security of the software, hardware, or maintenance currently deployed by the Department is dependent on the renewal of the software, hardware or maintenance to continue the preservation of the current DoS infrastructure. <BR> <BR>An evaluation will be conducted based on best value, where delivery schedule offered, technical compliance as defined by staying as close to the listed specifications as identified, and past performance are more important than price. However, as delivery schedule, technical compliance and past performance become equal, award will be made on the basis of lowest price. <BR> <BR>

<a href="mailto:David.Boyd@hq.doe.gov">David Boyd, Deputy Director, Department of Energy, Office of Acquisition and Project Management</a>
<DESC>Dear Industry Partner,
This is to advise the Department of Energy (DOE) contractor community of the DOE plans regarding contract actions that may be necessary in the event contract funding is affected by a lapse in appropriations.  As you are aware, the budget for fiscal year 2014 has not been enacted and may result in a lapse in the funds designated to purchase certain supplies and services as well as reduction in the Government's capacity to administer DOE contracts. As a consequence of the lapse, certain planned procurements may be cancelled and certain existing contracts may be stopped, reduced in scope, terminated or partially terminated.  Should DOE determine that any of these actions is necessary, the Contracting Officer for each of the affected contracts will provide prompt appropriate notice to the contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions of the affected contract. Notices will contain the direction necessary to comply.  If a contract will not be affected by the lapse in appropriations, DOE does not plan to provide any separate notifications or communications of that fact. Unless a contractor is provided a formal notification to the contrary, all DOE contractors must continue to comply with all terms, conditions, requirements and deliveries specified in their contract(s).  Thank you for your continued partnership with DOE, and for your cooperation as we work together to manage a potential lapse in appropriations. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION: If you have a question, please contact the contracting officer for your acquisition.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) through the Program Support Center (PSC) Strategic Acquisition Service (SAS) intends to award a sole-source contract to Tower Dawson LLC, 2000 Tower Oaks Blvd. Ninth Floor Rockville, MD 20852 for parking services. OASH is in need of 229 parking&nbsp;permits for their occupants to park at the Tower Building located at 1101 Wootton Parkway, Rockville, Maryland 20852. This is a government leased facility for which parking services are needed. Tower Dawson, LLC provides the parking at that facility.<br />The proposed contract may be established through other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This sole source procurement action is authorized when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Per GSA Federal Management Regulation (FMR) Part 102-73.235, federal agencies that need parking must utilize available Government-owned or leased facilities. Federal agencies must make inquiries regarding availability of such Government-controlled space to GSA regional offices and document such inquiries. If no suitable Government-controlled facilities are available, an agency may use its own procurement authority to acquire parking by service contract.<br />The Government intends on acquiring the service as a commercial item using simplified acquisition procedures. HHS anticipates the award of a firm fixed-price contract, with a base year and four one-year options. <br />

Supplies (Feb 2009) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause-- ?Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item?? (1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is? (i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition at FAR 2.101); (ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and (iii) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and (2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in section 3 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. App. 1702), such as agricultural products and petroleum products. ?Component? means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into an end product. ?Cost of components? means-- (1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or (2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the end product. ?Domestic end product? means? (1) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in the United States; (2) An end product manufactured in the United States, if? (i) The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind as those that the agency determines are not mined, produced, or manufactured in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are treated as domestic. Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic; or (ii) The end product is a COTS item. ?End product? means those articles, materials, and supplies to be acquired under the contract for public use. ?Foreign end product? means an end product other than a domestic end product. ?United States? means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas. (b) The Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a-10d) provides a preference for domestic end products for supplies acquired for use in the United States. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, the component test of the Buy American Act is waived for an end product that is a COTS item (See 12.505(a)(1)). (c) Offerors may obtain from the Contracting Officer a list of foreign articles that the Contracting Officer will treat as domestic for this contract. (d) The Contractor shall deliver only domestic end products except to the extent that it specified delivery of foreign end products in the provision of the solicitation entitled ?Buy American Act Certificate.? (End of clause) <BR> <BR>GUARANTEE (JAN 2008) The contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of [ ]\1\, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor.\2\ (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>INSPECTION (JAN 2008) Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor?s address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor?s account. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>ELECTRONIC INVOICE SUBMISSION (Interim - OCT 2008) (a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system. At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process. At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service. During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA?s Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>Alternate I (Mar 2012). As prescribed in 25.1101(b)(1)(ii), add the following definition to paragraph (a) of the basic clause, and substitute the following paragraph (c) for paragraph (c) of the basic clause:
?Canadian end product? means an article that--
(1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of Canada; or
(2) In the case of an article that consists in whole or in part of materials from another country, has been substantially transformed in Canada into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was transformed. The term refers to a product offered for purchase under a supply contract, but for purposes of calculating the value of the end product includes services (except transportation services) incidental to the article, provided that the value of those incidental services does not exceed that of the article itself.
(c) Delivery of end products. 41 U.S.C. chapter 83 provides a preference for domestic end products for supplies acquired for use in the United States. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, the component test of the Buy American Act is waived for an end product that is a COTS item (see 12.505(a)(1)). In addition, the Contracting Officer has determined that NAFTA applies to this acquisition. Unless otherwise specified, NAFTA applies to all items in the Schedule. The Contractor shall deliver under this contract only domestic end products except to the extent that, in its offer, it specified delivery of foreign end products in the provision entitled ``Buy American Act-- Free Trade Agreements--Israeli Trade Act Certificate.'' If the Contractor specified in its offer that the Contractor would supply a Canadian end product, then the Contractor shall supply a Canadian end product or, at the Contractor's option, a domestic end product. <BR> <BR>The contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of [ ]\1\, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor.\2\
(End of Clause) <BR> <BR>ELECTRONIC INVOICE SUBMISSION (Interim - OCT 2008)
(a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system. At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process. At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 07 - 619 - Montgomery, AL is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. <br>  <br> 	HQ Army Materiel Command	 <br> 	Office of Command Counsel <br> 	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 <br> 	Ft.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to provide USAID/Burma with a set of interventions to promote and protect the rule of just law and civil liberties in Burma. The contract will address key capacity and structural gaps that limit the effectiveness of selected justice system actors and inhibit inclusive participation in rule of law reform initiatives. This project supports the overall policy goal of the U.S. Government's strategic foreign assistance priorities in Burma of "A prosperous, democratic, and stable Burma that reflects the diversity and aspirations of its people, is responsibly integrated into the international system, and plays a productive role in advancing regional economic growth and security." It specifically supports the Mission's Political and Security Reform Goal of: "Transparent, accountable, responsive, and participatory processes and institutions."
<p>The program has two complementary objectives: 1) to promote more effective, accountable and accessible justice sector institutions; and 2) to increase legal literacy, access to justice and participation of marginalized populations in target regions/states. The approach to be taken in implementing this project is to 1) work strategically across key areas in the justice sector, balancing supply of and demand for fair and equitable justice services; 2) immediately provide assistance to identified needs and deepen engagement with justice stakeholders; and 3) build local capacity to identify and address needs that will contribute to the achievement of project goals.<br /><br />In consideration of the complexity of the tasks of the activity and due to uncertainties in contract performance and the demand driven nature of the activity, costs cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract, therefore a cost reimbursable plus fixed fee contract is more appropriate (FAR 16.301-2). This is a task order issued under USAID's International Rule of Law (ROL) IQC and each Contractor was given a fair opportunity to be considered.</p>
