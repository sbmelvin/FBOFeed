<DESC>ELSG/PNK formally announces the intent to award a sole source task order FA8734-08-D-0006 to Government Retirement and Benefits, Inc. (GRB) for approximately $5.2M; basic 3 month performance period and four-1 year options. To meet mission requirements, the objective of this acquisition is to provide each of the current Consortium agencies the license/subscription to use the EBIS II web based product. Current membership include; US Air Force, US Army, US Navy, DLA, WHS, EoP, DODEA, DFAS, DISA, and DCAA.  This acquisition is to deploy leading edge technical solutions to improve human resource functionality and efficiency.The integrated Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) - Employee Benefits Information System (EBIS) data software subscription is used in support of the IVRS-EBIS Consortium.  Support requires the continuation (renewal) of the current EBIS II license and maintenance support.
Justifications for this follow-on contract is FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  These services are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of an anticipated follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly proprietary services.  The period of time required to perform a source selection for a new contractor would cause an unacceptable schedule delay in fulfilling the agency's requirements for support of license and maintenance support and a substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition due to no other contractors having access or rights to the proprietary data necessary to support this requirement.
The basic period of performance is approximately 3 months and 4 one year options.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested persons that identify to the contracting officer their intent and capabilities to satisfy the government's requirement with commercial services items and are received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service or the manufacturer meets qualifications requirements at the time of award, in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1 or 52.209-2.  An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facili! tate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  Before consulting the ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9010, OMBUDSMAN, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract.

<CONTACT>Isabelle A. Nguyen, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-344-1129, Fax 202-344-1812, Email isabelle.nguyen@dhs.gov
<DESC>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) intends to award a sole source procurement to Applied Biosystems of 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, CA  94404.  The purpose of this acquisition is to procure the Applied Biosystems 4000QTrap, a Liquid Chromatograph with a hybrid high performance triple quadruple/linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) system from Applied Biosystems. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees. Customs and Border Protection Laboratories and Scientific Services Houston Laboratory has a need for a Liquid Chromatograph with a hybrid high performance triple quadruple/linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) system that is capable of analyzing chloramphenicol in seafood using Florida Department of Agriculture, SOP No. Method 401 a levels of C.3 ppb and FDA method for Nitrofuran Metabolites at 1 ppb and confirming results with a second detector (the linear ion trap). The Applied Biosystems 4000QTrap is a high performance bench top hybrid triple quadruple linear ion trap LC/MS/MS system. The instrument combines separation power of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with detection power of both triple quadruple and linear ion trap mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometers allow for specificity of the analysis of known organic compounds and the flexibility needed for unknown organic compounds. The instrument is equipped with multiple ESI (electrospray ionization) and APCI (atmospheric pressure chemical ionization) sources to enable the widest possible scope of types of organic samples can be analyzed. The system has two types of detector systems or mass spectrometers, linear ion trap and triple quadruple. This allows for multiple MS/MS analyses. Samples include detection, identification and quantization of antibiotics in agricultural and food products (adulteration), determination of country of origin; the detection, identification and quantization of pharmaceutical drugs in foreign manufactured pharmaceutical products; the detection, identification and quantization of pharmaceutical and controlled substances in herbal and non-traditional medicine commodities; analysis of pesticides in food and agricultural products; identification of unknown organic compounds. Applied Biosystems is uniquely qualified to provide this instrument, as they are the sole vendor for the Applied Biosystems 4000QTrap. Applied Biosystems 4000QTrap was purchased by CBPs Savannah and New York laboratories. Having the same system will facilitate training, method development, and sample throughout CBP. The Savannah and New York laboratories have developed analytical techniques using an Applied Biosystems LC/MS/MS that will make easier the technology transfer to other laboratories if LSS can standardize on the same instrument.  In addition, because of the very complex and sophisticated nature of these analyses, the purchase of an identical instrument will aid in obtaining reproducible results from the multiple laboratories. In accordance with FAR 6.301 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements, CBP has determined Applied Biosystems to be the only firm capable of satisfying the requirements stated above. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Notwithstanding, any interested firm that believes it is capable of meeting the requirement stated herein may submit written qualifications, which if received by 3PM EST, Friday, August 22, 2008, will be considered.  Interested firms shall provide detailed information outlining their capabilities  any response failing to provide the aforementioned data will be disregarded. Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Isabelle Nguyen at isabelle.nguyen@dhs.gov.  Verifications of receipt of responses are the sole responsibility of the contractor.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORKPerform Repair on Carrier Chiller Unit.6/24/2008
1.  GENERAL: Kooskia National Fish Hatchery Employs a Carrier 160 ton 2 stage air cooled screw compressor chiller system.  The chiller has two separate compressors 'A' and 'B'.  This system is used to chill reuse system makeup water through the summer months and to chill well water for egg incubation through the fall and winter months.  Annual Maintenance on the chiller is required to maintain system warranty, and insure reliable system operation.  All regular and recurring maintenance on the main Carrier chiller unit at Kooskia National fish Hatchery was contracted and performed April 23, 2007.  No mechanical problems were detected at that time.  The B compressor developed unforeseen mechanical problems the week of July 9th, 2007.  Work was contracted to replace the 'B' compressor.  After the contract was awarded the 'A' compressor failed - approximately October 15, 2007.  Work on the 'B' compressor was completed and Carrier engineers were present for startup.  The chiller unit has a history of failed compressors.  After the engineers examined the failed compressor and the chiller operations, it was determined that an oil injection system was needed for this particular chiller application to prevent future main compressor bearing failures.  The chiller is critical to hatchery operations throughout the summer fish rearing and fall egg incubation periods.

2.  DEFINITIONS:  
3.  SCOPE:  Replace 'A' compressor.  Install new oil injection line kits on 'A' and 'B' compressors,  Provide Liquid line drier cores, external and internal oil filters for new compressor.

<SUBJECT>Analysis of Telomere samples
<SOLNBR>NCI-80194-NG
<RESPDATE>082908
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov - Malinda L Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), a division of The National Institutes of Health (NIH) plans to procure on a sole source basis analysis of telomere samples with Dr. Immaculata DeVivo Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School, 181 Longwood Avenue Boston, MA 02115.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification code is 622110 and the business size standard is 31.5M employees.

Period of Performance: One year from date of award.

The primary objective of this procurement is to determine telomere length in a nested case-control study of gastric cancer cases and controls.  Although a large number of studies have evaluated the role of telomere length in tumor biology and the aging process, a smaller number of studies have investigated the role it may play as a risk factor for cancer.  Limited data are available on the impact of telomere length and telomerase activity in the gastric mucosa.  Experimental studies have observed increased telomerase activity and decreased telomere length in gastric tumor tissue compared to normal gastric tissue.  The pathway from exposure to shortened telomere length and subsequent elevated cancer risk has not been well examined, particularly for gastric cancer for which no evaluation of germline telomere length has been conducted to date. In this study, the contractor will propose to measure germline telomere length by Q-PCR of genomic DNA in gastric cancer cases and controls from a pooled nested case-control study.  Cases and controls will be drawn from four prospective studies: the Shanghai Womens Health Study (SWHS), the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC), the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO), and the Womens Health Initiative (WHI).  The purpose of this study is to investigate whether telomere length is associated with gastric cancer risk and to relate measures of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress with telomere length.  Existing and study generated data on H. pylori status and virulence, gastric atrophy, markers of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress from prospectively collected specimens will be used.  Knowledge gained from this study will provide important information on characterizing telomere length and its relation to gastric cancer.  In order to allow direct comparison of data from all studies, it is necessary for telomere length Q-PCR measurement to be performed in the same laboratory as the previous study of this procurement. (Reference Contract # MQ703153)
The purpose of the current procurement is to determine telomere length by high-throughput Q-PCR in 450 gastric cancer cases, 900 controls, and an additional 150 blinded quality control samples.

Contractor Requirements:

The contractor shall perform the following tasks:
1.	Analyze average telomere length in 1500 samples in triplicate using a Q- PCR assay (e.g. total 4500 analyses).
2.	Provide a plan for determining if the replicate values are in agreement and for repeat duplicates, as needed (allow 5% sample replenishment).
3.	The dates of service will extend from August 18, 2008 through August 17, 2009.

The proposed contractor, Brigham and Womens Hospital of Harvard Medical School, has an operating telomere assay that is capable of measuring average telomere length in DNA using limited amounts of DNA and with high-throughput to analyze the needed number of samples. The other techniques available (Southern blot, FISH) require large amounts of DNA that are not available within these studies and lack high-throughput capabilities rendering these techniques unsuitable for the proposed studies. The requested scope of the work can only be reasonably achieved with this novel high-throughput assay, as alternative low-throughput methods like Southern blots would take a fulltime analyst several years to complete.  Therefore, due to the urgency of the research and the lengthy time requirement, it has been determined Brigham and Womens Hospital laboratory is the only known source to the NCI which can meet all of the Governments requirements.

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11 a.m. ET August 29, 2008.  Faxed and E-mailed capability statements are not authorized.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at Holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive and award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Please reference solicitation number NCI-80194-NG on all correspondence.

<SUBJECT>Global methylation in bladder tumor and genomic DNA samples
<SOLNBR>NCI-80195-MM
<RESPDATE>082908
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov - Malinda L Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis, global methylation in 85 bladder tumor and genomic  DNA samples with Transgenomic Discovery; April Hall Transgenomic Inc.; 12325 Emmet Street; Omaha, NE 68164. 

 The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 the business size standard is 6.5M employees.

The period of performance for this procurement shall be twelve months from date of award.

This procurement is for the analysis of the global methylation of specifically selected CpG sites from 85 DNA samples (2 biological sources of DNA; 200,000 cases with genomic DNA from blood, 35 cases' with tumor tissue extracted from FFPE bladder tumor tissue. After identification of altered CpG site methylation, results will be verified using high-throughput technologies to confirm the alterations identified using surveyor profiling and sequencing methodologies that are only available at Transgenomic Inc. 

The most common test for H. pylori infection used in epidemiologic studies is the ELISA method measuring antibody titers to whole cell and cagA strains in serum or plasma.  Recently, an immunoblot method has been developed which is more sensitive in detecting cagA strains.  The ELISA assay is also used for measuring levels of pepsinogen I and II in serum or plasma.

Growing evidence supporting the findings that global hypomethylation may be a potential biomarker for bladder cancer risk. Current work utilizes genomic DNA isolated from blood, buccal cells, or urine to quantitate methylation changes. Although the existing literature suggests an inverse association between global methylation and increased risk for cancer (including lung, colon, and bladder), it has yet to be demonstrated in a population based study that genomic DNA isolated from any ofthese biological specimens represents methylation changes occurring in tumor tissue and phenotypically, among non-target tissue extracted from different types oftissues/cells. NCI currently wants to address this question in the New England Bladder Cancer Study, which has matched genomic' and tumor DNA extracted for 50 participants (35 cases with matching tumor DNA available for analysis).

The contractor shall perform the following tasks.

1.	Conduct global methylation analysis using CpG chip microarrays designed to analyze over 200,000 CpG sites within the genome using DNA samples from bladder cancer case tumor and blood cell DNA among enrolled in the NESEH case-control study. 

2.	Confirm positive findings using surveyor endonuclease and sequencing  methodologies. 

3.	Custom design a human CpG island micro array chip containing 244k 60 mer oligo probes. Each micro array shall contain approximately 200k CpG probes and 50 non-CpG probes. The probes shall be selected based on the enriched content sources from UCSChg18 and NCBI build 36. I database. DNA shall be labeled, hybridized, according to standard methodologies

4.	Methylation of individual CpG sites shall be examined by double stranded sequencing of PCR products from bisulfate-treated DNA.

Transgenomic is currently the only company that provides a specific method of high-throughput, and sensitive sequencing services that employ Surveyor endonuclease, an optimized derivative of Cel I endonuclease and the patented WAVE system to separate fragments based upon size. This procurement proposes to use the same methodologies in addition to newer microarray chip based technology to identify epigenetic alterations associated with risk factors and disease progression. It is critical for comparability to ongoing studies that Transgenomic completes the analysis. There is currently no other known source to the NCI that is able to complete the work outlined in this procurement. 

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. ET on August 29, 2008. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Melissa Marino: marinome@mail.nih.gov. It is the vendors responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid, updated registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Please reference NCI-80195-MM on all correspondence.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541910   NAICS Code:  541910.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) located in Washington, D.C. intends to award a purchase order to A.C. Nielsen of Schaumburg, IL, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  BACKGROUND:  Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), EPA must determine whether pesticides accomplish their intended function without posing an unreasonable risk to the environment.  FIFRA provides Agency authority to issue regulations to exempt pesticides from FIFRA requirements, such as the requirement to obtain a license for a pesticide product before it may be sold or distributed.  EPA issued a regulation in 1996 that deregulated certain pesticides.  New information has become available that indicates that this exemption should be revised.  Specifically, the Agency is gathering information to assess the extent of public benefit that could result if EPA decides to re-regulate personal insect repellent products that are exempt under the 1996 regulation.  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this purchase order is to obtain retail sales data for personal insect repellents, including exempt insect repellent products.  This data will then enable EPA to assess the cost to industry if the exemption were rescinded for insect repellent products and the benefits that may accrue from such regulation.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Deliverables are to be submitted within 30 days of purchase order award.  This will be a one-time purchase with 12 months of after-service (answering questions about data, etc.) from the vendor.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA?s requirements, as stated herein, may submit their corporate capabilities, which if received by the response date of this announcement may be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to Rebecca Hindin, Contract Specialist at hindin.rebecca@epa.gov by 11 AM ET on Monday, August 25, 2008.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Rebecca Hindin, Contract Specialist via e-mail at hindin.rebecca@epa.gov .

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION: a.  General: This acquisition is being procured in accordance with PL-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and implemented in FAR Part 36.6.  Firms having substantially created any of the underlying documents related to this solicitation shall be precluded from submitting a statement of qualifications.  Services are required for facilitation, coordination, scheduling, administration, and staffing workshops for civil, military, and environmental programs and projects at various locations within the aligned boundaries of the SWF customers. North American Industrial Classification System(NAICS)Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711.  This announcement is Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA).  This acquisition is subject to the Vietnam Era Veteran's Readjustment Assistance Act of 1972 and the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998.  Any contractor awarded a contract under this solicitation will be required to submit a current VETS 100 Report. EVALUATION PREFERENCE USING CASCADING APPROACH.  The Government plans to use the cascading approach on this requirement.  The requirement is offered to all qualified concerns and proposals will be considered using a cascading order of preference.  Each tier will be evaluated using the procedures outlined below.  A determination that no firms are highly qualified will be made before the next tier is evaluated.  First Tier.  It is the intent of the Government to award a contract to an eligible small business firm provided that five highly qualified firms submit SF 330's and award can be made at a fair market price.  Last Tier.  If circumstances do not permit award to any small business firms, the Government intends to award to large business concerns provided that five highly qualified firms submit a SF 330 and award can be made at a fair and reasonable price.   The contracts will be firm-fixed price.  Two IDIQ contracts will be awarded from this announcement for a cumulative amount of $3,000,000 with a Minimum Guarantee amount of $5,000 for a term not to exceed five years for each contract.  The contracts are anticipated to be awarded on or about April 2009.  Projects to be contracted are not yet determined and funds are not presently available.  The firms selected must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently.  If a large business firm is selected from this announcement, it must comply with the FAR 52.219-9 clause regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  The subcontracting goals for the Fort Worth District which will be considered in the negotiation of this acquisition are:  (1) at least 70% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB); (2) at least 6.2% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB); (3) at least 7% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with women-owned SB (WOSB); (4) at least 3% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Veteran-Owned VOSB; (5) at least 9.8% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with HUB Zone SB and at least 0.9% to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  Written justification must be provided if the minimum small business goals cannot be met.  The Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be evaluated in accordance with AFARS 19.7, Appendix DD.  The plan is not required as part of this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal if any large business firms are selected for negotiations.  Before a small disadvantaged business is proposed as a potential subcontractor, they must be certified by the U.S. Small Business Administration and registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  NO STATE LEVEL certifications will be accepted.  Failure of a proposed small disadvantaged business to be certified by the U.S. Small Business Administration at the time the SF 330 is submitted will result in their elimination as a proposed subcontractor.   The Service Contract Act will apply to this acquisition.  The proposed services  may include a time and materials line for construction phase services.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the CCR.  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.  2.  PROJECT INFORMATION: No specific projects are identified at this time.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   HubZone Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Administrative Facilities in the Southwest Region (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX )<BR><BR>The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Kathy Snell, 817-886-11 63; or by e-mail to Kathy.Snell@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignm ent (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition a nd construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identifi ed for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition (WIT) barracks and a ll related Administrative Buildings and Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses. The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   T he IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT,  WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Administrative Facilities - The scope consists of but is not limited to the following administrative facilities as separate or combined tasks:<BR><BR>The Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ) facility is comprised of administration, special functions, storage and classroom components for personnel assigned to work in those facilities.  T he BN HQ is where visitors can be received and entry into the complex controlled and has a clear and convenient pedestrian access to the Barracks/Company Operations Facility (BCOFs) and Dining Facility (DFAC).  BN HQ facilities shall comply with the Americ ans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) for Buildings and Facilities.  BN HQs will have private offices.  The BN HQ facility will provide a staff duty station at the building entrance/reception area.  Every HQ BN will provide a Sec ure Communications Room with a Secret Internet Protocol Router network (SIPRNET) connectivity in accordance with latest criteria.<BR><BR>The administrative building function is to provide soldier mission direction and operational needs requirements.  This facility will operate in a similar manner as the Battalion and Brigade headquarters facilities and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to an office building.<BR><BR>Lawn Equipment Storage Buildings (LEB) will provide adequate storag e for maintenance equipment and materials used in the grounds-keeping and care of the BT site.  The LEBs will prevent unauthorized access and protect maintenan ce equipment from outdoor elements, including rain and snow.  <BR><BR>Both the AIT and BT related construction includes Outside Areas, including a jogging track, physical training (PT) pits, vehicular and service access drives and parking areas.  Exterior lighting shall be provided for parking areas, side walks, interconnecting buildings, service yards, service drives, outdoor training areas, and any required security lighting.  Parking shall be provided for BN HQ staff, Company Cadre within BCOF, DFAC staf f, government and service vehicles and visitors.  PT Pits will be located in close proximity of the BCOF it serves.<BR><BR>The Soldier Family Assistance Center (SFAC) serves as a transitional facility, which bridges the gap between in the transition betwee n family assistance and assisting the soldier in personal adjustments.  Soldier assistance by family members is critical element in the recovery from injuries.  Child care areas, financial assistance, meeting rooms, kitchenette, chaplain and other assistan ce type functions to accommodate both the soldier and their families are provided in this facility.   <BR><BR>It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, wh ich may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.<BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Tw o Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build constru ction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 6 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of t he process.  <BR><BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accor dance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror(s), whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall  best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award. In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR><BR>The following technical evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation:  Phase 1  Specialized Experience; Past Perfor mance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Phase 2  Volume I:  Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; and Sustainability Requirements.  Volume II:   Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.  <BR><BR>Solicitation W9126G-08-R-0163 is estimated to issue on or about 1 April 2008.    Phase 1 proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 30 April 2008 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 154 2.  The Small Business Size Standard is $31 Million.    <BR><BR>The Government intends to award up to 3 contracts as a result of this solicitation.  In the even t that one or more of the contracts proposed for award cannot be made, the Government may award contracts with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.   If only one of the proposed contracts under this  MATOC can be made, the Government reserves the right to award a SATOC with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a c-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude.  The remaining capacity would then be advertised as a full and open competition.  Each  contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is T erminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance.  The  Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.   Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.  Once the cont racts under this solicitation are awarded and there is duplicative coverage for this facility type in the same region, any requirement less than $15 million will be evaluated first for advertisement under any set-aside contract or pool of contracts prior.  The Government will consider the current workload under the set-aside contract, performance on previous task orders, and the small business firms ability to obtain additional boding prior to making a determination.  <BR><BR>The total estimated contract c apacity is $28,000,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government res erves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  The minimum guarantee will be $ 5,000.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Fun ds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.   The minimum task order limitation is $10,000.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $6,000,000.  The maximum combination of orders is $12,000,000.  The G overnment reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price.  <BR><BR>The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE.WITHIN THE NAICS CODE 334220 - THIS RFI IS FOCUSED ON SPACE SATELLITES, COMMUNICATIONS,MANUFACTURING.A. Request Summary The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans to establish sciencestations on the lunar surface beginning in 2013-2014, followed by human return to theMoon and establishment of the first lunar outpost beginning in 2020.  Communications,networking, and navigation capabilities required to support these efforts could beprovided by the U.S. Government (USG), other international space agencies participatingin the Science and Exploration initiatives, or by private companies.  NASA is seekinginformation regarding the extent of interest in commercially provided Communications,Networking, and/or Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) (abbreviated as Communicationsand Navigation or C&N) capabilities or services supporting the development and growth ofexploration, scientific, commercial, and other capabilities on the Moon over the next 25years, consistent with international law.  In accordance with 15.201 (e), the information requested is for planning purposes onlyand is not intended to bind the USG. B. Background NASAs Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has proposed the creation of an InternationalLunar Network (ILN) beginning as early as 2013-2014.  The objective of the ILN is toestablish a science network of surface stations.  The data returned from these ILNsurface stations will enable construction of detailed three-dimensional computer modelsof the internal composition and dynamics of the Moon.  Each station will simultaneouslyoperate a group of geophysical measurement instruments (e.g., seismometers and heat flowsensors).  Stations will be placed at diverse locations on the Moon for periods of six toeight years.  The space agencies of other countries have been invited to become partnersin the ILN and their participation is being studied concurrently with this Request forStudy Information (RFI).  The diversity of surface sites may include far side locationsor power-constrained communications subsystems that will drive the need for lunarorbiting data relay and tracking capabilities.	Interoperability of communications anddata transmissions between the participants lunar stations and their ground systems is agoal to enable flexibility in defining partner contributions, to open the exchange andintegration of information, and to enhance the probability of mission success.NASAs Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) is developing the launch vehicles,space transportation, and selected lunar surface systems supporting Human Lunar Return(HLR) by 2020 in accordance with the U.S. Space Exploration Policy and the NASAAuthorization Act of 2005 [PL 109-55].	NASA has determined that the ExplorationArchitecture should establish an outpost at a polar location that can support longduration missions while also possessing the capability to perform short duration sortiemissions that can reach anywhere on the surface.  NASA empowered by both PL 109-55 andthe U.S. Space Exploration Policy, is interested in both commercial and internationalparticipation in exploration.  As part of its plan in pursuit of these goals, NASA seekswith this RFI to learn the level of commercial interest in lunar C&N.  A paper describingthe results of the 2007 Lunar Architecture Team (LAT) Phase 2 C&N study can be downloadedfrom the public Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) web site at: https://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/programs/system_planning/default.cfm  NASA'sLunar Space Communication and Navigation Architecture (LAT2 2007) (June 2008, PDF, 2.8MB) The Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Office within the Space Operations MissionDirectorate manages and directs the ground and space-based facilities and user servicesprovided to Science and Exploration missions by the existing Near Earth Network, DeepSpace Network, and geosynchronous Space Network, and is responsible for establishing thefuture space communications Lunar Network (LN). [Note that the SCaN Lunar Network and SMDInternational Lunar Network are completely different].	The scope of the lunar network(LN) is still being developed but may include: lunar orbiting C&N satellites, groundstations to control the network, and lunar surface wired and wireless C&N systems.  Thecombination of lunar Science through the ILN Program and lunar Exploration through theConstellation Program offers an evolutionary growth path for C&N capabilities over thenext two decades.  To meet the anticipated needs of NASAs lunar science and explorationmissions, the SCaN Office will examine the potential for commercial opportunities forlunar C&N capabilities and services. C. Description of Anticipated Capabilities and/or ServicesThe SCaN Office anticipated capabilities in support of the NASA lunar exploration programinclude:(1)	The capability to provide initial lunar C&N services to support SMDs ILNProgram.  Depending on the definition of ILN requirements, this capability may be neededas early as 2013.(2)	The capability to provide essential C&N to support ESMDs human exploration ofthe Moon.   Depending on the definition of Exploration requirements, this capability maybe required as early as 2018.  To determine the magnitude of the commercial opportunity,the extent of commercial communications and navigation capabilities available to augmentNASA services and capabilities must be determined.  This has also been referred to asbasic or initial C&N and is intended to address the capability that will be providedby NASA rather than an external partner.  NASA invites industry comment on definingessential C&N. The lunar C&N capabilities will be provided by NASA, other national space agency oragencies, private industry, or some combination of these options.  NASAs goals in allscenarios are to maximize interoperability between participants C&N capabilities and toprovide a well defined evolutionary path that maximizes continued support for futureScience and Exploration missions.D. Information Requested Through this Request For Study Information, the Government desires to improve itsunderstanding of private industrys ability and interest to provide the anticipatedcapabilities and/or services.  This Request For Study Information is one step of a largerstudy plan during 2008, that will culminate in a final NASA report that will addressaspects of commercial codevelopment of lunar C&N.  No Request For Proposals (RFP) isanticipated to directly follow this RFI; however, NASA reserves the right to issue an RFPin the future if the study concludes that commercial lunar C&N capabilities are likely tobenefit NASA.  It is emphasized that this Request For Study Information is for planningand information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by theGovernment to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay forinformation solicited.	This RFI is open to international submissions.No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If asolicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service. This study plan can be downloaded from the public SCaN web site at:https://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/programs/system_planning/default.cfm  CommercialLunar Communication and Navigate Study Plan for RFI (August 2008, PDF, 2 MB)Respondents are requested to provide information that addresses all or any subset of thefollowing topics:1.  What communications, networking, and/or navigation services or capabilities would yoube interested in providing to NASA or should otherwise be available on a commercial basisover the next 20 years to meet the initial and/or expanded lunar C&N needs?  2.  What is your organizations perspective on the commercial lunar C&N market over thenext 20 years?3.  Keeping in mind NASAs requirement to address human safety and mission assurance, howshould essential C&N be defined to maximize commercial opportunity?  4.  What type(s) of investment and/or procurement approaches or mechanisms would yourecommend be used?5.  What international collaboration might you pursue or otherwise recommend to meet NASAand international needs for lunar C&N capabilities and services?6.  In light of existing treaty obligations and legislation, what perceived barriers tocommercial activity (e.g., legal (Reference Material: The Outer Space Treaty of 1967:http://history.nasa.gov/1967treaty.html    ), contractual, programmatic, organizational,or technical) may limit your ability to offer commercial C&N capabilities and services toNASA?  What approach(es) would you recommend to mitigate those barriers? 7.  What enablers of commercial activity would enhance your or others ability to offercommercial C&N capabilities and services to NASA?  What approach(es) would you recommendto foster these enablers?8.  What demonstrations do you envision to show capabilities and mitigate NASAs risks ofusing commercial C&N capabilities and services?9.  What other strategies or approaches do you recommend that NASA pursue that wouldcontribute to successful cooperation between NASA, industry and/or other entities tocreate commercial lunar capabilities?For purposes of this Request For Study Information, capabilities or services may includebut are not limited to:  terrestrial network services; terrestrial ground stations;Earth-orbiting capabilities; lunar orbiting capabilities; and lunar surface capabilities. Capabilities may be complete turnkey services; subsystems or components; partialsolutions such as applications for specific functions; or other capabilities believed tobe necessary to meet a portion of the anticipated needs. NASA does not require proprietary information; however, if the respondent submitsproprietary material it must be clearly marked with a protective legend and submitted ina file separate from nonproprietary information.

<a href="mailto:cheri.wicks@va.gov">Contracting Officer's email</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement for 4 Research Assistants at the Jamaica Plain campus.  A fixed price contract with a base of October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009 with two (2) options is anticipated and shall be awarded.  It is the Government's belief that only the Trustees of Boston University, School of Public Health, possess the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement.  It is the Government's intention to solicit and negotiate only with this source.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity: The agency is the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The activity is the Boston VA Medical Center.2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:The nature of the action is a sole source solicitation to Boston University School of Public Health.3.  The description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):The Center for Organization, Leadership and Management Research (COLMR), an HSR&D Center of Excellence at the VA Boston Healthcare System, requires the services of four Research Assistants.  These Research Assistants services will also be utilized to provide support to COLMR Investigators and Project Managers.The estimated total value of this service is $153,750.00.  4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source5.  Demonstration of the contractor's unique qualifications:Because of the high level of specialized research involved, these consultants will be hired under a sole source contract. COLMR requires a contractor with substantive knowledge of health services research, particularly within VA as well as the legal aspects of health care policy.  Boston University is the only University in the city teaching and conducting health services research and also includes a focus on the study of government in healthcare.  This school has also collaborated with VA on past research studies and understands the unique needs of the veteran population and the delivery of healthcare services to veterans.6.  Description of efforts made to ensure notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:This requirement is expected to exceed $25, 000 and in accordance with FAR 5.201(b)(1) a notice will be posted through FBO.7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable:The proposed price for individuals with this level of education, expertise, and related experience is fair and reasonable.  8.  Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:A review of three other University Schools in the Boston area found no source available that can provide the services expressed in section.  Harvard University and Boston College have schools of Public Health but without a focus on health management services. Tufts University has no school of Public Health.  9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, or engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available:Requirements for research endeavors are very specific in nature and frequently there is only one responsible source. There is little the agency could do to open this requirement to competition.10.  A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:None to date.11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:This contracting activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.

<DESC>This serves as a Notice of Intent to purchase training services from Liferay, Inc .  This Notice is SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FY 2009 FUNDS pursuant to FAR Clause 52.232-18.  This notice does not obligate funds.  After careful consideration for incorporating portal technology into the next generation of GSA Advantage! FAS has chosen Liferay open source portal. The proposed technology is to support a framework of vertical services which are designed on a flexible architecture solution to implement, current and new requirements tailored to each store easily and fast with features like 
	personalization, 
	workflow, 
	search, 
	intra-agency information sharing, 
	collaboration and
	content management 
around a secured user role & group based identity management supporting the complete eCommerce experience efficiently and effectively.

With the above approach in mind and the requirement for rapid development of the PBS Store deployment FAS and Unisys have contacted Liferay for development training and for 200 hours of both onsite and offsite consulting support. FAS and Unisys have worked with Liferay to identify a custom training curriculum to focus on Liferay implementation in the GSA Advantage environment and the across the FAS Open Systems environment

Two hundred hours of consulting support has been requested broken out as follows:
	Two weeks (80 hours) of onsite support September 8th to 19th to fast track development of the PBS Store. The consultant would help to establish the environment, review the planned architecture and support initial development.
	Provide forty hours of off site support to answer developer questions from September 22nd to October 27th.
	Provide two weeks of on-site support for tuning, finishing touches to development, and production implementation.

Travel estimates for these engagements were provided separately and may be more or less once travel is actually booked. 

A rough estimate based on conversations with Liferay for Portal training, consulting, and travel is (please keep these numbers in confidence as we cannot quote on their behalf):

Training: $30,800
The government has evaluated several portal products and determined that Liferay Portal is the best fit for their environment. They have an aggressive delivery schedule and are looking to begin development as soon as possible. The timing of the training and consulting support is to complete rapid development of the PBS Vertical Store. 
A core component of Liferay's Professional Service offerings is its internal use of a knowledgebase of issues which is proprietary to Liferay Inc and provided directly by the core engineers who created the product. 
Liferay does not offer this service through any other channels.
The requirement is to provide the highest level of support available in a very quick turnaround. LifeRay, Inc is the only source for this type of support.

All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Beverly Bowden 703 605 2607, email:  beverly.bowden@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.  RE:  Note 22.

<DESC>There is no solicitation.  The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Contracting and General Services Division in Portland, OR has a requirement for the procurement of 1/4 ton rip rap (boulders) as well as other smaller quarry materials such as river run and roadbase type rock for levee (dike) repair at Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge.  Due to flood damage in 2007 approximately 2000 ft of dike needs to be repaired utilizing this rock.  This is a continuation of another dike repair project that was initiated in 2006.  The refuge needs to complete this work in order to prevent continued erosion of dikes that could allow flooding of infrastructure owned by federal, state, local and private entities.  Kernen Contruction is the only known company in Humboldt County that is supplying 1/4 ton rip rap.
The Service intends to award Sole Source to Kernen Contruction.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and is not a request for competitve proposals.

<DESC><p><br />National Oceanic and Atmospheric and Administrations Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the Catholic University of America, Office of Sponsored Programs, 620 Michigan Ave.,Washington, DC 20064.
<p>Background: NOAA/SEC physicists have been awarded a NASA LWS grant to develop new techniques for applying multi-view white-light observations of the solar corona to improve understanding and forecasting of Earthward-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs).</p>
<p>This sole source determination is based on NOAA/SEC requirement for instrumental calibrations, background corrections, and methodology needed to extract accurate polarization data for the NOAA/NASA/LWS Stereo White-Light Project. Additionally, image data, corrected images and analytic expertise from the STEREO project for SEC research are required as well as expertise on polarization issues. The project utilizes adaptations of two different techniques. One is the geometric localization technique developed at SEC, based on simple triangulation of points along the periphery of the CME as seen from the two views provided by the twin STEREO spacecraft. The other is the polarization analysis technique. Period of performance is 1 year with an option to extend for 1 more year. Reports are required for each performance period. The work is to be conducted at the recipient's home institution, making use of its equipment and resources.</p>
<p>The Catholic University of America is the only vendor that can meet the NOAA/SEC requirement for the instrumental calibrations, background corrections, and methodology needed to extract accurate polarization data for the project because the polarization technique was developed by Dr. Moran at The Catholic University, and Dr. Davila at NASA/GSFC. Additionally, Dr. Moran's expertise as a consultant for polarization issues is vital to combining successfully the results of polarization and geometric localization techniques in the new area of multi-view coronal analysis. Further, Dr. Moran, in collaboration with Dr. Davila, pioneered use of Polaroid imagery of CMEs using single-view SOHO/LASCO coronagraph data. In a landmark paper in Science (305, 66, 2004), they demonstrated for the first time that meticulously corrected polarization data could be used to obtain an impression of the three-dimensional structure of CMEs, a feat long hoped for by coronal physicists but never actually achieved. Dr. Moran's work on the instrumental corrections was a key element in unlocking the power of polarization information for this application. In addition, his close collaboration with Dr. Davila, project scientist for the STEREO mission, his experience with handling real SOHO/LASCO data, and his familiarity with the STEREO instrumentation make him a unique fit to provide the corrected images and analytic expertise needed for the SEC project. The image data for the project will be provided by the NASA STEREO mission, which should begin producing binocular views of the corona in mid-summer of 2006.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but an announcement of a modification to an existing contract. No solicitation package is available. A determination by the Government, not to conduct a competitive procurement is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award modifications to its Facility Reduction Program (FRP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts which will increase the programmatic capacity consistent with the terms identified within this announcement. The FRP requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price and/or time and materials task orders which are placed against two (2) ID/IQ contracts in order to reduce the maximum amount of excess facility areas at Government installations through the removal of buildings and structures.  All current contract awards were made under full and open competition procedures.  The awards for the follow-on acquisitions are expected to be made in the 1st quarter of Fiscal Year 2010.  Due to the lapse in coverage, it is necessary that the current programmatic capacity be increased to eliminate delays and reduce any risk associated with the execution of mission essential facilities reduction requirements. Therefore, it is the Governments intention to modify the current FRP ID/IQ contracts to increase the programmatic capacity.<BR><BR>The programmatic capacity established at time of award of the current contracts was  $29,500,000 over a total possible five (5) year ordering period (one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods).  This capacity was determined  prior to the award of the contracts and was based on an analysis of the type of work required, anticipated workload, effects on competition, and the capability of small businesses to compete for the required work.  Additionally, no previous modifications have been executed to increase the programmatic capacity.  Based upon future anticipated requirements and taking into consideration current known requirements, it is necessary that the Government modify the current contracts to increase the capacity by $22,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to unilaterally modify the capacity of each contract award, within the Governments sound discretion, in order to adjust for changes in performance capabilities. Upon award of the follow-on acquisitions, new task orders will not be placed against the current contracts despite any remaining capacity.<BR><BR>The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows: W912DY-05-D-0010 (Bhate Environmental Associates, Inc.) and W912DY-05-D-0011 (Charter Environmental, Inc). The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain unchanged. <BR><BR>The Government intends to award the modifications to these contracts consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Due to the unique prior experience and involvement of the current contractors and the anticipated recurring need for facility reduction, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified.  The Government will support the proposed actions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.  The Government will synopsize the contract modifications after award. Written inquiries may be directed to Ms. Nadine Maack via email at myra.n.maack@usace.army.mil or Ms. Stefanie Forsyth via email at stefanie.j.forsyth@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the commercial item  identified below,   prepared in accordance with the format in Far Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation shall not be issued.  This solicitation number is: 3K45JW191  is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), and incorporates  provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.   This solicitation shall be solicited on a unrestricted basis.   The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) code is 334516.  The  U.S. Dept. of Agriculture intends to procure a quantity of one each of the following two instruments ( or equivalent ) in tandem, for use in a research environment:   Thermogravimetric Analyzer (manufactured by (TA Instruments ) , located in New Castle, Delaware and   (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer)- Model 6700  Manufactured by Thermo-Nicolet, located  in Madison , Wisconsin.  The following are the minimum requirements for the above two instruments: The  above listed  TGA and FT-IR instruments are required to work in tandem to provide simultaneous sample mass loss and spectral analysis of gases evolved during thermogravimetric analysis.  The FT-IR instrument shall be capable of utilizing a existing and U.S. Dept. of Agriculture owned Thermo Electron TGA/FT-IR Interface Model II for Nicolet FT-IR Spectrometers with a heated transfer line and this system shall recognize spectra and data files from existing Nicolet and TA Instruments TGA.   The TGA instrument should allow for a measurable temperature range of ambient to 1200 degrees celcious.   This TGA Instrument shall be used for kinetics analyses, a wide range of achievable heating rates is critical.  The TGA  instrument shall be able to control to heating rates  as low as 0.1 degrees celcious per minute, with noise levels over 10 degrees celcious no greater than ( plus or minus) 0.01 degrees celcious per minute (unsmoothed). The TGA shall also be able to control heating rates  asa fast as  500 degrees celcious per minute.  Examples of data files illustrating  this capability  shall be supplied and shall be used for verification.  Balance Sensitivity:  The TGA Balance shall have a sensitivity of at least 0.1 microgram.  Examples  of data files illustrating this capability shall be supplied  and shall be used for verification.  The TGA baseline should exhibit less than 10 microgram of drift over the temperature range ambient greater than 1000 degrees celcious (uncorrected) in either air or N2 atmosphere.   The TGA isothermal baseline  shall drift no more than 5 microgram over 18 hours.   The TGA shall include digital mass flow controllers for at least two separate purge gasses, such that the purge gas can be automatically switched via software during the experiment.  The flow rate shall also be adjustable via software during an experiment.  
The flow rates shall be data logged  into the resulting date file.   Because this inTGA instrument shall be used extensively, and often on a 24 hour basis, it shall come equipped  with a robotic autosampler containing  at least 20 sample positions.  The autosampler shall also include a pn punching mechanism, by which samples can be kept sealed in a hermetic environment, and punched open just prior to loading.  This pan punching shall produce a large breach in the pan, rather than a pin-hole, as our materials  rely  on efficient sample/gas interaction.  The TGA instrument shall include some form of automatic variable rate control to improve resolution.  The heating rate shall be continuosly adjusted as a function of sample mass loss rate, as opposed to a stepwise isothermal approach.  The TGA instrument shall allow for automatic, unattended calibration  of both temperature (curie-point standards) and mass.  These calibrations shall be programmable and schedulable from within the operating software, as this TGA shall be used by numerous researchers, it is critical that the analysis software shall be installed on multiple computers.  The analysis program shall be un-keyed, and shall include a site-license such that it may be installed on a unlimited number of  computers within the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Also, this acquisition is being conducted under FAR 13.5, Test Program Procedures for commercial items.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is N62645-08-R-0020  The solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24 are incorporated.  It is the contractors responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.  The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.acqnet.gov/far and www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dfars/index.htm.  The NAICS code is 541990, with a small business size of $7 million.  This is a 100% small business set-aside; all qualified vendors are encouraged to submit a proposal.

The Naval Medical Logistics Command requests responses from qualified small business sources capable of providing animal study on NIDBR Drug Formulation with the following Statement of Work:

Background - The Naval Institute for Dental and Biomedical Research (NIDBR) requires contract services for testing of drug and placebo formulations in BALB/c mice with experimental cutaneous Leishmania major infections.
To date, NIDBR has conducted in vitro experiments on Leishmania major promastigotes and host  cells.  For parasite cultures, we have generated data to illustrate a dose dependent toxic effect of the active drug on Leishmania major. The LD50 for this drug was estimated to be 0.06 ug/ml and 0.03 ug/ml for administration of one and two doses, respectively.  To ensure that the active drug is not toxic to host cells, human skin flbroblasts have been used as controls. In these experiments, administration of 62 ug/ml did not exert a cytotoxic effect to host cells over a 24-hour period.

1.Statement of Work.

1.1. Objective. Determine the efficacy of NIDBR's drug formulations for the
topical treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis in BALB/c mice. NIDBR's proprietary drug and placebo formulation will be applied topically onto the rump of mice, which have been infected with Lmajor. Efficacy of tine treatment will be assessed through a number of parameters, including: 1)
measurement of lesion; 2) physical signs; and 3) recovery time. During the course of the experiments the animals will be monitored for indicators of drug toxicity by documenting body weight, food and water consumption, and activity levels of infected adults.

1.2. Technical Tasks/Requirements.

As detailed in the addendum, the animal experiments would include:
1)inducing experimental cutaneous infections in BALB/c mice
2)applying topical application of NIDBR's drug or placebo formulation	
3)monitoring animals and recording data

The contractor will be required to communicate with NIDBR, on a monthly basis, to provide a summary of progress and to identify any difficulties or shortcomings. If problems arise, a teleconference or site visit (if necessary) will be held to promptly address and resolve the concern.

Animal research is to be conducted within a facility that is accredited by AAALAC. If the contractor handles large animals within their facility, then the USDA inspection requirements must be satisfied.

As a cooperative effort, NIDBR and Contractor will prepare applications and protocols that are required by all Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) authorities (i.e., Contractor's and Navy Surgeon General Oversight office (BUMED)). Experiments will not commence unless IACUC approval is obtained.

If needed, the Contractor will make accommodations to allow a site visit to the animal facility.

1.3. Deliverable: With the information detailed in the addendum, NIDBR expects to receive a report (hard and electronic copies) of all materials/methods employed and data resulting from this contract.
Blood collected at necropsy will be processed for plasma. Immediately thereafter, the plasma will be   aliquoted into 0.15 ml volumes and frozen ( -20C). Within a mutually agreed upon time, the frozen plasma aliquots will be shipped to NIDBR with an adequate amount of dry ice to maintain frozen samples.

If abnormal tissue is identified at necropsy, the tissue will be placed in a standard histology fixative and provided to NIDBR at a mutually agreed upon time.

1.4. Order Details

1.4.1 Period of Performance - The contract period is one year from date of
award of contract.

1.4.2   Place of Performance - Work will be performed at the Contractor's
facilities.

1.4.3  Government Furnished Resources (GFR) - Leishmania major cultures
and drug formulations will be provided by NIDBR within a mutually agreed
upon time. The parasites and drug formulations provided by NIDBR will only
be utilized for this contract. Excess of the parasite suspension will be
autoclaved (1 bar pressure, 121 C for 20 min) and discarded.

1.4.4   Facilities. Supplies and Services - All facilities, supplies (exception
stated in paragraph 1.4.3), and personnel required to perform the tasks outlined
in the Statement of Work will be the responsibility of the Contractor.

1.4.5   Information. All Government unique information related to this
requirement necessary for Contractor performance will be made available to
the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will be the
point of contact for identification of any required information to be supplied by
the Government.


1.4.6    Federal Ownership of Intellectual Property. Unless otherwise noted in
advance, all materials and data resulting from this effort are understood to be
the property of the Federal Government. To protect the Government's interest,
control and safety, prior written approval will be obtained for any changes or
replacement of the contractor's scientists who are involved in research under
the auspices of this contract.

1.4.7   Documentation: All existing documentation relevant to this task's
accomplishment will be made available to the Contractor.

2.Security Requirements

 2.1 Requirements. 
This is a non-classified project. Contractor is required to safeguard the information labeled as proprietary.

2.2.  Privacy Act. 
 All Contractor personnel assigned to this task will have access to information that may be subject to the         Privacy Act of 1974. The Contractor is required to ensure the proper safeguarding of such information to    prevent unauthorized release.

2.3.   Nondisclosure Agreement. 
In the course of its work, the selected Contractor may be required to execute a Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA). Each employee of the successful Offeror may be required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) prior to commencing work under this Order. The supervisor/manager of the proposed personnel may also be required to sign the NDA on behalf of the Contractor.

2.4.   Organizational Conflict of Interest. 
The parties acknowledge that, during performance of the contract resulting from this Order solicitation, the Contractor may require access to certain proprietary and confidential information (whether in its original or derived form) submitted to the Government Such information includes, but is not limited to, business practices, proposals, designs, mission or operation concepts, sketches, management policies, cost and operating expense, technical data and trade secrets. The Contractor shall take appropriate steps not only to safeguard such information, but also to prevent disclosure of such information to any party other than the Government. The Contractor agrees to indoctrinate company personnel who will have access to or custody of the information concerning the nature of the confidential terms under which NIDBR received such information and shall stress that the information shall not be disclosed to any other party or to Contractor personnel who do not need to know the contents thereof for the performance of the contract. Contractor personnel shall also be informed that they shall not engage in any other action, venture, or employment wherein this information will be used for any purpose by any other party.

3. Requirements

3.1  Inducing experimental cutaneous infections in BALB/c mice
As indicated (paragraph 3.3), NIDBR will provide the Leishmania major promastigotes. Prior to inoculating the animals, the contractor must confirm the viability of the parasites, using light microscopy (400X magnification). If > 95% of the parasites are motile, the experiment will be initiated by subcutaneously inoculating five-week-old female BALB/c mice in the shaved skin over the sacrum on the dorsal line at the base of the tail (referred to as the rump) with 5 X105 metacyclic Leishmania major promastigotes. If insufficient parasites are viable, then arrangements will be made for another shipment from NIDBR.

The animals will be housed individually for the duration of the experiment. As dictated by the approved animal use protocol, routine animal husbandry, euthanasia, and disposal of carcasses will be followed.

3.2  Applying topical application of NIDBR's drug or placebo formulation
Mice will be divided into three groups. For the first two groups, three different drug doses will be tested (see table). Each group of mice will be treated on 6 or 12 weeks post-infection (wpi), respectively. Within the designated treatment period, the animals will be treated twice a day for five consecutive days. Topical applications will be given by rubbing (small circular motions) the drug or placebo emulsion on the lesion for 1 minute. Efforts will be made to prevent grooming of the treatment site for 10 minutes after the application of the drug or placebo formulation by one of the following methods: 1) administration of a low dose of medetomidine (0.03 to 0.05 mg/kg SQ) for short-term sedation. (This can then be reversed by atipamezole (1 mg/kg IP or SQ)); 2) administration of isoflorane inhalant; or 3) use of plastic rodent restraint cylinder.

The duration of this experiment will be 14 weeks. Mice within group three will serve as normal controls or as infected untreated controls.

<p>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) * Are, * are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) * Have, * have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) * Are, * are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation (RFQ) of software support for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

PRICE: This is a proposed Firm Fixed Price contract type.

DELIVERY: Required within 7 days. 

The required item is as follows: SafeNet / Manufacturer; Security Management Center Software Maintenance & Support; Description: Security Management Center, Version 1.x , Advanced, controls up to 250 Gateways / SE-SMC-A-250-A, Part Number P/N 906-10001-004; with Maintenance Plan / PLUS Level (910-10002-001). New license not required, only maintenance and support. 3 each. The Period of Performance (POP) is October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009. 

BASIS FOR BRAND NAME REQUIREMENT:  The SafeNet encryption devices DFAS currently has in use are configured and manageable by the SafeNet Security Management Center software only.  Because of their proprietary nature, SMC software is the only software compatible with the devices, and procuring new software would require acquisition of a new encryption solution as well.  SafeNet is the only provider of the SMC software.  If the current maintenance agreement expires, warranties will be null and void leaving the agency at risk. The cost of new encryption hardware and software to accomplish the same purpose from other sources would be financially substantial to acquire, plus the additional cost of implementation.  As such, re-procuring licenses and implementing a new product would be costly and not in the best interests of the Government.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18. The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) assigned rating is DO-C9. The Government intends to include the following DFAS, FAR and DFARS clauses and provisions, either by reference or in full text in the resulting award.  NOTE: The FAR and DFARS clauses may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/
The offeror may contact the above Contract Specialist for a copy of the DFAS and DAS clauses if required.

The Department of State is a Microsoft volume license customer and currently has PCs that are covered by Software Assurance under a Microsoft Enterprise License Agreement (ELA).  As a volume license customer, the Department is eligible to acquire an optional subscription license for the MDOP for Software Assurance that is tied to the DoS desktop operating systems currently covered by Microsoft Software Assurance under the Departments Microsoft ELA and is purchased under the same enrollment number.  The term purchased would be for the remaining months through December 28, 2009 of the ELA of software assurance to be coterminous.  <BR><BR>The invoice shall be submitted via email to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), Tyrone Nunnely at NunnelyT@state.gov  One copy of the invoice shall be concurrently submitted via the Financial Operations FAX server at 866-483-3436 (each invoice shall be transmitted separately).

MDOP was selected through an SOE-DD Trade Study conducted by ENM in mid-2007 as the add-on that would meet the Departments requirements for an efficient and cost-effective way to automate the deployment of Microsoft Vista to the Departments OpenNet desktops.  The Department currently utilizes Microsoft operating systems and application software on 46,500 desktops and several thousand servers.  The study determined that the MDOP tool is uniquely suited to the Departments requirements for improved desktop lifecycle management.  The tool will contribute to efficiencies and cost avoidance by simplifying trouble shooting and root cause analysis of failed PC systems and servers; simplify application development and update release efforts by greatly reducing packaging and regression testing requirements; provide additional information and efficiencies to application and desktop support personnel already performing their duties with very limited tools; contribute to security compliance efforts in the DoS widely distributed environment; and offer significant return on investment.  Microsoft is the manufacturer of this product, and it can only be purchased through Microsoft resellers.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Solicitation number HSFEHQ-08-R-0087 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-26.

This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business under NACIS Code 238990 and 500 employees.  

A list of contract line item number(s), quantities and units of measure, (including option(s), are attached - see "Section B - Continuation Block."

The description of requirements for the items to be acquired are attached, entitled "Attachment B, Performance Work Statement."

Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  

Evaluation52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
 
(a) The Government will award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. The three (3) technical factors  Past Performance, Company Experience and Technical Approach when combined -- are more important than the Price/Cost (non-technical factor). Refer to FAR 15.101-2 -- Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process.   This is a competitive Small Business set-aside requirement.  This RFP is limited to proposing firms residing or doing business in the Counties of Baxter, Izard, Pope, Saline, Sharp Stone and Van Buren in the State of Arkansas.  This preference is invoked by Section 307 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 USC 5150), as amended by the President on 20 April 2006 (42 U.S.C. 5150) and implemented in FAR 26.200.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 238990.  
The technical proposal shall be limited to thirty (30) single-sided pages to include resumes. Any pages in excess of thirty (30) will not be evaluated.  Technical proposals must be submitted in the following format and must address each of the following elements:

Technical Evaluation Factors

FACTOR 1:	PAST PERFORMANCE	

The quality of the Offeror's past performance will be evaluated based on comparison of Past Performance Questionnaires with information the government obtains through reference checks, its own knowledge/experience, and/or from other source. The past performance evaluation will assess the Offeror's record of how well the Offeror did on work for government and private sector clients.  This evaluation will include assessments of the Offeror's resilience in the face of trouble, resourcefulness, and management determination to see that the organization lived up to commitments or standards. The government reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews to validate information provided in the past performance questionnaires and to obtain additional information from other internal and external sources, if known. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be given a favorable or unfavorable evaluation rating. The offeror will receive a neutral rating for the past performance factor. SEE ATTACHMENT A - PERFORMANCE QUESTIONNAIRE

FACTOR 2:  COMPANY EXPERIENCE  
The experience of the Offeror and of proposed subcontractors and/or partners intended to occupy a major role will be considered in evaluation and selection. The government will evaluate each Offeror's corporate experience in providing services, which are of similar nature to the work to be performed under the requirement described in this solicitation.  Specifically, jobs that are of similar scope, complexity, contract type, and period of performance, in relation to the requirements of this solicitation are of particular interest to the government.  The government reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews to validate corporate experience and to obtain additional information from other internal and external sources, if known.

FACTOR 3:  TECHNICAL APPROACH 
The offeror is to address their understanding of FEMAs requirement to include their technical approach to fulfilling the requirement. Specifically, the offeror shall provide a draft Phase-In Plan that addresses how they plan to prepare to assume the maintenance and deactivation requirement from the current contractor. This will include obtaining information/documentation on the occupants who are currently living in the housing units such as their address and contact information, what work has been performed to date, as well as any work that needs to be completed before they are transferred to the new contractor. The phase-in plan shall include a timeline with dates and key tasks to be performed starting with contract award up to acceptance of the first twenty (20) units and what steps will be taken during that time to achieve phase-in and assume regular maintenance and deactivation requirements (i.e. finalizing subcontracts, if applicable; hiring new staff if necessary; training staff on the contract requirements; setting up a service call center finalizing internal standard operating procedures to be used in performing the contract requirements, finalize draft plans, etc.). 

In addition, the offer shall address their Quality Control Plan (QCP) to be used in the performance of the contract. Specifically, they should address the quality control methods to be used and if they have used them successfully in other work preformed. The offeror should also address if their quality control plan is IS9000 accredited or has received some other type of quality control accreditation.  SEE ATTACHMENT C - QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN

The Offeror shall address their Operations Plan. This plan will detail how the offeror plans to manage to work (i.e. how work will be staffed, how work will be accepted/issued, what procedures will be followed to ensure work is being performed in a timely manner and of high quality, what corrective action of measures will be taken when work is not preformed in accordance with contract terms and conditions/QC plan, etc.). 

NON-TECHNICAL FACTOR 

1.  Price (Non-Technical Factor):  Contractor is to demonstrate the ability to provide a sound competitive offer associated with the services identified within the solicitation.  The government will evaluate the Offeror's price for fairness and reasonableness.

Price, while being an important factor, is not in and of itself the determining factor in the selection of the successful Offeror for award of the contract contemplated by this solicitation.  Price is not scored/weighted; rather, each Offeror's price will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness as compared to Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE), prices proposed by other offerors, and/or other cost/price estimates for similar requirements.  
 
   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
 
   (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer.

FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition 

FAR Clause 52.226-3 Disaster or Emergency Area Representation (Nov 2007) applies to this acquisition. 

FAR Clause 52-217-4, Evaluation of Options Exercised at Time of Contract Award (Jun 1988) applies to this acquisition.

ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING TO MICHELLE.CALHOUN@DHS.GOV BY AUGUST 27, 2008.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a requirement to purchase a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) Software and software maintenance which provides a licensing, case management, and inventory and management reporting system for the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR).

The IRS intends to issue a competitive RFQ for the brand name Entellitrak.

Entellitrak employs a thin-client implementation that requires no client-side support files. User access to the system is provided exclusively through web-browsers. The browser supported by Entellitrak is MS Internet Explorer version 6.0 or higher and FireFox browser.

Additionally, Entellitrak can support either an Oracle Database or SQL Server Database platform.

There is no other software that has the specialized features/capabilities as the Entellitrak software.  

MicroPact Engineering, Inc. is the developer and sole-source of the Entellitrak software and has not authorized the software to be sold through any other sources outside of their company; therefore, it can only be purchased through this company.

<CONTACT>Patricia L Meise, Phone 410-558-8043, Fax 410-558-8319, Email meisep@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Johns Hopkins University, Department of Neurology, 5200 Eastern Avenue, Baltimore, MD  21224 for a project entitled Follow-up Clinical Dementia Rating Scores for Participants in the Early Markers of Cognitive Change and Alzheimers Disease Study.   The purpose of this procurement is to collect follow-up dementia data on participants in the Early Markers of Cognitive Change and Alzheimers Disease study using the standardized Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale.  The CDR is an instrument that provides crucial evidence for cognitive changes in memory and other skills that occur in normal aging and in individuals who develop memory problems and Alzheimers disease.  There are two forms of the CDR, the subject version and the informant version.  This procurement will provide follow-up data on CDR ratings using both forms.  CDR evaluations are performed annually to examine change in cognitive status over time.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C.  253 (c) (1), FAR 13.106-1 (2) (b).  The cited authority is applicable because Johns Hopkins University is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.   The Department of Neurology at the Johns Hopkins Medical School has both the expertise and facilities for performing Clinical Dementia Rating interviews and analyses.  They are widely regarded as an expert in neurodegenerative disease and are intimately familiar with our research diagnostic criteria, our neuropsychological test battery, and the procedures for contacting participants and informants in this study.  In addition, the staff of the Department of Neurology is well training in administering the appropriate test battery to BLSA participants, and they do so in a manner parallel to the testing protocol used during in-house participant visits.  No other source has the necessary training in administering these tests in a longitudinally consistent fashion in a way that fits the requirements of our research diagnostic criteria for dementia.  In particular, maintaining consistency in testing and diagnoses is crucial in a longitudinal study.   As a participant in the Alzheimers Disease Research Center for many years, they have a wealth of experience in avoiding drift in both the data collection and the diagnostic interpretation.  A survey of the literature in this field and recommendations from investigators doing related research shows that there are no other sources for these services.  The period of performance is 12 months.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of  FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest price, technically acceptable source.

<DESC>Synopsis: 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The Request for Quotation number is HSCG89-08-Q-6PD440 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23. This acquisition is unrestricted. The NAICS is 334210. The contract type will be a firm fixed price purchase order. The Government proposes to solicit quotes for the following: 

Statement of Work: 

48 Channel Audio Logger Recording Playback System 

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Integrated system will provide 48 channels of logging and audio capture with a system-wide storage capacity with a minimum of 5,900GB. A separate, dedicated workstation will be included for audio editing, archival storage, and backup. The server will be expandable to 128 drives and over 250 channels. All hardware and software will be included for installation/integration to existing audio sources in the US Coast Guard facility (Meridian-1 PBX digital T1/PRI line and multiple analog lines are brought out). The Fibre channel disk array is to be expandable to over 35TB, giving the option of keeping years of recordings on-line.

SERVER SPECIFICATIONS

An independent dedicated dual Xenon based audio logging server housed in a 4-U rack mount enclosure provides reliable non-stop recording. Additional channels may be added without server shutdown.
 Two 24-channel USB audio capture units with 40dB ALC on all channels provides the 64Kbps recording speed required to accurately reproduce conversations without distortion.
 A standard fast Ethernet interface connects to the local LAN for secure playback from existing workstations.
 A 5,400GB Fibre Channel disk array system is provided for call storage. This array uses dual power supplies and eighteen highly reliable 10,000 RPM 300GB FCAL hard drives in removable trays. Software RAID provides flexible redundant operation. The large storage capacity gives long-term online storage and eliminates time wasted searching through archival DVDs. Formatted capacity varies depending on RAID disk configuration.
 A gigabit Fibre Channel interface with support for up to 128 FCAL drives expands easily as recording needs grow. Additional storage may be added without shutting down the server. Fast and Gigabit Ethernet interfaces connect to the user LAN/WAN.
 Redundant hot-plug disk storage power supplies can be serviced with the system running. The failure of a single disk drive or disk power supply will not affect the recording performance. An audible alert sounds when service is required.
 A standard 25-pair cable connects directly to a customer-provided RJ-21x with analog audio sources.
 Dual 500GB internal boot drives are provided in removable cartridge trays.
 A full OEM Windows 2008 Server license with 5 Client Access Licenses assures network compatibility and conforms to industry standards. Security and playback permissions are easily controlled using standard Windows security.

PLAYBACK WORKSTATION SPECIFICATIONS

 A separate Dual Xenon based audio editing unit housed in a 4-U rack-mount enclosure ensures that recording is never interrupted by network outages or even when the editing PC is restarted. This unit offers playback, editing, and archival features. By locating the editing unit and logger on a separate network node, both recording and editing will continue uninterrupted throughout network outages. This workstation may optionally be mounted on a desktop instead of the recording rack.
 Dual archiving devices include both a fast 52X E-IDE CD-RW drive and a 16-40X DVD+/-RW drive for reliable backups and rapid production of recordings.
 Dual 500GB internal boot drives are provided in removable cartridge trays.
 A switch is normally provided to ensure that Ethernet connection between the recorder and playback workstation remains available even during LAN/WAN outages.
 Electronic KVM switching permits convenient access to playback and recording units from a single 21 rack-mount LCD monitor and keyboard.
 Capture unit, server, workstation, and all related hardware and options are shipped prewired and installed in a shielded locking 7 foot rack.
 A Windows Vista Ultimate operating system workstation license is included with the playback workstation.

EXTENDED WARRANTY AND 24x7 RAPID RESPONSE SERVICE REQUIRED

This application is a mission critical recording situation and requires rapid service response. The extended warranty includes travel and on-site visits as necessary to maintain and upgrade the logger on an ongoing basis. An 800 number is provided for 24x7 extended warranty support. Periodic security, operating system, and application upgrades are included. A service tech will be available onsite within 4 hours day or night, 365 days a year who will take immediate corrective action. 


OTHER REQUIREMENTS

 System must support direct recording of phone lines, handsets, and radios without reconfiguration. System must support concurrent recording and playback, including playback of calls on all channels while they are being recorded. System must be capable of simultaneously recording 24 channels per recording module. Each recording module must operate independently of any playback workstation or archival device.
 System must include a real time player to provide means of redundant recording and playback of all recent calls via LAN/WAN workstations.
 System must provide a means of real-time playback without delay. Playback must remain operational regardless of server, LAN, or WAN outages.
 System must be capable of audio editing and concatenating across multiple files with the ability to convert to any standard audio format, including MP3, .WAV, G.723, etc.
 System must provide digital watermarking of all calls to establish a chain of custody. This watermarking must remain within the call recording file itself and be visible without proprietary software. The watermark must include a secure header and checksum within each audio file.
 System must provide a method to append an audible announcement of the time, date, and recording agency within the call recording.
 System must include a redundant disk array for fault-tolerant storage of recordings. The array must include a minimum of 9 drives and be expandable to at least 125 drives. A spare disk drive in hot-plug cartridge must be provided.
 This system must be expandable to sustain a minimum of 2 years recordings on disk array without the need to back-up to archival media.
 System must include Microsoft certified security to securely control access to recordings.
 System must include a server and separate playback workstation. Each dual CPU must have speed of at least 3.4GHz and a minimum of 4GB of memory.
 System must provide SAN connectivity for rapid backup and transfer of recordings to network devices including, DLT, DVD, or CD-R/RW media.
 System must provide a real-time, full-color graphic LCD display of activity and true VU levels on all channels at all times.
 System must permit simultaneous secure playback of an unlimited number of channels on at least five workstations via Ethernet connection.
 System must provide a true real-time playback of any or all audio channels which remains fully operational regardless of network outages, server shutdowns and updates, etc.
 System must support a minimum recording rate of 64KBps u-law and a minimum of 40DB Motorola standard automatic level control to allow undistorted reproduction of voice, modem, and FAX data. A minimum recording quality of 64Kbps must be sustained on all recording and playback channels simultaneously.
 System must have an option to automatically compress recordings that have not been accessed after a period of time to conserve storage space.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

 HSAR 3052.20970  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Please include the e-mail addresses of the contracting officer in eSRS for notification in block 13 of the report. (2) Starting with fiscal year 2005, submit your Summary Subcontracting Reports (SSRs &ndash; Old SF 295) and your Individual Subcontracting Reports (ISRs &ndash; Old SF 294) for contracts into the eSRS.

The U.S. Department of Labor has established a web site for submitting this report. The address is: http://www.vets100.cudenver.edu. 1752.224-70 Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (a) Applicability This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act). The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act. (b) Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is &ldquo;information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother&rsquo;s maiden name, etc.&rdquo; (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf). In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. (c) Responsibilities for Handling PII (1) Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. (2) All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location. All contract employees must be: &#61607; responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents. &#61607; responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times. &#61607; responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession. &#61607; Email cannot be encrypted. Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment. Do not send PII in the content of an email. (d) Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (1) OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network. Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment. OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip. Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments. It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agency&rsquo;s network. (2) A password protected file is not secure. Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail. (e) Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII (1) A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic. As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information. In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. (2) OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk &ndash; regardless of the time or day of the week. Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPM&rsquo;s IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention. The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail. (f) Points of Contact (1) OPM contractors must report a breach or potential breach of PII to the OPM Situation Room at: sitroom@opm.gov (202) 418-0111 Fax (202) 606-0624 (2) When notifying the Situation Room, please copy the Contracting Officer at: antoinette.campbell@opm.gov 202-606-4806 202-606-1464 (3) To get help with WinZip, please contact the OPM HelpDesk at: helpdesk@opm.gov (202) 606-4927 TTY (202) 606-1295 (4) If you have questions regarding these procedures, contact the Contracting Officer. 1752.224-71 Freedom of Information Act Requests (a) Offerors are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

<p>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) * Are, * are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) * Have, * have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) * Are, * are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<DESC>Attachment A has been revised for vendors to provide pricing for the following contract line items; 1. Campus Print Advertising (only), 2. Online Advertising(only), 3. Combined Campus Print and Online Advertising, and 4. Posturing / Poster Placement services. 

The following are the Question and Answers for this RFQ.  

1.	The excel spreadsheet listing the newspapers and ad sizes:  Is the ad size (i.e. 2 x 2) a 2 column x 2 inch size? Or is it 2 inches x 2inches?  Most newspaper is bought by column inch (2 column x 2 is 4 column inches).  However, if the ad sizes shown are 2 inches x 2 inches, this will carry a completely different rate/cost.  Peace Corps works in columns by inches and inches by inches, however for this RFQ we are asking for quotes based on column by inches. 
2.	Specifically at the outset, what is the annual budget?  It is estimated that the
annual spend for this requirement is approximately $90,000.00 per year at the Peace Corps.  Individual Regional Office Budgets vary dramatrically.   
3.	Will you be providing the posters? Yes, Peace Corps will provide posters.     
4.	When you ask "paper size" do you mean whether they are tabloid or broadsheet, or do you want the actual dimensions of the paper?  Peace Corps advertises with various papers that use both tabloid or broadsheet format and may ask for the paper dimensions in BPA calls, however we are not requiring this information for this RFQ. 
5.	Are there sizes for the online ads? The various sizes for online ads are; 120x600, 120x90, 468x80, and 728x90 pixels.
6.	Are the prices for print ads, the only determining factor for an awarded contract?  Refer to RFQ page 33.
7.	Please confirm that a company can submit a quote for 2 of the 3 services, such as Print Ads & Online Advertising only  excluding Campus Postering?  Refer to RFQ page 2.
8.	Are the submitted print ad prices  the FIXED PRICES which print ads will be ordered (call) if awarded a contract?  No.
9.	Are creative production services needed for re-sizing of print ads and/or creating online print ads?  No
10.	Will print ads and online ads run the same amount of times (freq)? On other words, each print ad ordered (call), we will also order (call) an Online Ad?  This will be determined in individual BPA calls.
11.	Please confirm - Print & Online Advertising - contractor's fee is a PERCENT.  Yes
12.	Can vendors bid on only a portion of this BPA (campus print advertising)? It appears we can; I just want to double check on this item.  Refer to RFQ page 2.
13.	What sections under 52.212-3 (page 19) do we need to complete in order to submit our BPA?  Refer to RFQ page 19.
14.	I am adding our fee into the cost of the ads on the spreadsheet. Is this the way you expect this spreadsheet to be filled out or should we just list the percentage or fee in our cover letter and have the net ad cost on the spreadsheet.  In completing Attachment A, vendors must list out their proposed % fee in each column that requests the contractors fee for print, online, and combined print & online advertising services.  However for postering / poster placement services; vendors must list out their proposed fix dollar price per poster.
15.	I was just wondering if we could email our response to Solicitation Number: PC-08-Q-GLP3 to you or do you need hard copies?  Quotes shall be submitted via email as stated in the RFQ.
16.	I only see the price information form to be filled out. We will also provide you with a cover letter of our capabilities and prior experience. Correct?  Refer to RFQ pages 29 through 34.
17.	Regarding Columns N-Q, shouldn't the header read "Contractor's Total Price for option year 1-4", not "Contractor's Fee for option year 1-4"? This is because the normal publication price will most likely increase every year, and needs to be combined with our fee to give you as accurate a price as possible.  Columns that have Fee in them is your quoted fee changed to the government.  Refer to question 14.
18.	Garnel, your solicitation may have it, but I can't find the paragraph that gives HUBZone companies the 10% extra for budgeting. I believe it's FAR 52.219-6. Pls incorporate it if possible. Tks.  As this is a 100% Small Business set-aside, there is no price evaluation preference for HUBZone Small Business concerns.
19.	have completed most of the spreadsheet for the Peace Corps BPA. I just had a few questions regarding Columns L & N-Q on the spreadsheet. What is the difference between Column L (Contractor's Fee for 1 year base) & Column N (Contractor's Fee for Option Year 1)? Is Option Year 1 actually the 2nd year of the contract, or should this number (Column N) be the same as Column L?  Option year 1 is the second year of the contract. 
20.	just reviewing what I questioned last week, what sections of the RFQ Word Document (pages 1-34) do we need to complete?  Refer to the Full RFQ and pages 29 through 34 in particular.
21.	When you request the "normal publication price", does that mean the price to purchase the publication directly from the paper?  Normal publication price is the price the publication normally charges to all vendors.  This will not include any discounts you negotiate.  The price charged to contractor is the actual price you have negotiated with the publication.
22.	When the RFP refers to the "contractor" what is this?  It is any vendor that submits a quote.
23.	Is "contractor's fee" our mark up? Yes.
24.	Atlanta University is a 5 school, school consortium. Do you want us to include each school for poster quote?  This should only be quoted as one school.
25.	Can we submit our quote on our own Excel spreadsheet or do we need to use your attached spreadsheet?  Use Attachment A as provided.
26.	- Can we submit directly to your email address?  Yes this is the only way quotes shall be sent.
27.	When do the Peace Corps Regional Offices normally request quotes for their winter advertising requirements?  August for the fall semester and December for the spring semester

<DESC>The following are questions received on this procurement and the answers.  Note: no additional questions will be entertained after 5:00 p.m. today, August 19, 2008:

1)       As you may be aware, CrossMatch no longer manufactures the ID1000 and has roughly 60 still available for sale.  Is TSA willing to receive either CrossMatch or L-1 Identix units in the future as long as they are compatible with Live Scan software?   

	Answer: We would like to cycle through existing units first (former GFE), then could potentially explore other comparable units. However, we would more than likely not want to receive other units as we want to prepare ourselves for the transition to new fingerprinting equipment under the PIV program and meet HSPD-12 requirements.
 
2)       Is TSA adjudication required for staff working on the program?  

	Answer: We assume yes, the contractor would have to be vetted, if he is accessing the 	equipment/network remotely. This means they potentially have access to names, SS numbers, 	other personal info, etc. 

  	If so will it be via the standard eQIP methods?   

	Answer: This would be determined by Personnel Security.
 
3)       Has the Live Scan software been customized in any manner for DHS/TSA?   

	Answer: Only to the extent that a drop down listing was created to identify the type of prints (i.e. TSO, FAMS, FSD Staff, etc.) 
 
4)       Under Section C of the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation there is mention of a resume not exceeding 2 pages.  This is the only reference to a resume in either document.  JSIG intends to provide a resume of our Program Manager.  Is it to be two pages and in addition to the 10 page limitation?   

	Answer: Resumes are excluded from the 10 page count.  
 
5)       Is a past performance summary to be inclusive of the 10 pages of Volume 1?   

	Answer: Yes.   
 
6)       Section 4.1 refers to 24 x 7 Help Desk. What is the current volume of calls being made to the Help Desk? What are the primary hours of operation for the TSA facilities?   

	Answer: When the COTR contact CrossMatch they stat that they receive approximately: 30 to 50 calls between 5/1//07 to 3/31/08, replacing about 15 units because there contract had a replacement clause.  For additional information, over the past four months without a help desk in place, our team has received a minimal number of calls, all of which occurred during regular business hours.
 
7)       Section 4.2 of the SOW mentions a requirement to replace 25% of the total number of deployed scanners.  Is this replacement to occur over the base and option years or is this 25% per year and 75% in total?   

	Answer: 25% over the base and option years combined. 
 
8)       Section 4.3 references software enhancements, are there current enhancements pending, how many enhancements are expected per year?  

	Answer: There are no enhancements pending or specifically forecasted.  Throughout the two years that the CrossMatch contract was in place, we only made one enhancement (referenced in 3 above).  

	Is there a list of past enhancements available?  

	Answer: (Referenced in 3 above)  

	Are software updates being provided via remote access or CD currently?   

	Answer: No software updates have been provided.  

	If by remote access does TSA wish to continue using the method?   

	Answer: If software updates are available, we would want these provided remotely and pushed to the computers when connected to the TSA network.

The contractor shall provide maintenance service for the Gross Gamma Screening System-7 NAL detectors, PMT Base w/MCA &amp; PC. Justification for other than full and open competition is because this instrumentation and the software associated are proprietary and no other manufacturer would have the schematics or the parts to repair the equipment. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide these services/supplies are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice to the Contract Specialist within 7 days of the publication date of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and&nbsp;is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries may be sent to Lynn Walling by email at lqw5@cdc.gov or by fax to 770-488-2820</p>
