In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.  
AWARD WILL NOT BE WITHHELD AWAITING QUALIFICATION.  For qualification information/source approval requests contact OC-ALC/BC, 3001 Staff Drive, Ste #1AC85A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3009.  
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<p>TITLE OF CONTRACT</p>
<p>Foam Depopulation Equipment Hydraulic Transport Trailers Purchase and Delivery</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. National Veterinary Stockpile (NVS) is the nation's repository of critical veterinary supplies, equipment, and service resources. It exists because of the nation's concern after 9/11 that terrorists could release animal diseases of catastrophic proportions that would</p>
<p>&bull; deplete State and local response inventories, <br />&bull; generate surge requirements that would overwhelm commercial sources, and<br />&bull; prevent unaffected States from providing significant help for fear of the threat crossing their borders</p>
<p>The NVS' ability to deploy within 24 hours large amounts of critical veterinary resources ensures States have what they need to respond to catastrophes and other outbreaks.</p>
<p>The NVS deploys products like animal vaccine, antiviral, equipment, or therapeutic products to appropriately respond to damaging animal diseases affecting human health and the economy that are likely to be unavailable in sufficient quantities for large outbreaks. States, industry (as part of the incident command system), and NVS commercial partners will use the products and related equipment to respond to large-scale outbreaks.</p>

<DESC>It is anticipated that a sole source contract will be awarded, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and FAR 15, to Horton Analytical Chemistry Services (HACS)/Dr. James Horton, Bel Air, MD, for providing unique and/or highly specialized services in conjunction with the management, administration, and technical support in the ongoing Project Management for Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel (PM NSCM) research, technology evaluation and application program.  These services will support Phase I (Proof of Concept) and Phase II (Field Testing) efforts of identifying, testing, evaluating, and adopting technologies that will enhance the PM NSCM's missions and projects.   <br>  <br> Non-stockpile materiel includes recovered chemical weapons and miscellaneous materiel.  The PM NSCM has developed an ongoing technology evaluation program that assists in fulfilling its mission.  Technology evaluation and application activities include continuing needs assessment; improvements of currently used technologies; surveillance to identify potentially beneficial, commercially proven, technologies; technologies down-selecting, testing and adapting. <br>  <br> Dr. Horton has provided extensive chemistry and analytical support to PM NSCM for sixteen years, resulting in highly specialized, long-term institutional knowledge to the Chemical Materials Activity (CMA) in the areas of chemical agent neutralization, incineration, alternative destruction processes, assessment, the development of analytical methodologies for sampling and analysis, and monitoring of chemical agents.  He has extensive knowledge and expertise in areas involving recovered chemical warfare materiel (RCWM).  Dr. Horton has a proven and trusted working relationship with PM NSCM as well as research organizations such as the Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center (ECBC), Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Sandia National Laboratory(SNL), and Idaho National Laboratory (INL).  This work and these relationships allow Dr. Horton access to personnel, systems, and technologies required for execution of this contract.   <br>  <br> Dr. Horton has unique and highly specialized experience working with the Project Manager for Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel (PM NSCM), ECBC, INL, and other research and analytical organizations in the development of technologies applied to the Explosive Destruction System (EDS) and other CMA processes and equipment.  Technologies evaluated and developed include chemical monitoring methodologies (liquid and vapor systems), laser decontamination and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), treatment using  HUMASORB (neutralization process),  and the laboratory research required for chemical treatment of all PM NSCM agents and industrial chemicals associated with RCWM and destruction of former production facilities.   Dr. Horton has also provided extensive contributions for Non-Stockpile's GAP Analysis (which details the technical areas where improvements are needed) and the review process for an alternative destruction system for industrial chemicals.  <br>  <br> Dr. Horton has gained unique and highly specialized experience and long-term institutional knowledge supporting the overarching PM NSCM technology evaluation and application program, as managed by Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure, Inc.  under its task order 0009 of its basic contract DAAA09-02-D-0006.  Under this support, Dr. Horton was instrumental in working with Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure, Inc. and Northrop Grumman in setting up a proof of concept project for assessment of the non-intrusive Deuterium-Tritium (D-T) neutron generator system which was completed in Fiscal Year (FY) 2012.  Dr. Horton's expertise will also be instrumental and required in developing, monitoring, testing, and in the assessments of blinds and unknowns using the D-T system in FY 2013.   Dr. Horton was also instrumental in working with Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure in the Phase 1 Proof of Concept effort for Laser Decontamination. It is anticipated that Dr. Horton will also be instrumental in working under the new OREP Follow-On Contract (recently awarded). <br>  <br> The overall period of performance is anticipated to be twelve (12) months after award.  The award will be as a contract under FAR Part 15, utilizing non-commercial terms and conditions. <br>  <br> The proposed action is for unique services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole source basis, with HACS under the authority of FAR Part 15.  As such, an electronic request for proposal will be sent to HACS; no formal written request for proposal will be issued.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals; however, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  All submitted information by interested parties that is received within thirty (30) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The submitted information by interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br>  <br> Award of the subject contract is anticipated to be no later than 20 February 2013.   <br>  <br> Email responses shall be submitted no later than 14 February 2013 to the Contract Specialist, Jeff Decker, at Jeffrey.J.Decker2.civ@mail.mil.  <br>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a sole source purchase order to Titertek Berthold, 330 Winn Drive, Huntsville, Alabama 35805 for the acquisition of yearly maintenance service for the Quadflex III EC, Auxiliary Digiflex, Quadflex III EC, and Auxiliary Digiflex. The purchase order will be for a base period of 12 months and two option periods of 12 months each.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. <br /><br />Titertek customized the Quadflex III liquid handling systems for the unique application of spotting human blood on special filter paper. These instruments are one-of-a kind products and only exist at CDC. They are imperative for the continuity of the Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program and Titertek is the only one allowed to provide maintenance for service of these instruments.<br /><br />As the original equipment manufacturer of these instruments, Titertek is the only contractor that can provide a) on-site repair which is usually the next normal business day response to service calls; b) emergency service for in-warranty instruments to correct any defects that impair the proper performance of the instrument at no additional cost; c) preventative maintenance and emergency repair actions during normal business hours, coordinated so that actions can be accomplished with a minimum of interference to operational use of the equipment; d) access to technical phone support during normal business hours; e) trained service staff qualified to diagnose problems and repair and maintain Titertek equipment; f) Titertek Field Engineers and Technicians and augmented by qualified independent, factory-trained technicians employed to provide more timely and cost effective service; g) scheduled planned yearly maintenance. <br /><br />Titertek provides service manuals to engineers containing service procedures applicable to the equipment trained on. Engineers periodically receive service information and updates, often consisting of compilations of recent problems and suggested methods of correction. The original equipment warranty information states that the manufacturer only ensures performance at original levels if genuine manufacturer parts or manufacturer trained technicians provide service. Titertek is the original equipment manufacturer and they will not provide service for equipment that they have not previously maintained.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Titertek Berthold. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2013-Q-15297 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN December 21, 2012. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />

 ******   THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY   ******
 
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Activity 7, Charleston, SC, Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center intends to solicit and negotiate a Design- Build, firm-fixed-price contract to provide design build A/E and Construction Services to convert 3-B South to Clinical Space; specifically renovate GI Suite -3-B South; to include finishing Architectural/Engineering Design and providing labor, material, equipment, and supervision as per the request for proposals for a completed project.

A Request for Proposals (RFP) for this project is estimated to be released on or about February 4, 2013.  Details of all dates and events, including site visit will be available in the upcoming solicitation.  Interested parties are encouraged to periodically re-visit the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website: www.fbo.gov for further information concerning this intended acquisition.
 
 PROJECT 534-12-925  DESCRIPTION:    SCOPE OF WORK: 

VA Technical specifications and other design criteria including but not limited to VA
Design Manuals and VA Program Guides are provided by reference only in the RFP.
These documents are available at http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/ and shall be utilized by the
Design-build team to develop the Construction Documents. The design and construction
within the limits of this project shall comply with all referenced criteria. A list of VA
Master Specifications with select anticipated specifications for the project noted are
provided in the RFP. This list shall be used as a basis for specification development by
the Contractor. Additional VA Master Specification Sections may be required to
complete the project and shall be determined by the Design-build contractor. Refer to
VHA Program Guide 18-3 for Design and Construction Procedures including but not
limited to Topic 1 which lists Codes, Standards and Executive Orders.


CRITICAL DESIGN ISSUES

The VA Medical Center will be occupied and fully operational throughout the project.
The design-build contractor shall ensure that there are no interruptions in any utility
service and that all outages are scheduled and approved by the COTR. Provide at
least two weeks written notice to COTR prior to outages. Facility operation shall not be
hindered or adversely impacted by the Construction Activities. Most work will be
completed during regular business hours, Monday -Friday, 7:00 AM-5:30 PM; however,
work in specific areas of the project that may be noisy, produce excess vibration, or
require outages must occur after hours or on weekends unless an exception is
specifically granted by the COTR.

Due to the sensitivity of the occupancy of the VA Medical Center, care shall be taken in
the selection of construction methods and activities to limit noise and vibration.

EXISTING CONDITIONS

The site for the project is the 3B South area of the VAMC Charleston which is currently
occupied by the existing Ambulatory Surgery Recovery and Prep areas, 23-hour Patient
Observation Rooms, nursing staff, and various Human Resource and/or administrative staff.

ASBESTOS CONTAINING MATERIALS INVESTIGATION 

For further information regarding asbestos containing materials, refer to the VA's
"Asbestos Re-Assessment Report" dated June 11, 2010 prepared by GEL Engineers,
LLC, drawings dated 2002 and 2008, and the "Limited Asbestos Assessment Update
Report" prepared by S&ME (Project No. 1135-12-432) dated September 25, 2012
included in the RFP package.

UTILITIES

Record drawings will be issued by the Charleston VAMC that indicate the current
location of known utilities within the limits of work. These Record drawings must be
field verified closely by the Contractor as discrepancies may exist on the drawings.

RECORD DRAWINGS

The Charleston VA Medical Center has specific requirements and guidelines
regarding CAD standards that must be followed during the course of a project.

At the beginning of a project, the VA Medical Center will issue a compact disc
including the official current version of the VA Master As-Built files in CAD format.
This compact disc will be issued in person at a briefing by the Charleston VAMC
AutoCAD manager. He will explain files provided on the compact disc and required
VA protocols. Other files are available as needed in addition to those files included
on the compact disc. The compact disc provided by the VAMC includes specific
instructions for use of the Master As-Built drawings as well as creation of new CAD drawings.

The .dwg files included in the RFP were based on the Master CAD As-Built files
issued during the RFP process. Be advised that the VAMC undergoes continuous
renovation. It is important that the most current version of the Master CAD As-Built
files are used as the project moves forward.


Be advised that all conditions and dimensions shall be field verified. Given the age of
the facility and history of the site, items not indicated in the Master CAD As-Built files
may be encountered.
Submittal of all CAD files and print files to the VA COTR must occur at the following
stages:

_ Design Development and Construction Document Phases

_ Post Construction or Record Drawing Phase

_ After receiving construction as-builts, the design-build team shall update all CAD
files to reflect modifications made during the course of construction

_ As-built Drawing Phase

_ After approval of Record Drawings by the VA COTR, the design-build team shall
update all affected Master VA CAD files to reflect modifications made during the
course of construction

ARCHITECTURAL

Service Description

Gastroenterology, often referred to as GI, is a medical specialty that involves the
diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the digestive system. Typically, the extents of
the services offered by the gastroenterology unit are determined by the VA Central
Office in conjunction with the staff of the individual facility.
Gastroenterology services in VA hospitals provide diagnosis and treatment for
diseases of the esophagus, stomach, intestine, and related organs such as the liver
and gall bladder. The most common gastroenterological diseases encountered are
ulcers and colitis.

Description

As stated above, the Scope of Work presented by the VAMC involves the renovation
of the third floor south west (3B South) portion of the VAMC Charleston to
accommodate the relocation of the Gastroenterology Department (GI) from its current
location on the fourth floor north central section (4A). Four primary services are
represented in the area of work requiring specific coordination with each department
during the course of design:

_ GI Suite - Medicine Service

_ Ambulatory Surgery including 23 Hour Observation - Nursing Service

_ Sterile Processing - SPS Service

_ Limited 3B North Ward - Nursing/Surgical Service

Of the above, the 3B North Ward is an adjacent Patient Care Unit not directly included
in the scope of work but may be impacted directly or indirectly by the design; some
core services may be adjusted due to shared space therefore requiring some
modification, thus 3B North may be involved in the process. In addition Supporting
Services for the area include:

_ ITD - Data and Telecommunications

_ Housekeeping

_ Dietetics - Nourishment Kitchen Coordination

_ Biomedicine - Telemetry and Patient Monitoring

_ Pharmacy - Medication Issues

The design, as presented in this RFP, is a result of a series of meetings with various
user groups pertaining to the spaces and presentations and approvals by the VAMC
Director's Pentad. It is, therefore, the intent of the VAMC that the design develop
further and not change substantially from the approved design.

Phasing

Generally, phasing has been provided on the Drawings, in order of importance: direct
patient care, indirect patient care, family support areas, and staff support areas which
are not directly related to patient care.

Because the construction will be adjacent to and within working hospital areas, impact
to existing Ambulatory Surgery and Patient Care functions shall be minimized during
construction. Additional phased construction (beyond that indicated) may be required
for any work in such areas and therefore, the construction schedule and design shall indicate a viable approach to such issues.

The impact to 3B North as well as such spaces below the construction in 2B South or
above the construction in 4B South shall be minimized. Consider impacts to risers,
utilities, and services impacting other areas of the facility. HVAC services shall be
maintained to occupied areas during construction. Likewise, egress shall be
maintained.

Ceiling construction shall match the ceiling grid in adjacent phases or previous
existing construction to ensure consistency. In some cases ceiling construction may
need to be performed after normal business hours.



Demolition

The demolition within the area or work consists of total removal of select interior walls,
ceilings, doors, windows and floor finishes and all attached equipment. In addition,
the project will remove the induction unit HVAC systems within the area of work as
well as remove the existing HVAC systems in rooms within the area of work that do
not have induction units to the greatest extent feasible within budget. Therefore,
patching of the existing slab will be required as a result of said induction unit removal.
Associated with this renovation are upgrades and modification to utility systems,
building equipment, finishes and support space. Any systems affected must be
considered in the phase requirements including but not limited to HVAC, plumbing,
telecommunications, cable, life safety and exiting, electrical power (both normal and
emergency) lighting, data, signage, etc.

Additionally, asbestos containing floor tiles and mastic are to be demolished in areas
where present.

Sprinklers and sprinkler lines are to be protected during demolition and replaced per
the direction of the RFP document.

New Work

New work will consist of the construction of new interior partitions and certain interior
smoke resistive corridor walls, new doors, window, new floor finishes, and new ceiling
systems. Additional new work is described in "Description" above.

Phase Two of the solicitation shall be comprised of a written technical and a price proposal, which will be evaluated separately in accordance with Part 15.  The Phase Two written technical proposal will address the evaluation factors of Technical Solution and Energy & Sustainable Design. The Phase Two price proposal shall set forth the offerors price for the seed project for the MACC contracts.
  Phase Two will require submission and evaluation of evaluation factors specifically designated as Phase Two Factors.  Ratings for these factors will be combined with the rating for factors evaluated during Phase One to determine a composite rating and ranking for each offeror participating in Phase Two.

NOTE:  Any offeror who receives an Unacceptable rating for any Technical Factor under Phase One or Two will receive an overall Unacceptable rating.

The Government reserves the right to limit the number of awards under this solicitation to five  (5) contracts.  The duration of the contract(s) is for one (1) year from the date of contract award with four (4) one-year option periods.
  The total five-year (base and four one-year options) estimated construction cost for all contracts is not to exceed $95,000,000.00 for the life of the contract.  The limit is the maximum for the life of the contract of $95,000,000.00. The range for individual task orders estimated cost is approximately $1,000,000.00 to $20,000,000.00; however, smaller and larger dollar value projects may be considered.  The minimum guarantee for this contract for each awardee is $5,000.00 over the life of the contract.

Visiting vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check.
 Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at it own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed/ renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS is forthcoming.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires
Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to
support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.

listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Marketing Service, 1400 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20250 is seeking vendors who can provide Operations and Maintenance for an AMS hosted Microsoft CRM (Customer Relationship Management) COTS solution. This solution, titled Country of Origin Labeling Functional Analysis for Compliance and Trends System (COOL FACTS) is an operational CRM solution that supports Country of Origin Labeling Program. <br />Country of Origin Labeling is a labeling law that requires retailers, such as full-line grocery stores, supermarkets, and club warehouse stores, notify their customers with information regarding the source of certain foods. Food products, (covered commodities) contained in the law include muscle cut and ground meats: beef, veal, pork, lamb, goat, and chicken; wild and farm-raised fish and shellfish; fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables; peanuts, pecans, and macadamia nuts; and ginseng. Commodities are excluded from mandatory COOL if they are considered processed food items. The COOL program ensures compliance with the regulation by conducting retail surveillance activities (retail reviews) and supplier traceback audits in grocery stores across the country that meet the requirements of COOL. The COOL FACTS application consists of an internal CRM solution that is utilized by AMS personnel to administrator the COOL Program and a secure externally facing .Net portal that is utilized by State cooperating agencies, (approximately 400 users). The portal includes functionality to manage retail review assignments; supervisor review capability; invoice submission; and user account update features. Both technical components of the solution are hosted locally on virtualized Windows 2008 servers. Other components of COOL FACTS include SQL Server 2008 Enterprise, CRM 2011 Enterprise, and a Microsoft Unified Access Gateway (UAG) device. AMS owns all software, hardware, and licenses to support this solution. AMS hosts both a Pre-Production and Production environment for COOL FACTS. This permits for comprehensive testing of any builds prior to production release. The COOL FACTS solution went live in April 2012. The support period with the incumbent expires in February 2013.

<p>AMS has onsite Tier 1 and Tier 2 support staffed by government personnel. This support is able to handle basic and intermediate COOL FACTS technical questions and problems.</p>
<p>AMS is looking to compliment this with a deeper set of technical support services. These support services should be able to affectively understand initial report, diagnosis the problem, troubleshoot the problem, isolate, correct, test, and then deploy code fixes and/or minor changes to the system to keep the system operational and online.</p>
<p>AMS believes that a mix of onsite and offsite support services would be optimum. AMS will provide onsite access, office space, and network access including a computer to work from. AMS does not believe that full time support is needed for this requirement.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement to determine the availability of potential vendors (including, but not limited to, small business (e.g. 8 (a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women-owned small business) that can provide reagents and consumables to support research and the reference laboratory work done across the laboratory branches of provide support to the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention based on the supply list in this Sources Sought Announcement.
<p><br />Background:</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) has an ongoing need for molecular biological reagents and consumables to support research and the reference laboratory work done at various laboratory branches. The reagents and consumables are biochemical components for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification, cloning and sequencing bacterial and viral RNA and DNA. The various polymerases and transcriptase, dNTPs, PCR kits and gels are reagents and consumables that are involved in the amplification and QC of nucleic acids and are optimized to amplify a wide range of targets reliably and provide superior results for routine PCR amplification.<br />The expression and cloning kits contain the biochemical reagents necessary for further nucleic acid manipulation. The amplified PCR product of interest is inserted into a various vectors with convenient restriction sites allowing for additional study. Other supplies include different cycle sequencing kits formulated for different applications and templates. Cycle sequencing is a method in which successive rounds of denaturation, annealing, and extension in a thermal cycler result in linear amplification of extension products. NCHHSTP research utilizes Dye Terminator sequencing chemistry which color codes the DNA with fluorescent dyes. The sequencing reactions are then purified up with BigDye Xterminator which scavenges all unincorporated BigDye&reg; terminators. These products are then injected into a capillary for electrophoresis on one of the sequencing platforms. Sequencing reagents and consumables arrays, polymers, and buffers that are specific for the different sequencing platforms are also currently in used at the NCHHSTP lab branches.</p>
<p>CDC/NCHHSTP requires support of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to fulfill an ongoing need for molecular biological reagents and consumables to support ongoing research. Many of these reagents and supplies are to be used with the existing sequencing platforms installed at CDC. Other reagents are to be used to study gene expression in pathogens. Use of these reagents is required to assure continuity of research within the laboratories.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide CDC with rapid turnaround for an ongoing need of reagents and consumables in support of the NCHHSTP laboratory branches based on the attached supply list.</p>
<p>Capability Statement: <br /><br />Vendors who believe they have the ability to provide all the supplies listed are encouraged to submit a capability statement. The pre-configured reagents and supplies shall fit directly into 3130, 3130xl and 3500 Genetic Analyzer platforms and the manufacture, development and distribution of consumable of pcr, cloning and DNA sequencing reagents must comply with the requirements of ISO 9000. The vendor shall be able to provide all supplies at a rapid turnaround through the year at any given time.</p>
<p>Capability statements shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, and business size and status (e.g. small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women owned small business).</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City intends to award a Frim Fixed Price Purchase order.

This requirment is an upgrade to the current Differential Global Postioning System (DGPS) mounted in FAA's BE-300 Flight Inspecition Aircraft and Hangar 9. This upgrade in equipment is an enhancement to Global Positioning System that uses a network of fixed, ground-based reference stations to broadcast the difference between the positions indicated by the satelite systems and the known fixed positions. These stations broadast the difference between the measured satelite pseudo ranges and actual (internally computed) pseudo ranges, and receiver stations may correct their pseudo ranges by the same amount. 

This requirment will update the BE-300PL DGPS and Hangar 9 Base Station DGPS. Operational Test and Evaluation and unertainty assessment of the AFIS Rev T have been interrupted and delayed by the inability of the DGPS to ahieve and maintain RTK Fixed. RTK provides the accuracy that is required to support uncertainty assessment. Currently the DGPS RTK Fixed cannot be maintained during local flights in OKC or other locations. When the RTK Fixed is lost during flight, it is rarely regained prior to landing.

<DESC><strong>Introduction</strong><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding:  (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether there are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndromes (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), maintains a portfolio of contracts to support the development of (1) therapies for HIV infection and its complications and co-infections, and (2) microbicides for preventing the sexual transmission of HIV.  Services provided under these contracts assist investigators in academic settings and small pharmaceutical firms in filling specific gaps in their drug development plan as they advance their product towards clinical investigation.  Information about these contract resources can be found at the following NIAID website: http://www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/resources/atrg/Pages/default.aspx</p>
<p>The NIAID anticipates awarding an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract to one organization that meets the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements of the solicitation, providing a guaranteed minimum award.  Task orders for specific tasks requiring specialized expertise will be issued after the award of the base contract.</p>
<p>This is a recompetition of two existing contracts, "Pharmaceutical and Chemical Resource for AIDS Drug Development" with SRI International under contract number HHSN266200700024C, and "Safety Evaluation of Anti-Infective Agents" with SRI International under contract number HHSN272200700043C.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br />The purpose of the proposed contract is to provide a suite of product development services.  These services are provided to investigators on a case-by-case basis for a wide variety of product candidates, rather than to advance a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway.  These services have helped investigators obtain critical data and products needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships, fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed before entering clinical trials.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements</strong><br />Offerors should have the qualifications, experience and capability to perform this requirement.  The Contractor will carry out tasks in the following three areas:</p>
<p>1)	Administrative and Technical Support:  This task area includes general administrative and technical activities to support all future Task Orders awarded under the contract.</p>
<p>2)	Formulation and Dosage Form Manufacture: Under this task area, the Contractor shall conduct studies in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) to support the development of formulations of potential therapeutic agents and Microbicides.  Targeted formulations shall include tablets, capsules, lyophilized powders, solutions, suspensions, aerosols, gels, films, or rings for vaginal or rectal delivery.</p>
<p>3)	Pharmacology and Toxicology: Under this task area, the Contractor shall conduct studies to assess the pharmacology and toxicology of potential therapeutic agents and Microbicides.  Testings shall be conducted in vitro or in relevant animal species.  Studies shall be performed in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) guidelines (21 CFR 58) when requested.  Additionally, the Contractor shall conduct all animal studies in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) or its equivalent.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Requirement and Anticipated Period of Performance</strong><br />The anticipated period of performance is for seven years beginning May 9, 2014 through May 8, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement/Information Sought</strong><br />Capability Statements should clearly convey information regarding the respondent's capabilities, including: (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.</p>
<p>Interested contractors must submit a capability statement (five page limitation, excluding resumes) describing their company's experience and ability to perform this effort that includes the following: (1) a summary list of similar work previously performed; (2) the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; (3) resumes for proposed key personnel, including the Principal Investigator, that reflect education, and previous work relevant to the proposed requirement; (4) a general description of the facilities and other resources needed to perform the work; and (5) demonstrated ability to carry out the work.</p>
<p>Each response should include the following Business Information:</p>
<p>a.	DUNS number<br />b.	Company Name<br />c.	Company Address<br />d.

All offerors must be registered in the SAM,  located at http://www.sam.gov/</p>
<p><strong>Teaming Arrangements:</strong> All teaming arrangements should also include the above-cited information and certification for each entity on the proposed team.  Teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information is identical to N68335-13-RFI-7101 which has been simultaneously posted under PSC Code 62 (Lighting Fixtures and Lamps).
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. It shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract as a result of this request for information.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst NJ (NAWCADLKE) is requesting comments from industry on the DRAFT Statement of Work and Specification currently being developed to successfully design, develop, integrate, test, qualify, and produce a Sustainment Lighting System (SLS) for the United States Marine Corps. Information provided in response to this RFI will be used by the government in the development of its acquisition strategy and refinement of the SLS system specification.</p>
<p>The mission of the NAVAIR EAF Program is to provide the Marine Corps with the equipment necessary to support the rapid deployment and establishment of self-sustaining airfields in austere, expeditionary operating environments with a minimum of infrastructure. This capability is achieved through the installation of one or more EAF subsystems, which include airfield surfacing systems, expeditionary arresting gear, terminal guidance systems and airfield lighting and marking systems. Headquarters Marine Corps has identified the need to replace legacy EAF airfield lighting systems in order to increase operational capability. Presently fielded EAF airfield lighting systems are not capable of supporting runway operations in Category I (CAT I) Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) meteorological conditions, and a need exists to improve compatibility with Night Vision Devices (NVD) at both runways and Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) sites.</p>
<p>The SLS shall be comprised of two individual, but interoperable, airfield lighting modules to appropriately scope the capability and optimize the equipment necessary to meet the diverse operating needs of Marine Aviation during deployments and at garrison training sites. These two modules and their contents are described as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; VTOL Module shall provide the components necessary to support nighttime vertical lift aircraft operating in Visual Flight Rules (VFR) meteorological conditions at remote sites and within an airfield complex without the need for an external power interface. The VTOL Module consists of edge lighting, wind indication and controllers (both portable and pilot-activated).</p>
<p>&bull; Runway Module shall provide the components necessary to define the operating surface of a 6,000 foot long bi-directional runway and its associated taxiways, in addition to providing visual approach aids, wind cones, informational lighting and signage, and controllers. The Runway Module shall provide additional runway edge lighting and associated cabling and hardware to expand the runway by up to 2000 feet in length as a separate package. The composition of components must allow for system installations to be scaled for different airfield dimensions and for the ability to continue aircraft launch and recovery operations as meteorological conditions degrade. The Runway Module shall include three approach light systems in order to support runway operations in VFR, Non-Precision IFR, and CAT I IFR meteorological conditions, as defined by the Marine Corps below:</p>
<p>VFR 1000 foot ceiling, 3 statute mile visibility<br />Non-Precision IFR 250 foot ceiling, &frac34; statute mile visibility<br />CAT I Precision IFR 200 foot ceiling, &frac12; statute mile visibility</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Detailed system performance parameters are provided in the supporting draft System Specification and draft Statement of Work. Comments and feedback related to these documents are welcomed and all questions will be responded to in an anonymous fashion through further postings against this synopsis.</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI should consider the suggested page limitations of 1 written page, 12 point font, per bulleted item below. Brochures, pamphlets and other marketing or sales media should not be provided in response to this RFI. Respondents to this RFI should ensure that the following areas are addressed:</p>
<p>&bull; Interoperability and control issues arising from the use of products from multiple sources.<br />&bull; Approach to obsolescence mitigation for critical technologies, e.g. LED, batteries.<br />&bull; Application of Open Architecture in order to minimize issues with redesign during the system's life cycle.<br />&bull; Software approach to allow for Government support of system software over the system's life cycle.<br />&bull; Experience with software development and company CMMI certification<br />&bull; Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the solutions provided in response to this RFI.<br />&bull; Ease of upgrade/compatibility with third party hardware.<br />&bull; Maximum design flexibility directed at future competitive procurements.<br />&bull; Obstacles to meeting any area within the SOW or Specification.<br />&bull; Level of development required to meet any area within the SOW or Specification.<br />&bull; Identify technical risk areas.<br />&bull; Provide a notional schedule to accomplish tasks outlined in SOW/Specification.</p>
<p>Material identified as Company Proprietary provided in response to this RFI will be treated as such by the government. Any interested parties must contact Michelle Prinston at michelle.prinston@navy.mil to request a copy of the Statement of Work and Specification.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication that the PMA-251 Program Office or NAVAIR will contract for the items contained in the RFI. NAVAIR will not pay respondents for any information generated for or provided in response to this RFI. The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any costs associated with the information submitted in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking small business sources for a construction project entitled: Lower Granite Spillway PIT Tag Monitoring System.  The work is located at Lower Granite Lock and Dam (Whitman and Asotin Counties, Washington).  This will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract.  The magnitude of construction is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 and 100% performance and payment bonds will be required.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $33,500,000.   <br>  <br> This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify businesses with the capability to accomplish the work.  This is not a solicitation.  Only those firms who respond to this announcement by submitting the following information will be used in determining whether to set aside this requirement.   <br>  <br> A)	A list of current or past projects demonstrating technical experience with work of a similar nature to that listed in the Summary Scope of Work.

A statement from your surety is NOT required. <br>  <br> F)	Cage Code and DUNS number. <br>  <br> Submit this information to Elaine Vandiver, Contract Specialist, via email to Elaine.M.Vandiver@usace.army.mil. Your response to this notice must be received on or before 3:00PM on January 28, 2013. <br>  <br> Summary of Scope of Work: <br>  <br> NOAA Fisheries and other regional fish managers use Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tag data to track fish movement of anadromous species as they go downstream in their outmigration and as they come back upstream heading to their spawning grounds.  Information collected can be used to estimate bypass passage rates, run timing, survival and smolt to adult return rates as well as evaluate the effects of project operations. <br>  <br> Currently, the Corps of Engineers does not have a way to collect PIT Tag data from outmigrating juvenile salmonids and steelhead passing over spillways at Lower Granite Dam.  Studies six to ten years ago indicated an average of 65% of fish passing the dam on their way downstream passed over the spillway and, as a result, were undetected by existing monitoring systems.   <br>  <br> In an attempt to collect PIT Tag information from some of the fish passing over the spillway at Lower Granite Dam, the Corps of Engineers will install a monitoring system in spillway bay #1.  Spillway bay #1 functions as the surface passage route at Lower Granite and passes an estimated average of 75% of those fish passing over all eight of the spillway bays.   <br>  <br> The monitoring system will be installed at two locations in spillway bay #1.  Part of the system will consist of a series of pass-over antennas recessed in the spillway surface in the lower part of the concrete spillway chute just above the tailwater surface.  A second part of the monitoring system will consist of pass-by antennas suspended in the forebay just upstream of the RSW entrance.   <br>  <br> In the spillway chute location, a series of antennas will be recessed into the spillway surface so that the electromagnetic field projects up through the spillway flow and PIT Tag data is collected from tagged fish as they pass over the antennas.  With flow in the spillway shut off, a contractor will mine or excavate two parallel trenches approximately 6.5 feet deep and 7 feet wide (approximately 170 cy) across the full 50-foot width of spillway bay one.  Multiple government-furnished antennas will be installed in the trenches and covered with either a concrete cap or a system of UHMW skid plates to isolate them from spillway flow during spillway operation.  Aluminum shield boxes will be fabricated and installed in the concrete to isolate the antenna fields from magnetic elements in the spillway.  New concrete placed (approximately 130 cy) will require non-metallic rebar and non-magnetic aggregate.  Associated signal and power cables will be recessed below the spillway surface as well or routed as required to connect the antennas to the regional PIT Tag data system.  During concrete cutting/mining operations, all process water and waste material will be collected for treatment and upland disposal.  Construction materials or fluids will not be allowed to come into contact with Snake River water.  Communications cable will include copper antenna cables between the antennas and transceivers and fiber optic cables from the transceivers back to the existing data system.  A personnel access walkway will be fabricated off-site and installed in the fishway channel to access government-furnished transceivers and other communication/power equipment.  The walkway will be approximately 135 feet long by 6 feet wide weighing up to 25,000 pounds.  It will be attached to the wall and ceiling of the fishway gallery supported by concrete anchors as required.    Passages will be drilled, approximately 6 inches in diameter, 30 to 40 feet in length, between the antenna trenches and the fishway gallery to run cabling from the antennas to the communication/power equipment in the gallery.  Drainage passages approximately 6 inches in diameter will also be drilled from the antenna trenches to the fishway gallery.    <br>  <br> In the forebay location, the contractor will fabricate and install a steel support structure (up to 30,000 lbs of steel) with up to 15-ton wire rope hoists and end trucks capable of raising the set of pass-by antennas up out of the water to clear debris or perform maintenance.  Again, the antennas and transceivers will be government-furnished with the contractor providing all remaining required materials. <br>  <br> The government expects to award a construction contract in August or September 2013 and the completed system will be tested in March of 2014 and begin operation in April 2014 with the annual spring spill season.  The construction period will take place through the winter and will likely include severe weather with potential for freezing conditions and the associated hazards in the work area.  Work will occur over or near water with fall and over-water hazards.  The construction schedule is tight and there will be no room for schedule extension.  <br>  <br> The government expects to issue this project as a Request for Proposal, where contractors will be evaluated on previous experience with concrete excavation, concrete construction, electrical/communication/sensitive electronic grounding installation, heavy construction in marine environments, steel fabrication, and construction zone isolation from environmentally sensitive aquatic environments. <br>

This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice issued in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to conduct market research.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The VA is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) seeks to identify offerors who will provide maintenance for Oracle software products deployed throughout VA and currently under maintenance (see Attachment A).   VA intends to include a true down provision which would allow VA to reduce cost for quantities of products no longer used and removed (i.e. 300 to 250 databases) or when the product is completely removed from the VA network (i.e. 300 to 0 databases).

<DESC>Synopsis: Request for Information (RFI) - Global Horizons Science and Technology<br /><br />1. Description<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) on Global Horizons science and technology (S&amp;T) research, operational concepts, and mission support innovations to support Air Force projected missions in the near-term (FY2013-17), mid-term (FY2018-22) and far-term (FY2023-27). NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY PROPOSAL OR INFORMATION SUBMISSION AND SUBMITTING INFORMATION DOES NOT BIND THE AIR FORCE FOR ANY FUTURE CONTRACTS/GRANTS RESULTING FROM THIS RFI. <br /><br />2. Background and Requested Information<br /><br />The Air Force is requesting information on revolutionary global horizons science and technologies that address the challenge of future Air Force needs across all of its core mission functions for potential inclusion in the <em>Air Force Global Horizons</em> study. <em>Global Horizons</em> is a study to create an integrated, Air Force-wide, near-, mid- and far-term S&amp;T vision to advance revolutionary capabilities to support core Air Force missions. <em>Global Horizons</em> will identify state-of-the-art S&amp;T and best practices in government and the private sector. It will analyze current and forecasted capabilities, threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences across core AF missions to identify key S&amp;T gaps and opportunities. It will articulate an AF near- (FY2013-17), mid- (FY2018-22) and far-term (FY2023-27) S&amp;T vision to fill gaps, indicating where AF should lead (creating or inventing novel solutions for core AF missions), follow (by adopting, adapting, or augmenting others investments), or watch key technologies. In alignment with the National Security Strategy and Department of Defense strategic guidance, the study is intended to address S&amp;T enabling Air Force operations in the domains of air, space, and cyberspace across Air Force core functions which include Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Air Superiority, Space Superiority, Cyberspace Superiority, Command and Control (C2), Global Integrated Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (GIISR), Global Precision Attack, Special Operations, Rapid Global Mobility, Personnel Recovery, Agile Combat Support (ACS) and Building Partnerships. These core functions are detailed in the Air Force Basic Doctrine, Organization, and Command (AFDD1, 14 October 2011, p.43, http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFDD1.pdf). The study will also consider DOTMLPF (Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, and Facilities). The study will leverage capabilities and experience within and across government, industry, academia, national laboratories, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), and international partners. The AF will consider global forces (e.g., global demographics, technology proliferation, health, climate change) where there exists compelling data and evidence that this will drive change that is most relevant to USAF operations. It will focus on both US and foreign driven game changers that exist or are emerging across a broad set of sectors (including but not limited to: manufacturing and materials, transportation and logistics, energy and utilities, healthcare and pharmaceutical, communications and information technology, financial services, education and training etc.) that have the most promise for revolutionizing critical dimensions of Air Force operations such as cost, speed, readiness, efficiency, or effectiveness. <br /><br />The Air Force seeks the "assured global advantage across air, space, and cyberspace" where these key dimensions are defined as:<br /><br />&#61550; <em>Assured</em> - Ensured operations in congested, competitive, and contested (including denied) environments in spite of increased dependencies, vulnerabilities, and threats<br /><br />&#61550; <em>Global</em> - Worldwide operations in global vigilance, global reach, and global power<br /><br />&#61550; <em>Advantage</em> - an agility, resilience, speed, effectiveness or other edge over adversaries to ensure operational pre-eminence<br /><br />&#61550; <em>Across</em> - capabilities within and across missions<br /><br />&#61550;<em> Air, space, cyberspace</em> - we require integrated, full spectrum solutions to include cross-domain Command, Control, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and mission support/sustainment<br /><br />The Air Force performs operations in and through the global commons (e.g., land, air, space, cyberspace) to deliver global vigilance, global reach, and global power in support of regional and global combatant commands for a broad range of humanitarian, peacekeeping, and combat missions. Air Force requirements encompass defense, intelligence, and combat operations as well as support of combat such as doctrine and workforce development (education and training), acquisition, logistics, sustainment, energy, etc. Global vulnerabilities open new attack surfaces for exploitation by a range of threats. Threats include but are not limited to disruptions that might be local or global, intentional or unintentional, or of human or nature in origin. Adversary objectives might include theft (of material or intellectual capital), denial, deception, degradation, disruption, or destruction. Accordingly, operations must be assured by mitigating vulnerabilities that adversaries might exploit and developing strategies and technology that assure missions in contested environments. Attack vectors might be conventional (e.g., physical attack) or unconventional (e.g., special operations, information operations) or attacks against operational readiness, cost, or knowledge/expertise. <br /><br />While the Air Force Global Horizons vision will focus on Title 10 authorities for organizing, training and equipping, a collaborative approach and peer review across other services, agencies and federal departments and coalition partners will ensure appropriate coordination and understanding of interdependencies with relevant defense, homeland security, and intelligence authorities. It will also draw upon the deep knowledge, experience, and capabilities within global industrial and academic centers of gravity. <br /><br />The Air Force is seeking information on revolutionary science and technology and systems as well as innovative Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) that will support, improve, augment and in some cases extend mission range and scope. In addition, the Air Force is interested in operational innovations that provide immediate and long-term applicable, cost-effective operational capability and technological superiority for Air Force operations. Also of interest are enabling mission support elements and supporting best practices that provide the foundation for capabilities across the other domains. Special interest is on S&amp;T that can provide game changers that will revolutionize multiple classes of USAF operations or missions (e.g., autonomy promises cost, speed, and accuracy improvements across C2, ISR, and many operations in air, space, and cyberspace.). In general, RFI responses should address solutions in the air, space, cyberspace, C2, ISR, mission support, threat analysis or projections, and/or S&amp;T areas that provide revolutionary (i.e., 10x to 100x) as opposed to incremental (&lt;10x) performance improvements over the current state of the art. <br /><br />The assured global advantage is critical in all domains in which the Air Force operates. The Air Force must maintain its excellence of air, space, cyberspace, C2 and ISR operations in fixed and expeditionary environments in a world of proliferating technology, growing global interdependence, and increasing uncertainty. While each domain has unique challenges, we will focus on a portfolio of technologies that meets a broad spectrum of future Air Force requirements.
<p><br />AIR<br /><br />A crucial part of achieving the Air Force mission involves obtaining and maintaining superiority in the air domain. Within the air domain, forces exercise degrees of control or levels of influence, characterized as parity, superiority, or supremacy. The US has enjoyed air superiority in all conflicts since the Korean War, however, near-peer competitors and future contested and anti-access/area denial environments raise the possibility of air parity or even the risk of conceding superiority to the adversary. Air power encompasses air combat, global strike, mobility, refueling, and special operations. The asymmetrical dependence on cyber of our air platforms may render air superiority in a contested cyber environment even more elusive. Independently, the US Air Force is often the first responder in times of crisis-to lay down expeditionary bases and create the backbone of critical supply lines. Pervasive global access is a key enabler in maintaining air superiority and an ability to promptly react to natural disasters or human-caused contingencies. But being an agile, expeditionary air force is expensive and complex, posing challenges for sustainment. And the platforms and weapons that are highly effective today risk new threats in the mid and far term. <br /><br />The Air Force seeks information on how revolutionary technologies can enhance platform assurance or be employed to ensure air superiority across air combat, global strike, special operations, or mobility operations. Several technologies need to be researched in the coming years to continue our success in the air domain within the context of providing persistent, assured global access using remote, dispersed bases with extended supply chains. These include, but are not limited to: stealth, propulsion, air vehicle design and subsystem integration, structures life extending technologies, fuel/energy efficiency, formal verification of complex systems, test and evaluation in contested environments across the entire acquisition lifecycle, improvements in modeling and simulation for platform and weapon design as well as operator training, software for guidance, navigation and control as well as electronic warfare, secure air-to-air and air-to-ground communications and data links, advanced communications and datalinks for network-enabled weapons, anti-tamper technologies, self-protection and warning, encryption, high performance on-board processing, precision navigation and timing, survivability against high power microwave (HPM) or directed energy threats, positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) for platforms and weapons in contested environments, autonomous operations, advanced human machine interfaces, intelligent sensors, advanced munitions, and the entire logistics systems. <br /><br />SPACE<br /><br />Military forces have always viewed controlling the "high ground" as a position of dominance and advantage in warfare. With rare exceptions, whoever owned the high ground owned the fight. Space assets offer an expansive view of the Earth, operating high above the planet's surface; satellites can see deep into an adversary's territory, with little risk to humans or machines. Today, control of space as the ultimate high ground is critical for space superiority and assures the force-multiplying capabilities of space power. Tomorrow, space superiority may enable instant engagement anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Space assets have not only enhanced our national security but have also fundamentally changed military operations. Space power is defined as the total strength of a nation's capabilities to conduct and influence activities to, in, through, and from space to achieve its objectives. Space power is integrated throughout joint operations as both an enabler and a force multiplier. Cyber operations supporting, enabling or controlling space assets and missions are a key ingredient for achieving battlespace superiority.</p>
<p>Space operations are essential to space power, providing a uniquely persistent presence over key areas of the world through the effective employment of space capabilities. Space power provides the joint fight with permanently "forward-deployed" satellites and adds another dimension to the joint force's ability to posture quickly and achieve battlespace superiority. Space power bolsters US global presence because it is not limited by terrestrial anti-access concerns. Airmen exploit this global presence and produce force-multiplying capabilities like instant global communications, timely missile warning, near-persistent surveillance and reconnaissance, and precise positioning, navigation and timing (PNT).</p>
<p>Revolutionary advances are needed in all space segments including space launch, space born segments (including space-to-surface ISR), satellite ground control and data processing systems, and end user receiving systems will be required to maintain space superiority. In order to ensure continued dominance in this domain, continued investment into enabling space technologies is required. Accordingly, there are multiple challenges and requirements for advanced security, energy, sensing, propulsion, communication, resilience, interoperability and integration, cost, usability, and assured global access and control. For example, intelligent space maneuver could provide extended life for assets in orbit, autonomous satellite command-and-control as well as establishing intelligent ground processing centers that would help address responsiveness, resiliency, and readiness requirements.</p>
<p>CYBER<br /><br />Air Force missions across the air, space and cyber domains are increasingly dependent on cyberspace operations. Cyberspace is a source of both strength and vulnerability. The almost annual doubling of the cyber technology base has created critical vulnerabilities for our adversaries to attack and exploit. Expanded interconnectivity through cyberspace has exposed previously isolated critical infrastructures vital to national security, public health, and economic well-being. Adversaries may attempt to deny, degrade, manipulate, disrupt, or destroy critical infrastructures and AF missions through cyberspace attack, thus affecting warfighting systems and the nation as a whole. The Air Force must have assured, trusted, resilient and affordable communications and networks to effectively and confidently execute its mission to protect and defend this nation. The Air Force is interested in S&amp;T and operational support innovations that can assure missions, dynamically map cyberspace with critical mission functions and provide integrated mission/cyber situation awareness, including timely indications and warning. Technology is required that will provide trusted, resilient and agile architectures that can mitigate risks, limit adverse consequences and /or enable operating through a cyber attack. Analysis of commercial off the shelf technologies (COTS) to assess threats and vulnerabilities is of interest. Validation and verification methods are sought which will ensure an in-depth knowledge and trust in COTS and government owned technologies (GOTS) hardware and software components prior to their usage in weapon systems. Linkages between cyber and intelligence along with capabilities for the command and control of cyber assets are also of interest.</p>
<p>Techniques which will augment human performance to provide force-multiplication through cyberspace are sought. S&amp;T for integrated, full-spectrum cyberspace operations to develop and demonstrate trusted, validated, verified capabilities capable of delivering a full range of cyber effects, to fuse data to provide real-time or near-real time ISR data using cyberspace, and a means to measure and assess the effectiveness and degree of assurance of a delivered cyber effect prior to usage are of interest. Technology and techniques which will provide new opportunities for AF advantage in cyber operations and support are sought.</p>
<p>C2 and ISR <br /><br />The success of the Air Force's capacity for Global Vigilance, Reach and Power is directly proportional to the effectiveness of its C2 and ISR capabilities. The Air Force's ability to dominate in C2 and ISR has been demonstrated repeatedly on the world stage. Command and control (C2) is about decision superiority - having timely, actionable, trusted information to make decisions and communicating decisions to the right people at the right time. C2 is defined as the exercise of authority and the direction by a Commander over assigned and attached forces in accomplishment of the mission. C2 typically operates in a monitor, assess, plan, and execute (MAPE) process which requires the following: global situation awareness, course of action analysis and selection, surveillance and strike coordination, execution monitoring, and battle damage assessment, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) is planning and directing intelligence activities, collecting critical information, processing data, analyzing information building intelligence products, and disseminating intelligence to support planning, decision making, and execution of operations. C2 and ISR provide a persistent, collaborative environment comprised of people, processes, systems, and tools to support a broad range of military operations. Modern conflicts demand fast, efficient, and assured C2 and ISR operations that are agile, responsive, and survivable in contested environments. <br /><br />Technological advances in the transfer and handling of information created the information age. Advancements in our C2 and ISR systems and the Global Information Grid (GIG) have greatly accelerated information sharing immensely. This can burden commanders with "information overload" challenging the ability to synthesize data and make decisions. Moreover, C2 and ISR are conducted of, in and through the air, space, and cyberspace domains. Our air, space, and cyber systems are at varying degrees of maturity, with limited information being exchanged across the domains. A "Layered Sensing" approach must provide military and homeland security decision makers at all levels with timely, actionable, trusted, and relevant information necessary for situation awareness to ensure their decisions achieve the desired military/humanitarian effects. Layered Sensing is characterized by the appropriate sensor or combination of sensors/platforms, infrastructure and exploitation capabilities to generate the data required for that situation awareness.<br /><br />One of the key challenges of integrated global operations include the synchronization of forces across the air, space, and cyber domains in time and purpose to achieve effects. The air, space, and cyber domains possess dramatically different characteristics with respect to speed, time, distance, and governing physics and forces. This requires new technologies to fuse information from sensors and information sources, synchronizing kinetic and non-kinetic assets to achieve effect across the domains, timely situation understanding enabled by continuous assessment, and autonomy/decision aids to assist humans to enhance agility and responsiveness. This cross-domain synchronization should eventually lead to full cross-domain integration of forces. Other challenges include Identification of Friend or Foe (IFF) procedures and the potential of cross-domain (air/space/cyber) fratricide. The Air Force is interested in novel and unique approaches to enable global C2 and ISR superiority in an environment that is not constrained by time, distance, and geographical boundaries. <br /><br />MISSION SUPPORT<br /><br />Mission support provides the foundation that enables global engagement and is a linchpin that ties together Air Force core competencies. It includes those actions taken to create, deploy, employ, generate, sustain, protect, and redeploy air, space, and cyberspace personnel, assets, and capabilities through all peacetime and wartime military operations worldwide. The Air Force is interested in innovative solutions to key mission support challenges including, but not limited to, workforce acquisition and development (including training and education), medical support, timely and relevant acquisition of technologies, test and evaluation, and incorporation of sound practices throughout the acquisition life cycle of Air Force weapon systems. This includes, for example, lean, ready, and affordable global logistics and sustainment in a joint and coalition world.</p>
<p>Interests include but are not limited to modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) approaches that cost effectively blend live, virtual, and constructive environments and support cross domain training, capability development and testing, and joint/coalition readiness. This must enable interoperability of systems residing across the world at DOD acquisition centers, S&amp;T laboratories, contractor facilities, operational bases and in allied countries. Cross domain (air, space, cyberspace) planning, targeting and assessment tools (available today primarily for kinetic weapons in the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM)) are needed that can revolutionize acquisition or operational processes. Advanced planning tools as well as analytics for effective and efficient acquisition and use of future capabilities are also needed. Innovative acquisition models with track records of success in time, cost, and effectiveness for research development, test, and evaluation are of interest. Revolutionary medical and/or bioinformatics advances with demonstrated success in human performance protection and/or augmentation are of interest. Finally, revolutionary advances in cross-cutting enabling areas such as manufacturing, materials, energy, electronic warfare, financial services, and so on, that could redefine threats or opportunities across USAF domains of operation are of interest. These are intended as examples as opposed to a comprehensive list of our mission support interests.</p>
<p>REVOLUTIONARY S&amp;T, GAME CHANGERS</p>
<p>Within and across the core functions described above, the Air Force is interested in revolutionary concepts and innovative solutions that can meet the challenging needs of the Air Force. These solutions are sought for all Air Force core functions referenced above. Described technologies should also indicate the areas of improvement over current state of the art technologies in quantitative metrics including, but not limited to, efficiency, effectiveness, robustness, resiliency, size, cost and sustainability. The Air Force is interested in solutions not focused exclusively on commercial viability but rather game changing revolutionary advances in the challenging threat environments we are expected to operate on in the near, mid, and far term. Innovative basic science research is also of interest if there is concrete evidence of technical viability such as peer-reviewed publication, prototypes, or demonstrations as well as cross cutting applicability to two or more Air Force mission domains (i.e., air, space, cyberspace) or core functions. The focus of the submissions should be on advanced technology solutions in the idea generation or early development stages, unless they are deployed solutions from other industrial, academic, or non-profit sectors that could revolutionize (i.e., 10x to 100x improvements in) Air Force operations.</p>
<p>Related, the USAF is interested in both US and foreign game changers that exist or are emerging across a broad set of global business sectors (including but not limited to: manufacturing and materials, transportation and logistics, energy and utilities, healthcare and pharmaceutical, communications and information technology, financial services, education and training, etc.) that have the most promise for revolutionizing Air Force operations in terms of critical dimensions such as cost, speed, readiness, efficiency, or effectiveness. This could include S&amp;T innovations from industrial, academic or non-profit leaders in various sectors which offer opportunities in the near, mid, or far term for transition or transfer to radical (i.e., 10-100x) improvements in cost, timeliness, efficiency or effectiveness for core Air Force functions. This could include revolutionary products, processes, and/or business models. Incremental advances (less than 10x improvements) are not of interest.<br /><br />As just one example of a potentially revolutionary area, consider human performance. Airmen are the key to Air Force mission success and, in a sense, are the most precious commodity in the Air Force. In order to operate successfully, Airman performance must be sustained, optimized, and enhanced, not just for today's challenges, but with an eye to future revolutions in socio-technological systems that threaten to degrade or even nullify human performance. Performance runs on a continuum from initial selection and training through the physical, physiological, psychological, and cognitive attributes that must be sustained biomedically and technologically across a career affected by the natural aging process.<br /><br />Key challenges to human performance are the increasingly complex socio-technical systems that levy inordinate demand on cognition, induce fatigue, and erode attention/situational awareness thus degrading weapon system performance. Consequently, revolutionary concepts are sought to include, but are not limited to, definitive accession of specified skills and rapid training without attrition; DOTMLPF solutions that eliminate fatigue; nano-, info-, bio-, and cogno-technology solutions to enhance (or augment) human performance within an acceptable ethical framework; maintenance of situational awareness in complex systems; and defining human relationships with autonomous systems. Advances in human performance must be discovered with emerging global forces in mind as well as the human performance threats of adversaries.</p>
<p>GLOBAL TRENDS</p>
<p>The USAF is also interested in studies, analyses, and/or activities that forecast global forces (e.g., global demographics, global technology proliferation, global health, climate change, economic shifts, business model trends, etc.) where there exists compelling data and evidence that this will drive change that is most relevant to (threats to or performance of) future USAF operations across air, space and/or cyberspace, to include enabling core capabilities such as training, logistics, maintenance, energy, healthcare, etc.. Responders should indicate the basis, evidence, and/or underlying data for the relevant trends and/or forces, wherever possible indicating concretely how these trends will drive Air Force futures. As desired, respondents can send in an actual global trend analysis report in lieu of a quad chart (See below). <br /><br />GLOBAL THREATS</p>
<p>The global scope of DoD and Air Force networks, systems, and operations presents adversaries with broad opportunities for exploitation and attack. U.S. adversaries may seek to exploit, deceive, disrupt, deny or degrade the networks, systems, platforms and payloads the Air Force depends upon 24/7 for global operations (this includes attacks on confidentiality, availability, and integrity). Threats to global operations are presented from external threat actors, malicious insiders, and via supply chain vulnerabilities. Of particular concern are threat activities which undermine critical dependencies, national critical infrastructure, or give an adversary asymmetric advantage. Revolutionary methods to defend not only federal but also industrial base assets are of interest. Our military strength ultimately depends on economic vitality and thus sustained intellectual property losses erode both U.S. military effectiveness and national competitiveness in the global economy.</p>
<p>Adversaries will continually adjust their tools and tactics, making a perfect defense impossible. However, an integrated, Air Force-wide, near-, mid-, and far-term science and technology vision to advance revolutionary capabilities to support core Air Force missions can help provide an edge. Innovative methods and insights into how to most effectively forecast and anticipate future threats are also welcome. Respondents can send in classified responses via appropriate channels (See below) and also can send in global threat reports that address global Air Force concerns in lieu of a quad chart (See below).</p>

<a href="mailto:meredith.a.hart.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division B</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army intends to procure quantity (1 each) Monitor and Control (M&C) subsystem for the Regional Hub Node (RHN) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) equipment at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, quantity (1 each) M&C Prescribed Load List (PLL) Spare Kit at Arifjan, and New Equipment Training (NET) at Arifjan.  The Government requires replacement of the current M&C subsystem that is part of the GD antenna system part number 9mKXK-12941 that is part of the Regional Hub Node (RHN) Satellite Communication equipment used at Arifjan.    This effort includes on-site installation.  The Period of Performance for this effort is 150 days After Contract Award.  The resulting contract will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract type.  The proposed source is General Dynamics Satcom Technologies, Inc., 4825 River Green Parkway, Duluth, Georgia 30096.  General Dynamics is the only source with the knowledge of the technical design requirements of its 9mKXK-12941 antenna system. The Government does not possess drawings/schematics that detail vital design information that would enable any other source to replace the Monitor &Control (M&C) Subsystem, which is nearing obsolescence. The integration of hardware and software changes that are necessary to replace the M&C Subsystem are tightly coupled and therefore only a source with extensive knowledge of this antenna system can accomplish the required efforts without extensive delays.  Any other source would need to reverse engineer GD's antenna system to understand its design before it could implement the required M&C replacement and this would result in delays of at least 8 months. Additionally, to complete the proposed effort it will be necessary to replace the High Power Amplifier Controller in the Antenna Hub.  This will require new switching equipment and a new waveguide to replace the existing waveguide runs.  Detailed knowledge of the Antenna Hub wiring is required to perform this modification; and only GD possesses that knowledge.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  <br> Contracting Office: Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, 6001 Combat Drive, Aberdeen Proving Ground 21005   <br> Point of Contact: Meredith Hart, Contract Specialist, meredith.a.hart.civ@mail.mil

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the  procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on  the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-01-285-8354<br />Name:		Cleaner, Marker Board, 8 oz<br />Description:	8 ounce marker board cleaner in pump spray bottle that cleans and reduces shadowing on all whiteboards, erasable marker boards, melamine and porcelain steel boards. Not intended for chalkboard surfaces. UOI is BT.</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-00-NIB-2160<br />Name:		Cleaner, Marker Board, 22 oz<br />Description:	22 ounce marker board cleaner in pump spray bottle that cleans and reduces shadowing on all whiteboards, erasable marker boards, melamine and porcelain steel boards. Not intended for chalkboard surfaces. UOI is BT.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be  authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the Defense Logistics Agency, Aviation Supply Chain, Richmond, VA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN			6850-01-285-8354<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	QRT551; SAN81803; GJO75626; UNV43661; HPC-1009-OD / 340338; 887114; 5PWH2; 5PWH3; PSP-CL8OZ; PR1601/PR-160-0000/PR-160; 94008/DIX94008; ACCLSPRAY01; 6001-48/12; G0730387; SPS8-12; <br /> CL-08</p>
<p>NSN			6850-00-NIB-2160<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	SAN1752229; B005194CA4 / 580; B003ZJNO9W</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List), or Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than January 30, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Date: Thursday, February 7, 2013</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Location: <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Westin Arlington Gateway Hotel at 801 N. Glebe Road Arlington, VA 22203</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">This Special Notice, DARPA-SN-13-17, is to announce that DARPA is holding a Proposers&rsquo; Day for Intrachip/Interchip Enhanced Cooling Applications</span> (ICECool Apps)<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;"> on February 7, 2013 in Arlington, VA. ICECool Apps is the second thrust of DARPA&rsquo;s ICECool program, following the ICECool Fundamentals effort<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>(DARPA-BAA-12-50), and specifically addresses the thermal management needs of RF MMIC power amplifiers and embedded high performance computer modules. The Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for ICECool Apps, DARPA-BAA-13-21, is expected to be released prior to the Proposers&rsquo; Day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">The specific goal of ICECool Applications is to enhance the performance of such defense electronic systems through the judicious application of intrachip/interchip microfluidic cooling and on-chip thermal interconnects that will together enable the removal of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>kW/cm<sup>2</sup> heat fluxes on the chip and kW/cm<sup>3</sup> heat densities in the targeted electronic modules. Successful completion of this program will substantially raise module-level heat removal density, without raising the operating temperature, thus enabling greater functionality per unit volume in high-performance, RF and computational electronic systems.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">The ICECool program is exploring disruptive embedded cooling technologies that will overcome present thermal performance limitations, while significantly reducing size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) of defense electronic systems. These goals will be accomplished by integrating microfluidic cooling into the chip, substrate, and/or package structure, while significantly shrinking the dimensions of the cooling solution and providing superior heat removal capability at the chip and module levels. Implementation of embedded thermal management and integration of thermal design with functional design and power delivery are needed to remove the heat dissipation associated with full realization of the inherent capability of emerging solid state device technology. The integration of ICECool concepts and techniques into the commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) supply chain, along with development and implementation of electrical-thermal co-design techniques, is aimed at overcoming the thermally-limited performance, as well as excessive weight and volume, of traditionally-cooled COTS electronic modules and sub-systems, when used in defense applications.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">The Proposers&rsquo; Day will be held on Thursday, February 7 at the Westin Arlington Gateway Hotel at 801 N. Glebe Road Arlington, VA 22203. The preliminary Proposers&rsquo; Day Agenda includes an ICECool Vision presentation by the DARPA ICECool Applications Program Manager (Dr. Bar-Cohen), brief presentations by academic and industry teams on current and planned &ldquo;embedded cooling&rdquo; efforts, and primer on responsding to DARPA solicitations by a representative from the DARPA Contracts Management Office (CMO). Following lunch, an opportunity will be provided for brief individual meetings with Dr. Bar-Cohen and breakout rooms will be available for organizations wishing to discuss potential collaborations. Both of these can be requested on a first-come, first serve basis by emailing </span><a href="mailto:DARPA-SN-13-17@darpa.mil"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">DARPA-SN-13-17@darpa.mil</span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;"> with the type of meeting being requested in the subject line.</span></p>

<a href="mailto:osita.umeh@faa.gov">Click here to email Osita Umeh</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to publicize the intent of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to extend the current Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP) contract (ATOP Contract) with Lockheed Martin in accordance with Acquisition Management System  3.2.2.4 for 8 years (two year base year and six 1-year option periods) to continue the development and lifecycle support service for ATOP programs Ocean21 Air Traffic Control (ATC) system.  The cost of the contract extension is estimated to be more than $400,000,000.00 assuming all options are exercised.  The current contract with Lockheed Martin is set to expire July 31, 2013.  

Ocean21 provides automation capabilities that support oceanic procedural and radar airspace. The Ocean21 system integrates a wide range of surveillance data types (primary and secondary radar, Automatic Dependent Surveillance -Contract (ADS-C), High Frequency (HF) and Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) position reports), system-maintained electronic flight data, CPDLC and Air Traffic Services (ATS) Interfacility Data Communications (AIDC) support, and automated conflict detection for a seamless ATC environment for the controller.  The design provides functionality to reduce controller workload and separation minima, thereby increasing airspace capacity.  This procurement also provides services to include software maintenance, software enhancements, field maintenance, depot support, system engineering, training and technical support, and provides options for new Ocean21 sites, NextGen oceanic related software, and technical refresh.

The FAA has been engaged in a contract dispute with Lockheed Martin related to the extent of the Agencys data rights in restricted rights software elements within the Ocean21 system.  In consideration of all of the issues, the FAA has determined that it is in its best interests to enter into an agreement with Lockheed Martin to resolve the dispute and address the FAAs rights to certain restricted rights computer software that form core components of the Ocean21 system (ATOP Settlement Agreement).  Based upon the ATOP Settlement Agreement, the FAA will enter into an 8-year single source extension or follow-on of the ATOP Contract with Lockheed Martin.  A summary of certain terms of the ATOP Settlement Agreement is also provided as an attachment to this Announcement.  

For any entities who would be interested in supporting the prime contractor Lockheed Martin with this requirement, please submit the attached Business Declaration form and the attached interested parties information sheet, and provide a copy of your SBA 8(a) certification letter if applicable.  For small businesses this effort would be under the principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541512, Computer Systems Design Services, with a size standard of $25 M.  The FAA, based on feedback from industry, will create a list of interested parties, and provide the list to the prime contractor for its consideration.  All interested parties will be included on the list for the purpose of promoting subcontracting/teaming.  

All questions should also be sent via e-mail to the FAA Contracting Officer, Osita Umeh, via e mail at osita.umeh@faa.gov.  Please use ATOP Notice to Industry in the subject line and include your company name and contact information in your e-mail.  Responses must be received by no later than 5:00 p.m. EST on January 23, 2013.  The FAA will not consider responses received after this due date and time.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this announcement.  Any proprietary information should be marked.  This announcement is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

<DESC>Notice of Intent
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Stanford Research Systems (SRS), of Sunnyvale, CA for SRS SIM Electronic Controller System for the Sensor Science Division (SSD) of the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.</p>
<p>The mission of the Sensor Science Division is to develop and provide national measurement standards and services to advance physical science and technology in optical radiation, temperature, pressure, vacuum, flow, and related physical phenomena. A recent Innovative Measurement Services initiative endeavors to replace mercury manometer pressure standard with one based on gas density measured at optical frequencies.</p>
<p>NIST's Sensor Science Division currently owns and utilizes two (2) Stanford Research Systems SIM900 Mainframes, which will be part of the Innovative Measurement Services initiative. In order for NIST to measure gas density to the highest accuracy it is necessary to lock a laser frequency to the resonance of a Fabry-Perot Cavity. The lock will be accomplished by providing a control signal to the lasers such that they remain at resonance. The purpose of the SRS SIM Electronic Controllers is that they provide the full suite of electronics required to process the control signal, and allow the initiative to be fully successful.</p>
<p>Stanford Research Systems (SRS) is the sole manufacturer and distributor of their instruments in the United States. SRS has proprietary technology and their control system is the sole system capable of 100 percent compatibility and integration of the existing SIMS</p>
<p>No other companies The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 334515, with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by January 29, 2013 will be considered by the Government.</p>

Since its founding, more than 200,000 Americans have served as Peace Corps Volunteers in 139 developing countries that request assistance. The Peace Corps mission is to promote world peace and friendship through service to others. Peace Corps Volunteers live and work within the community they serve abroad, learning the local language, and contributing skills. This technical assistance is one of three goals of the Peace Corps. The other two revolve around cross-cultural understanding gained as the people of other countries begin to understand an American as well as the cultural experience brought back and shared when the Volunteer returns home. More information about Peace Corps can be found on our web site at www.peacecorps.gov. <br /><br />The US Peace Corps is performing market research for a "Medical Evacuation Services" activity. The Peace Corps Office of Medical Services (OMS) has an ongoing requirement for the services of air-ambulance service provider to provide assistance in the event of a medical emergency for Peace Corps Volunteers (PCVs) who are either working or traveling abroad. Emergency medical evacuation is used for acute, life- limb- and organ-threatening emergencies that require emergency medical evacuation by a chartered aircraft to ensure timely delivery of care. In the case of these emergencies, Peace Corps OMS will request the services of an air ambulance contractor to evacuate a Volunteer. Emergency air evacuations require a coordinated effort between the overseas Peace Corps post, OMS, and the air ambulance contractor. The contractor must accept referrals for such services 24 hours per day 7 days per week via telephone or other secure electronic means.<br /><br />The Peace Corps is seeking information from the current commercial air ambulance providers as part of ongoing market research.

What is your NAICS code?<br />4. Does your business maintain any relevant accreditation related to medical evacuation services? If so, please provide additional information.<br />5. Does your company have access to aircraft hubs located outside the US? If so, please provide a brief explanation of how you would provide a global response to a medical evacuation of a Peace Corps Volunteer. <br />6. Is your company the sole provider of the air ambulance services, or do you sub contract/partner with other organizations? <br />7. Does your company have experience doing worldwide emergency medical evacuations? Does your company have experience doing regional emergency medical evacuations? Can you company perform both global and regional emergency medical evacuations? <br />8. Does your company take medically evacuated patients to accredited (i.e. Joint Commission International) hospitals and facilities? If so, which accreditation standard if followed for the hospitals and facilities? <br />9.

<p>This RFI is issued solely for informational, market research, and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the United States Department of Commerce (DOC) is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the United States (U.S) Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.

It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.</p>
<p>1.0 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The United States Department of Commerce consists of the following fourteen distinct and independently managed operating units (OU): the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the Census Bureau, the Economic Development Administration (EDA), the International Trade Administration (ITA), the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Office of the Secretary (OS) and the Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).</p>
<p>Commerce offices are located throughout the continental United States of America with major campuses at the following locations: Washington, DC; Denver, CO; Bowie, MD; Gaithersburg, MD; Fairmount, WV; Alexandria, VA and Boulder, CO.</p>
<p>Commerce has approximately 90,000 computer workstations and servers (endpoints) distributed over these fourteen operating units and offices.</p>
<p>Although Commerce currently has investments that support decentralized cybersecurity technologies and operations, with the exception of some tracking, reporting, oversight and policy functions, the Department lacks centralized enterprise-wide cybersecurity capabilities necessary to provide Department-level situational awareness, a single, common operating picture of security for the Department's systems, remediation and response, and other centralized functions necessary to monitor and manage the Department's cybersecurity posture.</p>
<p><br />2.0 RFI OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>In accordance with OMB memoranda M-10-15 , which requires agencies to "continuously monitor security-related information from across the enterprise in a manageable and actionable way", Commerce seeks information from interested managed security service providers that can provide 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, near real-time network security status information to enable timely risk-based decision-making at the Commerce Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Commerce OU CISO and Commerce OU computer security incident response team levels.<br /><br />Commerce aims to develop a budgetary estimate for this managed security service and seeks interested service providers with the following capabilities:</p>
<p>&bull; Experience with collecting and consolidating network security status information from multiple, disjointed, highly-federated environments<br />&bull; Experience with analyzing network security status information feeds and extracting actionable information that can be immediately used by a CISO or incident handler<br />&bull; Experience in the preparation of the monthly CyberScope reports<br />&bull; Experience in extracting data from network security status information feeds to support ad hoc data calls from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <br />&bull; Experience in detecting network intrusion activity and providing directly actionable recommendations<br />&bull; Experience in detecting network malware and providing directly actionable recommendations<br />&bull; Experience in detecting network transit of unencrypted personally identifiable information and providing directly actionable recommendations<br />&bull; Experience in detecting network access to malicious websites, including but not limited to, phishing websites, and providing directly actionable recommendations<br />&bull; Experience in detecting advanced persistent threats and providing directly actionable recommendations<br />&bull; Experience in collecting and consolidating network security threat information from multiple sources and applying them to the analysis of network security status information feeds<br />&bull; Experience in reporting computer security incidents to incident handlers and tracking them until they are closed</p>
<p>In light of the Federal Chief Information Officer 25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology Management, dated 9 December 2010, and subject to acceptance into the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), Commerce will consider secure, reliable and cost-effective cloud technology options (as defined by NIST Special Publication 800-145) for this managed security service.</p>
<p>3.0 ACQUISITION STRATEGY</p>

<DESC>The Healthcare Acquisition Activity-North intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price, sole source award to Acclarent for their Multi Angled Endoscope at Wright Patterson AFB. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) for commercially available items. Only one responsible source is reasonably available due to the fact that Acclarent is the only vendor for this propietary equipment that is already in place. The procurement of the Acclarent Cyclops Multi-Angle Endoscope system will expand on the capabilities and will seamlessly expand and integrate with the existing systems, components, and equipment to allow the Wright Patterson ENT center to standardize its systems. Currently, Wright Patterson is using existing Acclarent equipment in its day to day operations. This vendor is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only source that can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources (e.g., unique features, function of the item, direct replacement parts/components for existing equipment, patent, copyright, and proprietary data). The Endoscope will be used in endoscopic sinus surgery. The Acclarent Cyclops Multi-Angle Endoscope is the only scope that affords the surgeon the ability to change angles during a procedure while inside a patient//-s sinus eliminating the need to continually change between scope sizes during a procedure. This feature provides the surgeon with better visualization in addition to reducing the time of the operation by eliminating the need to continually change scopes.The Acclarent Cyclops Multi-Angle Endoscope is a 4mm rigid endoscope that has the capability of varying direction of view from 10//- to 1000, which is altered by the direction of view dial. The direction of view is indicated by visible markings on the scope body. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 339112 and the size standard is 500 Employees. All responsible sources may submit a response. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement will be based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A solicitation will not be issued. Interested firms may identify their interest in writing to the Government point of contact. Responses to this notice must be received no later than 11:00 AM 22 January 2013. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. The point of contact for this action is Jeremy Michaels at jeremy.d.michaels@us.army.mil.

POSITION TITLE: Justice Advisor<br />6. MARKET VALUE: $80,728 - $118,552 (FS-02 Equivalent)<br />7. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year from date of award and four option years<br />7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Mexico City, Mexico<br />8. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:<br />The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Western Hemisphere Programs (INL/WHP), is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. The Mexico program builds on efforts begun under the Merida Initiative, with a shift away from expensive equipment and towards supporting the Mexican government's institutional reforms and strengthening the Rule of Law. The Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) Office in the Embassy in Mexico City manages the Merida Initiative program funded through the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account and destined for Mexico. <br /><br />INCLE-funded Merida Initiative assistance to Mexico's justice sector began in FY2009. This activity complements the Mexican government's much greater investment in promoting rule of law, providing for citizen security and reforming state institutions towards greater transparency, responsiveness, and respect for human rights and expanded efforts at state and local institutions. It also complements activities funded by USAID's Economic Support Fund in the areas of security, rule of law, and community development. The goal of this program is to institutionalize justice sector reforms to sustain the rule of law and respect human rights through continued institution building projects with security and justice sector organizations at the federal and state levels.</p>
<p>In 2008, Mexico passed a constitutional amendment mandating nation-wide justice sector reform by 2016. The amendment calls for implementation of an oral/adversarial criminal justice system. Mexico's transition in its criminal justice system, albeit an uneven process to date, provides a potentially important window of opportunity for fundamental reform of the criminal justice system, particularly by making the system more accountable and transparent thereby improving its public image for fairness and effectiveness. While the main emphasis of Merida Rule of Law programs has been on supporting Mexico's transition to an oral/adversarial criminal justice system on both the state and federal level, it is also important for Rule of Law programs to address weaknesses in justice sector administration, autonomy, and institutional capabilities.</p>
<p>Rule of law assistance is a core component of the USG contribution to stability and reconstruction operations worldwide. INL currently manages criminal justice policy and programs in many international locations and oversees over 1,000 personnel deployed in the field to implement these programs.</p>
<p>Purpose: <br />The Justice Advisor will support, assist, and advise INL and the U.S. Embassy in Mexico in their efforts to help Mexico to reform and otherwise establish a more effective criminal justice system and transition to the accusatorial legal system. Besides managing training and mentoring projects and administering equipment procurement supporting Mexican prosecutors, judges, investigators and forensics experts, the Justice Advisor will also liaise with, and coordinate, the activities of USG agency implementers in the justice sector reform area. The Justice Advisor will play a lead role in shaping and strategizing programs for $150 million in future assistance to the Government of Mexico.</p>
<p>The Justice Advisor may lead one or more Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs) that assist NAS MEXICO on the full range of criminal justice issues with focus on four strategic areas: disrupting the capacity of the organized criminals to operate; institutionalizing the rule of law; creating a 21st Century border; and building strong and resilient communities. S/he would play a key role in contingency planning and development of future NAS MEXICO activities in the justice sector. S/he would also serve as a resource for other SMS program managers, providing expert guidance to assist in implementing, monitoring and evaluating U.S. foreign policy directives regarding the development of criminal justice sector reform projects managed by NAS Mexico.</p>
<p>The Justice Advisor frequently meets with members of other U.S. Government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and international community for the purpose of gathering and disseminating information pertinent to justice sector development and USG priorities and activities.</p>
<p>The Justice Advisor will be expected to know or master the full range of assistance project management skills, including planning, budgeting, procurement, contracting, and monitoring and evaluation. The Justice Advisor is frequently called upon to perform other tasks or duties on an ad hoc basis, particularly those requiring strong drafting skills or legal analysis.</p>
<p>Relationship: <br />The Justice Advisor reports to the Senior Program Officer covering Rule of Law projects, and oversees the work of the Assistant Justice Advisor.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities: <br />a. Serve as the senior Rule of Law expert within NAS MEXICO.<br />b. Provide to NAS and Embassy front offices, analysis of trends and developments in the areas of judicial reform and rule of law. <br />c. Conduct assessments of judicial and security agencies and institutions and their training academies and facilities. <br />d. Develop program designs, performance monitoring plans, and evaluation planning for projects in support of judicial reform and improving the rule of law. <br />e. Coordinate all NAS interagency efforts with DOJ and USAID to include special investigative units, major crimes task forces, judicial training, financial crimes, and arms trafficking. <br />f. Oversee NAS funding of other agencies involved in projects in forensics, money laundering, and trafficking in persons and arms. <br />g. Serve as Embassy Executive Secretary for Arms Trafficking and Money Laundering Working Groups. <br />h. Draft policy and advocacy papers, attend meetings and conferences. Facilitate exchange of information and practices to ensure robust communication on rule of law issues within NAS, as well as with other professionals working in area of Rule of Law in Mexico. <br />i. Prepare background materials and reports to be used by NAS MEXICO Director and other US Consulate officials in preparing speeches, briefings, and testimonies to articulate NAS MEXICO engagement on Rule of Law issues with the mission. <br />j. Participate in outreach activities with domestic and international legal communities to increase awareness of INL programs/ policies and solicit greater cooperation and participation. <br />k. Perform other duties as requested and assigned by the NAS MEXICO Senior Program Officer responsible for Rule of Law programs.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT - Auto Parts Supply Concession</p>
<p>Solicitation action for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.303, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP). This is an unrestricted (full &amp; open)request for proposal with a North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) of 336399 - All Other Motor Vehicle Parts Manufacturing and shall remain open for responsible sources to respond. Contractors are required to identify their company's business size.</p>
<p>The US Customs and Border Protection Agency intends to establish a single Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to fulfill this requirement; however, the Government reserves the right to not award any BPA and does not guarantee any order placements. The resultant BPA award will be five (5) years in duration with an aggregate total Not-To-Exceed ceiling amount of $2.2 million. The fixed price per unit will be determined based on a breakdown of all costs and delivery to locations indicated. The Government anticipates award of a BPA within 150 days of receipt of proposals. The Government is obligated only to the extent of the authorized purchases made under the BPA.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF AGREEMENT - Supplier shall furnish auto parts in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Attachment 2, and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP), Attachment 3, during a five (5) year specified period to the Department of Homeland Security, US Customs and Border Protection Agency, Office of Border Patrol Headquarters, Tucson Sector (Tucson Sector OBP), at the locations as provided in Section IV below. Requirements shall be furnished if and when requested by the Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR)acting within their scope of delegated procurement authority.</p>
<p>SECTION I: Requirement Information</p>
<p>Primary Requisitioning Office for this BPA:<br />US Customs and Border Protection Agency<br />US Border Patrol, Tucson Sector Headquarters<br />2430 South Swan Blvd<br />Tucson AZ 85711</p>
<p>SECTION II: Purpose</p>
<p>Product, Service, or Outcome Needed:</p>
<p>Tucson Sector OBP and its organizational components seek to establish an on-site auto parts concession service for the vehicle maintenance program to increase the efficiency and performance of the fleet management and maintenance program. Currently, there is no automated<br />method to connect the parts purchase for a vehicle thru SAP and the current Fleet Tool Program. Establishing an on-site auto parts concession utilizing the Vehicle Management Information System will allow the Sector Fleet Operations Branch to account and track the<br />maintenance charges, labor and time for individual vehicles.</p>
<p><br />In the spirit of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, the US Customs and Border Protection intends to enter into a single award agreement to further reduce the administrative costs of acquiring auto parts.</p>
<p>BPA's eliminate contracting and open market costs such as: the search for sources; the development of technical documents and solicitations; and the evaluation of bids and offers. Contractor Teaming Arrangements are permitted in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).</p>
<p>This BPA will further decrease costs, reduce paperwork and save time by eliminating the need for repetitive, individual purchases from the Supplier. The end result is to create a purchasing mechanism for the Government that works better and costs less.</p>
<p>SECTION III: Background</p>
<p>The Tucson and Yuma Sectors OBP currently have garages at various locations in Southern Arizona. Through this BPA, both Tucson and Yuma Sectors OBP seek to acquire a full service in-house auto parts supply concession. This concession would supply a full range of auto parts supplies to support the sector's automotive parts requirements for the sector's Fleet vehicles. The concession would be fully staffed at operating locations throughout the sector, staffed by the vendor and have the capability to operate on a flexible schedule to accommodate the maintenance work flow. The concession must also have the ability to process all purchases utilizing credit cards that are in use by CBP and DHS.</p>

The new version shall be referred to as Version 2.0. This shall include the source code and all project files associated with the program. The source code as delivered must compile to the executable. The delivered software shall be based on the CITE-AHU.exe software. The structure of the software shall be modular to facilitate functional updates and future expansions. The contractor may note that some procedures may be structured more efficiently in Visual C++ (or other approved language) than in the original Visual Basic code. NIST would strongly prefer C++, but other languages that would be considered, in preferred order, would be C# (C Sharp), Visual Basic 2010 (VB 10.0), and Visual Basic 2008 (VB 9.0). Note that the requirement for Visual Studio 2010 or 2008 applies to all languages. The contractor shall implement the code in the most efficient way. Note that the intent is to preserve and/or improve the functionality of the code, not to perform a line-by-line translation. <br /><br />The end software provided by the contractor shall provide the capability for analysis of multiple pieces of equipment in a building or network of buildings.<br />The software shall be able to reliably perform the data pre-processing and analysis for single-duct air-handling units, provide new graphing capabilities, and be designed and documented in a manner that would facilitate the future expansion to include analysis for other types of mechanical equipment i.e., chillers, variable air volume boxes, dual-duct air handling units, etc.<br />The objective is for the contractor to provide a tool to serve the target users: (1) commissioning agents performing tasks to verify correct installation and operation, and (2) building operators/ energy managers who want to monitor performance of multiple AHUs on an ongoing basis, performing seasonal pre-functional checks. CITE-AHU aids building operators in decision-making by analyzing data collected from the building energy management system (BEMS) and evaluated using a set of expert rules governing the proper operation of the mechanical equipment. <br /><br />The new commissioning software must be capable of:<br />&bull; Storing and analyzing data files containing several thousand records,<br />&bull; Analyzing and pre-processing data collected from a building energy management system,<br />&bull; Detecting faults in installations by applying expert rules,<br />&bull; Presenting results simplified in the forms of graphs and tables,<br />&bull; Providing a written diagnosis report that lists possible causes of each fault detected and presenting them in a hierarchically organized format.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS ACQUISITION IS BEING PROCURED UTILIZING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.<br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519, with size standard of $25.5M.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being procured as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Enterprise Systems Division (ESD) of the Office of Information Systems Management (OISM) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) project to provide the ability to host applications, servers, and storage space and provide access to these resources. NIST is seeking to obtain Government Community Cloud services that will provide an on-demand, self-service IaaS offering to NIST OISM's customers. The goal is to establish consolidated and integrated public service delivery capability for Development/Testing that will streamline the implementation and support of NIST websites, virtual machines, and applications to the Public Cloud.<br />The project objectives include:<br />&bull; Identify the challenges presented in implementing/offering private, public, and hybrid cloud-based IaaS capabilities in NIST's environment <br />&bull; Identify chargeback, network, and security strategies for an on-demand self-service infrastructure<br />&bull; Identify cloud platform virtualization layer requirements <br />&bull; Identify cloud management layer requirements<br />&bull; Identify the challenges in migrating virtual servers among on-premise and off-premise IaaS providers<br />&bull; Understand interoperability between NIST Private cloud and provider's community cloud <br />&bull; Increase OISM expertise in Cloud Computing deployment models <br />&bull; Develop an architectural design for an OISM IaaS cloud</p>
<p>Brand Name Justification</p>
<p>AWS is a Cloud Service Provider offering cloud storage and virtual machine services in a Government Community Cloud. AWS is the largest commercial entity with a dedicated focus on Cloud Storage and Virtual Machine and is positioned as the dominant market leader.</p>
<p>NIST is in need of a Government Cloud environment that contains all required security, service delivery and hosting capabilities necessary to effectively support the development, and testing needs of NIST. With AWS, NIST can requisition compute, storage, and other services on demand, gaining access to a suite of secure, scalable, and flexible IT infrastructure services as needed. AWS provides cloud services a pay-as-you-go model, delivering access to technology resources that are managed by experts. Access to AWS services are provided over the internet, with no upfront costs, and NIST pays only for the computing resources that are consumed.</p>
<p>AWS GovCloud is designed to allow US government agencies to move more sensitive workloads into the cloud by addressing their specific regulatory and compliance requirements. In addition, NIST is piloting IaaS using the Eucalyptus platform which is very compatible with AWS services allowing NIST to test interoperability scenarios in a hybrid environment.</p>
<p>The AWS GovCloud is uniquely positioned with a dedicated focus on Cloud Storage, Virtual Machines, and secure environment to provide scalable cost-efficient solutions for NIST to complete our IaaS pilot project to discover how cloud services can help our scientists reduce costs, drive efficiencies, and increase innovation. The AWS solution is only available from limited authorized government partners as designated by AWS.</p>

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

https://www.sam.gov" <BR> <BR>(a) Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote. 
(b) QUOTE PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS The quotation shall consist of two parts: (1) technical submission and (2) price information. 
Technical Acceptability - The technical proposal shall consist of descriptive information (including equipment drawing and complete specifications) regarding the items identified in the solicitation. This information may include product literature or other narrative describing the products to be provided. The information provided should be presented in such a manner as to enable the Government to make a thorough and complete evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the products proposed and described will satisfy the requirements of the Government as stated in the solicitation. 
EVALUATION OF QUOTES Selection of a vendor for award will be based on two parts, as follows: 
(1) Technical Acceptability: The technical information submitted by each offeror will be evaluated against the specifications provided in the solicitation line item description, INSTRUCTIONS TO QUOTERS, and EVALUATION OF QUOTES and determined to either pass or fail. If the technical proposal is determined "fail", it renders the entire proposal technically unacceptable. If a technical rating of "fail" is assigned, the vendor may no longer be considered for award. The Contracting Officer will evaluate products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. 
(2) Price - The vendor's proposed prices will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness. 
The PCO will review all of the proposals. Upon completion of the above, a single award for all items will be made to the offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is considered technically acceptable, i.e. received a "pass" evaluation for Technical Acceptability and whose offer is considered to be the lowest price. (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of clause) <BR> <BR>Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation  by Jan 17, 2013 12:00 pm. Questions not received within the time period given may not be considered. <BR> <BR>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>
<p>52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause- <br />"Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. <br />"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities. <br />"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. <br />"Registered in the CCR database" means that- <br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14) into the CCR database; and <br />(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. <br />(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. <br />(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. <br />(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. <br />(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- <br />(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or <br />(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. <br />(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: <br />(i) Company legal business. <br />(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. <br />(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and ZIP Code. <br />(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and ZIP Code (if separate from physical). <br />(v) Company Telephone Number. <br />(vi) Date the company was started. <br />(vii) Number of employees at your location. <br />(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. <br />(ix) Line of business (industry). <br />(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). <br />(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. <br />(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. <br />(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(g) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

Award will be made on the basis of the Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote.  All quotes will be evaluated and considered for contract award.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: <br>  <br> Subfactor 1: Capable of calibrate and repair all Test Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) in accordance with the manufacturer suggested tolerances. <br>  <br> Subfactor 2: Capable of testing equipment needs to be traceable to the National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST). <br>  <br> Subfactor 3: Provide calibration documentation on each piece of test equipment calibrated. <br>  <br> Subfactor 4. System for Award Management (SAM). Have a current registration in the SAM with updated DUNS and CAGE numbers. <br>  <br> Subfactor 5. Government Purchase Card (GPC).  Confirm that your firm will accept the US Government Purchase Card as method of payment. <br>  <br> Evaluation Standards:  The Government will use the following standards to rate Technical:  <br> (1) Acceptable - Quotation clearly meets the minimum requirements of the quotation <br> (2)  Unacceptable - Quotation does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the quotation   <br>  <br> FACTOR 2: PRICE. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness based on anticipated adequate price competition.  Price will not be rated. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes only by adding the total price for all option years to the total price for the base year.  Once the technical subfactors are rated as acceptable, award will be made to the technically acceptable quoter with the lowest price. <br>  <br> The Government intends to make an award without conducting discussions.  After the initial evaluation of quotations is completed, if one or more quotations are rated Acceptable for Technical Acceptance, the initial evaluation will become the final evaluation of quotations and award will be made without discussions to the lowest priced quoter.  If any technical subfactor is rated Unacceptable after the initial evaluation, the technical factor will be rated Unacceptable and the quotation will no longer be considered for award.  If all quotations submitted result in an unacceptable technical evaluation then clarifications may be necessary.  The Government evaluation team will evaluate the quoter's response to the Government exchanges with quoters. <br>  <br> (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in blanket purchase agreement without further action by either party. Before quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br>  <br>  (End of provision) <br> 	 <br> 		 <br> 		 <br>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

 E.2  	FAR 52.209-5  CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)
 
   (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -
 
       (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -
 
         (A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
         (B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:  commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);
 
         (C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and
 
         (D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
           (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
             (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
             (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
           (2) Examples.
 
             (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
             (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
             (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
             (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
             (ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.
 
     (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).
 
   THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.
 
   (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
 
   (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation.  However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility.  Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.
 
   (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision.  The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
 
   (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.  If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is currently organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.  In addition to DRM, PS, and OPS, OFDA has a Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Within OFDA, the Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement (HPGE) Team serves as the principle focal point for humanitarian policy development, engagement with UN agencies and other public international organizations, and other donor governments. The HPGE Team tracks trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field; engages in policy discussion with other donors and multilateral agencies; recommends strategies for action; initiates policy and internal guidance for the organization; maintains global relationships with OFDA implementing partners and other donors; leads OFDA's communications work; and serves as the primary interlocutor with OFDA's other federal partners on global issues. The HPGE Team is directed by a Humanitarian Coordination Specialist, and supported by a Humanitarian Policy Advisor, an Operations Support Coordinator, and has staff focused on program development, policy and outreach, strategic communications, and interagency engagement. The HPGE Team also has Humanitarian Advisors located in Rome, Geneva, and New York.  The Communications and Outreach Specialist (COS) is part of the Strategic Communications Team.</p>
<p>The COS's primary responsibility would be to lead and guide consultations within HPGE to clearly define communications objectives based on: a) different elements of the portfolio, including strategic initiatives, global programming, and policy efforts, and b) different venues and fora that OFDA staff participates in.  Other responsibilities include development of effective communications products and vehicles to reach defined objectives.  Such efforts should raise awareness and increase understanding of HPGE's projects and convey the impacts of the Team's work on other parts of OFDA.  The COS should effectively communicate OFDA's humanitarian policy positions and strategic direction.</p>
<p>The COS will work closely with the HPGE Director and OFDA Strategic Communications Team Lead.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To obtain the services of a COS to develop effective communications products and vehicles to reach defined objectives of OFDA's Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The COS's portfolio will include communications and outreach support on the following:</p>
<p>Strategic Initiatives:  Donor and partner relationships and outreach.</p>
<p>Global Programs:  Analysis of humanitarian assistance architecture and response efforts through financial support to UN agencies, NGOs, academia, and research institutions.</p>
<p>Policy Efforts:  UN humanitarian resolutions, humanitarian reform initiatives, and best-practice development and dissemination.</p>
<p>Audiences will range from internal OFDA, internal USAID, and internal USG, to external groups such as UN humanitarian agencies, humanitarian consortia, academia, and think tanks.</p>
<p>Communications vehicles will include but not be limited to newsletters, speeches, briefing papers, website content, and presentations.  The COS will be responsible for developing additional, innovative tools to reach communications objectives</p>
<p>The COS's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop and oversee implementation of HPGE communications strategy after analyzing the needs of different audiences and defining team's communications objectives.  Likely components of strategy will be, informative and general education products about HPGE; analytical and evaluative policy updates; and strategic communications such as position papers and briefing papers to achieve specific outcomes, such as position harmonization with other donors.</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop and manage internal communications channels through which to relay timely updates on HPGE's policy initiatives and engagement efforts.  Products such as newsletters should keep the office informed of successes in the portfolio and broader impacts on the office.</p>
<p>&bull;	Seek public speaking outreach opportunities for OFDA staff and provide support for staff who get requests.  Track and provide analysis of public outreach engagements to ensure such efforts are strategic and effective.  Coordinate OFDA public speaker training to ensure staff has the tools to give dynamic presentations and convey OFDA's mission.</p>
<p>&bull;	Coordinate all HPGE communications to ensure high standards are maintained and key messages are well understood and presented to all audiences.</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor developments within USG and internationally that are relevant to HPGE's strategic areas of interest.  Produce topical reports and analysis for team, other parts of OFDA, DCHA, and other stakeholders as needed via defined channels.  Selected candidate must participate in relevant internal USG and external meetings in order to write effectively about these topics.  Selected candidate must develop comprehensive knowledge of other USG offices involved in humanitarian assistance, such as the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration and Bureau of International Organization Affairs.</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop and execute official communications such as memos, cables, speeches, and briefing papers on humanitarian policy for OFDA and DCHA principals, as well as the Administrator's office.  Type and content of product will depend on nature of event, audience, and strategic objective as identified by principal or HPGE.</p>
<p>&bull;	Remain in regular contact with appropriate DCHA Front Office staff to coordinate communications efforts and ensure adherence to official messaging.</p>
<p>&bull;	Liaise with other parts of OFDA to ensure HPGE communications are representative of OFDA's overall efforts and strategic direction, i.e., the big picture is captured effectively, when appropriate.</p>
<p>&bull;	Related to above, write accurately and effectively about humanitarian operations and policy areas which may not explicitly fall under HPGE's purview. These areas could include, inter alia, disaster risk reduction, internal displacement, and protection.  Selected candidate must develop comprehensive knowledge of OFDA and the rest of DCHA.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide contributions to other USAID and external publications.</p>
<p>&bull;	Work with press officers to develop policy and engagement pages on the OFDA and USAID websites.</p>
<p>&bull;	Work with other HPGE staff to develop humanitarian policy and global engagement training for OFDA staff and USG.</p>
<p>Administrative and Other General Duties and Responsibilities will include:</p>
<p>&bull;	Participate in the preparation of memoranda and briefing papers where input from the Office of the Director is required.</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in any follow-up actions regarding ongoing and current emergency programs.</p>
<p>&bull;	Draft routine responses to partner or staff inquiries and participate in making  <br /> recommendations to resolve issues, as appropriate.</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as a member of the Washington-based RMT, which provides services and<br /> support to DARTs deployed in response to disasters. The duties on the Washington<br /> RMT will be varied.</p>
<p>&bull;	On occasion, serve as OFDA Duty Officer.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:</p>
<p>The Communications Outreach Specialist works under the supervision of and reports directly to the HPGE Director and OFDA Communications Team Lead, or his/her designee. He/she will be expected to coordinate closely with other members of the HPGE Team.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:</p>
<p>The incumbent will gradually be expected to take initiative, act independently within the larger team parameters, and perform with moderate to minimal direction from the Humanitarian Coordination Specialist in the performance of his/her duties.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>ADDENDA TO 52.212-1 PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: (A) To assume timely and equitable evaluation of the proposal, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein. The proposal must be complete, self-sufficient, and respond directly to the requirements of this solicitation. Offerors must submit with their offers: 1) Pricing Proposal/Schedule, Specific Instructions are as follows: (1) PART I - PRICE PROPOSAL - Submit original. (a) Complete the attached Pricing Schedule (Attachment 2). The provisions FAR 52.212-3 shall be returned along with the proposal. (2) PART 2 - TECHNICAL PROPOSAL - The contractor must provide a resume showing they are capable of meeting the requirements in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS, Attachment 1). Please limit pages to 1-2. The Government reserves the right to interview the applicant before award. Technical evaluation will be conducted on an acceptable/unacceptable basis using the ratings described in table A-1.</p>
<p>Table A-1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum<br />requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum<br />requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(3) PART III - PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION- Only references for same or similar type contracts as desired. Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis using the ratings in table A-2.</p>
<p>Table A-2. Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom<br />information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past<br />performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price, Technical, and Past Performance.</p>
<p>After receipt of proposals, the proposals will be ranked by price before the Government assesses technical capability. Offers will be evaluated based on total price. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise option(s). If the lowest priced offer is determined to be acceptable for Technical and Past Performance, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to be acceptable for Technical or Past Performance, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is determined to be acceptable for Technical and Past Performance, or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold. The contracting officer shall indicate whether electronic submissions of quotations will be accepted. Paragraph (b)(4) of provision 1352.213?71 may be tailored based on the evaluation factors. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.302?1?70, insert the following provision: Instructions for Submitting Quotations Under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial (Date) (a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard.

(5) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and reference information (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information). (6) Price and any supporting details for the price, as requested in the solicitation. (c) Offerors are responsible for submitting quotations, and any modifications thereto, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified.

The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest quotation; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations received. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.

<p>This requirement is for the upgrade and repair of 109 B.E. Meyers MOUT/Tracker camera assemblies.</p>
<p>A.2 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Government's facility contains 109 MOUT/Tracker Cameras manufactured by B.E. Meyers. The cameras contain a daytime color camera and a no light black and white camera that utilizes an infrared illuminator. The camera assembly detects light levels and automatically energizes the IR illuminator and the night time camera when light levels are reduced. The illuminators installed in the cameras are set to a bandwidth that is not visible with MIL SPEC night vision goggles. The cameras were installed in 2006 and are in need of a circuit board upgrade and miscellaneous repairs to extend their life cycle.</p>
<p>A.3 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to purchase, design, fabricate, install, and test a circuit board upgrade in 109 B.E. Meyers MOUT/Tracker cameras. Evaluate IR illuminator output. Evaluate cameras for other needed repairs and complete authorized repairs.</p>

<p>B.1.1 The Government shall ship the cameras to the contractor in increments of 20. The final increment may be less than 20.</p>
<p>B.1.2 The contractor shall evaluate the camera to determine if it is cost feasible to upgrade the main control board. If a camera has repairs (excluding the control board upgrade) totaling more than 33% of the cost for a new camera, the contractor shall not install a main control board and deem the camera as "not repairable". The Government considers the 33% threshold to be $1400.00.</p>
<p>B.1.3 Any diagnostic fee charged by the contractor shall be applied to camera upgrades and repairs. If the camera was deemed non-repairable the contractor shall be entitled to a predetermined fee for diagnostics.</p>
<p>B.1.4 The contractor shall purchase, design, fabricate, install, and test an upgraded main control board in 109 MOUT/Tracker cameras, or a quantity equal to those deemed "repairable" in item B.1.2. The upgraded board shall incorporate a heat sink on the main board and correct deficiencies identified in the original design. The circuit board shall be compatible with other components in the camera and not affect its normal operating parameters.</p>
<p>B.1.5 If the contractor fails to identify repairs that exceed the 33% threshold prior to installing the main control board the contractor shall complete those repairs at its own expense.</p>
<p>B.1.6 The contractor shall ship cameras to the Government upon completion of the main control board upgrade, unless other repairs are pending. Cameras deemed non-repairable can be utilized for parts to repair other cameras. The contractor shall not invoice for parts removed from non-repairable cameras. All non-repairable cameras/parts shall be returned to the Government upon the completion of the upgrade and repair of all cameras.</p>
<p>B.2 CAMERA REPAIRS</p>
<p>B.2.1 The contractor shall provide a written report via email, in PDF format, itemizing the repairs for each group of twenty cameras. Report shall identify cameras by serial number.</p>

<p>B.2.3 Upon authorization by DESIGNATED Government personnel, the contractor shall repair specified cameras. The Government intends to complete all repairs that do not exceed 33% of the replacement cost for a new camera.</p>
<p>B.2.4 If the contractor initiates repairs and then discovers repairs it failed to identify in the report, which cause the 33% threshold to be exceeded, the contractor shall complete those repairs at its own expense.</p>
<p>B.2.5 Upon completion of repairs for each increment of 20 the contractor shall ship cameras to the Government.</p>
<p>B.2.6 The Government will continue to ship cameras in increments of 20 as it receives repaired units back from the contractor.</p>
<p>B.2.7 The contractor shall ship all non-repairable cameras and parts to the Government upon completion of camera upgrades and repairs.</p>
<p>B.3 CAMERA UPGRADE AND REPAIR</p>
<p>B.3.1 The MOUT/Tracker Camera is designed and manufactured by B.E. Meyers and contains proprietary design features. The contractor completing repairs and upgrades shall not modify the camera housing or dimensions. The contractor shall be an authorized B.E. Meyers service provider. Installed parts must return the cameras to within their original operating specifications and capabilities.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<DESC><p><strong>**THE RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN UPDATED TO 21 DECEMBER 2012**</strong></p>
<p>No other changes have been made.<br /><br />This Request for Information is identical to N68335-13-RFI-7101 which has been simultaneously posted under PSC Code 62 (Lighting Fixtures and Lamps).</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. It shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract as a result of this request for information.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst NJ (NAWCADLKE) is requesting comments from industry on the DRAFT Statement of Work and Specification currently being developed to successfully design, develop, integrate, test, qualify, and produce a Sustainment Lighting System (SLS) for the United States Marine Corps. Information provided in response to this RFI will be used by the government in the development of its acquisition strategy and refinement of the SLS system specification.</p>
<p>The mission of the NAVAIR EAF Program is to provide the Marine Corps with the equipment necessary to support the rapid deployment and establishment of self-sustaining airfields in austere, expeditionary operating environments with a minimum of infrastructure. This capability is achieved through the installation of one or more EAF subsystems, which include airfield surfacing systems, expeditionary arresting gear, terminal guidance systems and airfield lighting and marking systems. Headquarters Marine Corps has identified the need to replace legacy EAF airfield lighting systems in order to increase operational capability. Presently fielded EAF airfield lighting systems are not capable of supporting runway operations in Category I (CAT I) Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) meteorological conditions, and a need exists to improve compatibility with Night Vision Devices (NVD) at both runways and Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) sites.</p>
<p>The SLS shall be comprised of two individual, but interoperable, airfield lighting modules to appropriately scope the capability and optimize the equipment necessary to meet the diverse operating needs of Marine Aviation during deployments and at garrison training sites. These two modules and their contents are described as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; VTOL Module shall provide the components necessary to support nighttime vertical lift aircraft operating in Visual Flight Rules (VFR) meteorological conditions at remote sites and within an airfield complex without the need for an external power interface. The VTOL Module consists of edge lighting, wind indication and controllers (both portable and pilot-activated).</p>
<p>&bull; Runway Module shall provide the components necessary to define the operating surface of a 6,000 foot long bi-directional runway and its associated taxiways, in addition to providing visual approach aids, wind cones, informational lighting and signage, and controllers. The Runway Module shall provide additional runway edge lighting and associated cabling and hardware to expand the runway by up to 2000 feet in length as a separate package. The composition of components must allow for system installations to be scaled for different airfield dimensions and for the ability to continue aircraft launch and recovery operations as meteorological conditions degrade. The Runway Module shall include three approach light systems in order to support runway operations in VFR, Non-Precision IFR, and CAT I IFR meteorological conditions, as defined by the Marine Corps below:</p>
<p>VFR 1000 foot ceiling, 3 statute mile visibility<br />Non-Precision IFR 250 foot ceiling, &frac34; statute mile visibility<br />CAT I Precision IFR 200 foot ceiling, &frac12; statute mile visibility</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Detailed system performance parameters are provided in the supporting draft System Specification and draft Statement of Work. Comments and feedback related to these documents are welcomed and all questions will be responded to in an anonymous fashion through further postings against this synopsis.</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI should consider the suggested page limitations of 1 written page, 12 point font, per bulleted item below. Brochures, pamphlets and other marketing or sales media should not be provided in response to this RFI. Respondents to this RFI should ensure that the following areas are addressed:</p>
<p>&bull; Interoperability and control issues arising from the use of products from multiple sources.<br />&bull; Approach to obsolescence mitigation for critical technologies, e.g. LED, batteries.<br />&bull; Application of Open Architecture in order to minimize issues with redesign during the system's life cycle.<br />&bull; Software approach to allow for Government support of system software over the system's life cycle.<br />&bull; Experience with software development and company CMMI certification<br />&bull; Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the solutions provided in response to this RFI.<br />&bull; Ease of upgrade/compatibility with third party hardware.<br />&bull; Maximum design flexibility directed at future competitive procurements.<br />&bull; Obstacles to meeting any area within the SOW or Specification.<br />&bull; Level of development required to meet any area within the SOW or Specification.<br />&bull; Identify technical risk areas.<br />&bull; Provide a notional schedule to accomplish tasks outlined in SOW/Specification.</p>
<p>Material identified as Company Proprietary provided in response to this RFI will be treated as such by the government. Any interested parties must contact Michelle Prinston at michelle.prinston@navy.mil to request a copy of the Statement of Work and Specification.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication that the PMA-251 Program Office or NAVAIR will contract for the items contained in the RFI. NAVAIR will not pay respondents for any information generated for or provided in response to this RFI. The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any costs associated with the information submitted in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside of the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.</p>

<DESC><p>Updated information for this notice is provided in bold below:<br /><br /><strong>The following additonal information is requested. Only responses pertaining to the specific request below shall be entertained.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />System Spec 3.2.1.2.1.1, 3.2.1.2.1.2 </strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiple Vendors raised Concern about Heat issue for VTOL and Taxiway Lights. SLS team would like vendors to provide a description of the level of engineering effort and Rough Order of Magnitude Cost estimate for the vendor to develop heat resistant VTOL and Taxiway lights. Vendors may provide any discussion, data or examples of any prior heat resistant work that may lower the overall developmental risk, in addition to presumed, anticipated, or previously known failure modes.</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>The following questions and answers are provided:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />System Spec 3.1.1 (VTOL Module Description)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:<br />From the text it can be understood that the area of VTOL can be less than 100 square feet while it's probably an area 100x100 feet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />EAF VTOL site dimensions are stated in paragraph 3.1.1. The term "100 feet square" is used to signify a site that is 100 feet long on each edge (100 feet by 100 feet), and it is understood that this phrasing will be clarified in future revisions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />System Spec 3.2.1.4.1.1 (Provide PAPI)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:<br />In requirement q. it is stated the flashing requirement. We suggest that the IR flashing sector of the PAPI units should be synchronized among them to produce a clear indication to the pilot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />Suggestion is understood. Synchronized flashing has not been identified as a requirement at this time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />System Spec 3.2.1.4.1.1 (Provide PAPI), 3.2.1.4.2.1 (Provide REIL), 3.2.1.4.2.2 (Provide ODAL)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:<br />For the synchronization of the flashing lights among the lighting units of a group, a reference trigger signal is presumably utilized. This signal is typically transmitted continuously during the operation, to maintain the timing. In order to avoid the susceptibility of the system's operation versus electromagnetic disturbances or jamming, it could be considered a requirement to provide a continuous synchronization method (after the initial one) that is not continuously transmitted by radio. Synchronized units by cable signal is an example of such method.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />Comment is understood. While wireless control of the noted sub-systems is a requirement, wireless synchronization of flashing components within a sub-system is not a stated requirement nor to be implied. This response also applies to paragraph 3.2.1.4.2.3: "Provide MALSR".</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />System Spec 3.2.1.7 (Packaging)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:<br />From SS 3.2.1.7 it is understood that the system shall provide the capability to packaged as a component and by function in a container and also, for the battery powered units, to<br />charged in storage. It's not completely clear if the packaging structures of the units/functions with those capabilities is part of the scope of the design and supply. Could you clarify that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />Packaging and packaging-related functions (e.g. battery charging) is included within the scope of this effort.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />Not Specified</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:<br />The power distribution requirement is simply stated that the runway module will distribute power to support airfield lighting modules not supported by a battery. This specification needs further development. Will this require use of only USMC provided generators? Local power?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />The power sources from which the SLS is expected to operate from are defined in paragraphs 3.1.2 and 3.2.3.1.1.1.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />Not Specified</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question: <br />The power distribution system is the heart of the airfield lighting. Several more questions on this specification include but are not limited to:<br />Input voltage ranges and Frequency ranges?<br />Signs discuss being battery powered and running off of 115 VAC is this part of the power distribution for the SLS?<br />Is the power limited to known USMC/Navy Gen-sets?, does it need to be able to support other sources including Army/USAF sources, local native power sources and Gen-sets for sustained operations?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: <br />Input voltage and frequency ranges are stated in paragraph 3.2.3.1.1.1.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Signs are stated to be operable from 120 VAC as a back-up method of power only. This will be clarified in future revisions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Input sources are stated in paragraph 3.2.3.1.1.1.</strong></p>

Presently fielded EAF airfield lighting systems are not capable of supporting runway operations in Category I (CAT I) Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) meteorological conditions, and a need exists to improve compatibility with Night Vision Devices (NVD) at both runways and Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) sites.</p>
<p>The SLS shall be comprised of two individual, but interoperable, airfield lighting modules to appropriately scope the capability and optimize the equipment necessary to meet the diverse operating needs of Marine Aviation during deployments and at garrison training sites. These two modules and their contents are described as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; VTOL Module shall provide the components necessary to support nighttime vertical lift aircraft operating in Visual Flight Rules (VFR) meteorological conditions at remote sites and within an airfield complex without the need for an external power interface. The VTOL Module consists of edge lighting, wind indication and controllers (both portable and pilot-activated).</p>
<p>&bull; Runway Module shall provide the components necessary to define the operating surface of a 6,000 foot long bi-directional runway and its associated taxiways, in addition to providing visual approach aids, wind cones, informational lighting and signage, and controllers. The Runway Module shall provide additional runway edge lighting and associated cabling and hardware to expand the runway by up to 2000 feet in length as a separate package. The composition of components must allow for system installations to be scaled for different airfield dimensions and for the ability to continue aircraft launch and recovery operations as meteorological conditions degrade. The Runway Module shall include three approach light systems in order to support runway operations in VFR, Non-Precision IFR, and CAT I IFR meteorological conditions, as defined by the Marine Corps below:</p>
<p>VFR 1000 foot ceiling, 3 statute mile visibility<br />Non-Precision IFR 250 foot ceiling, &frac34; statute mile visibility<br />CAT I Precision IFR 200 foot ceiling, &frac12; statute mile visibility</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Detailed system performance parameters are provided in the supporting draft System Specification and draft Statement of Work. Comments and feedback related to these documents are welcomed and all questions will be responded to in an anonymous fashion through further postings against this synopsis.</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI should consider the suggested page limitations of 1 written page, 12 point font, per bulleted item below. Brochures, pamphlets and other marketing or sales media should not be provided in response to this RFI. Respondents to this RFI should ensure that the following areas are addressed:</p>
<p>&bull; Interoperability and control issues arising from the use of products from multiple sources.<br />&bull; Approach to obsolescence mitigation for critical technologies, e.g. LED, batteries.<br />&bull; Application of Open Architecture in order to minimize issues with redesign during the system's life cycle.<br />&bull; Software approach to allow for Government support of system software over the system's life cycle.<br />&bull; Experience with software development and company CMMI certification<br />&bull; Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the solutions provided in response to this RFI.<br />&bull; Ease of upgrade/compatibility with third party hardware.<br />&bull; Maximum design flexibility directed at future competitive procurements.<br />&bull; Obstacles to meeting any area within the SOW or Specification.<br />&bull; Level of development required to meet any area within the SOW or Specification.<br />&bull; Identify technical risk areas.<br />&bull; Provide a notional schedule to accomplish tasks outlined in SOW/Specification.</p>

<DESC><p>Updated information for this notice is provided in bold below:<br /><br /><strong>The following additonal information is requested. Only responses pertaining to the specific request below shall be entertained.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />System Spec 3.2.1.2.1.1, 3.2.1.2.1.2 </strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiple Vendors raised Concern about Heat issue for VTOL and Taxiway Lights. SLS team would like vendors to provide a description of the level of engineering effort and Rough Order of Magnitude Cost estimate for the vendor to develop heat resistant VTOL and Taxiway lights. Vendors may provide any discussion, data or examples of any prior heat resistant work that may lower the overall developmental risk, in addition to presumed, anticipated, or previously known failure modes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The following questions and answers are provided:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />System Spec 3.1.1 (VTOL Module Description)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:<br />From the text it can be understood that the area of VTOL can be less than 100 square feet while it's probably an area 100x100 feet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />EAF VTOL site dimensions are stated in paragraph 3.1.1. The term "100 feet square" is used to signify a site that is 100 feet long on each edge (100 feet by 100 feet), and it is understood that this phrasing will be clarified in future revisions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />System Spec 3.2.1.4.1.1 (Provide PAPI)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:<br />In requirement q. it is stated the flashing requirement. We suggest that the IR flashing sector of the PAPI units should be synchronized among them to produce a clear indication to the pilot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />Suggestion is understood. Synchronized flashing has not been identified as a requirement at this time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />System Spec 3.2.1.4.1.1 (Provide PAPI), 3.2.1.4.2.1 (Provide REIL), 3.2.1.4.2.2 (Provide ODAL)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:<br />For the synchronization of the flashing lights among the lighting units of a group, a reference trigger signal is presumably utilized. This signal is typically transmitted continuously during the operation, to maintain the timing. In order to avoid the susceptibility of the system's operation versus electromagnetic disturbances or jamming, it could be considered a requirement to provide a continuous synchronization method (after the initial one) that is not continuously transmitted by radio. Synchronized units by cable signal is an example of such method.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />Comment is understood. While wireless control of the noted sub-systems is a requirement, wireless synchronization of flashing components within a sub-system is not a stated requirement nor to be implied. This response also applies to paragraph 3.2.1.4.2.3: "Provide MALSR".</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />System Spec 3.2.1.7 (Packaging)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:<br />From SS 3.2.1.7 it is understood that the system shall provide the capability to packaged as a component and by function in a container and also, for the battery powered units, to<br />charged in storage. It's not completely clear if the packaging structures of the units/functions with those capabilities is part of the scope of the design and supply. Could you clarify that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />Packaging and packaging-related functions (e.g. battery charging) is included within the scope of this effort.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />Not Specified</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:<br />The power distribution requirement is simply stated that the runway module will distribute power to support airfield lighting modules not supported by a battery. This specification needs further development. Will this require use of only USMC provided generators? Local power?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />The power sources from which the SLS is expected to operate from are defined in paragraphs 3.1.2 and 3.2.3.1.1.1.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference:<br />Not Specified</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question: <br />The power distribution system is the heart of the airfield lighting. Several more questions on this specification include but are not limited to:<br />Input voltage ranges and Frequency ranges?<br />Signs discuss being battery powered and running off of 115 VAC is this part of the power distribution for the SLS?<br />Is the power limited to known USMC/Navy Gen-sets?, does it need to be able to support other sources including Army/USAF sources, local native power sources and Gen-sets for sustained operations?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: <br />Input voltage and frequency ranges are stated in paragraph 3.2.3.1.1.1.<br />Signs are stated to be operable from 120 VAC as a back-up method of power only. This will be clarified in future revisions.<br />Input sources are stated in paragraph 3.2.3.1.1.1.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>This Request for Information is identical to N68335-13-RFI-7100 which has been simultaneously posted under PSC code 17 (Aircraft launching, landing &amp; ground handling equipment.)</strong></p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. It shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract as a result of this request for information.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst NJ (NAWCADLKE) is requesting comments from industry on the DRAFT Statement of Work and Specification currently being developed to successfully design, develop, integrate, test, qualify, and produce a Sustainment Lighting System (SLS) for the United States Marine Corps.

This need is often addressed by agencies offering citizens access to applications by means of usernames and passwords. While this enables agencies to provide some online government services, it creates a burden to the citizen to manage a username and password for each agency application they need to access - as well as a costly burden on each agency to issue and manage these usernames and passwords.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, many high-value Federal applications cannot be put online because passwords do not provide a high enough level of assurance; the next generation of online government applications will require multi-factor authentication.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), signed by the President in April of 2011, seeks to help address this issue. The Strategy's vision is: "individuals and organizations utilize secure, efficient, easy-to-use, and interoperable identity solutions to access online services in a manner that promotes confidence, privacy, choice, and innovation." The NSTIC calls for Federal Agencies to be early adopters of the Identity Ecosystem envisioned in NSTIC, calling on agencies to "lead by example and implement the Identity Ecosystem for the services it provides internally and externally."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Agencies have been challenged in this to date, however, due to technical, policy and cost barriers that have made it challenging to accept third-party credential providers accredited by the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) initiative.</p>
<p>In response, the White House created a Federal Cloud Credential Exchange (FCCX) Tiger Team, co-chaired by NSTIC NPO and FICAM, which is governed by the General Services Administration (GSA). The FCCX Tiger Team consisted of a group of representatives from agencies that have a large population of external customers accessing their applications. This group was tasked with supporting the implementation of NSTIC and continuing progress to help Executive Branch Agencies align with Trust Framework Solutions (TFS) under the FICAM initiative.</p>
<p>The FCCX Tiger Team identified requirements, a technical architecture, and a set of implementation recommendations for an enterprise, cloud-based service that can provide all Federal agencies with an ability to accept the full range of FICAM-approved third-party credentials for online services for citizens. The creation of FCCX will support agencies in meeting the goals of NSTIC and FICAM, being early adopters of strong federated identity solutions, and improving security, privacy and convenience for U.S. citizens. Moreover, FCCX will enable agencies to more easily offer online a variety of citizen-facing services that are currently mired in the paper world.</p>
<p>To validate the requirements developed and gauge from industry suppliers how they might implement a privacy-enhancing, cloud-based, federated credential exchange service the FCCX Tiger Team hosted an Industry Day on August 7th, 2012 along with a request to suppliers to respond to market research questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The responses helped to further refine the requirements and implementation strategy.</p>
<p>In November, 2012, the United States Postal Service (USPS) was chosen to implement and operate a pilot version of FCCX on behalf of the Federal Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The FCCX pilot process will be led by the USPS Digital Solutions Group (DSG). The DSG was established to identify, develop and bring to market digital offerings that can enhance the value of the USPS, its products and services, and spur the growth of American commerce. In doing so, the DSG will help ensure the long term relevance and ability of the USPS to provide digital services to the citizens. The DSG operates within an innovations structure that leverages leading private sector practices and ensures effective integration with internal management, marketing and technology initiatives.<br /><br />USPS will be issuing a competitive solicitation for the FCCX pilot.&nbsp; The solicitation will be released within the&nbsp;next two&nbsp;weeks.&nbsp; The timeline will be very aggressive.&nbsp; Proposal responses will be due three weeks from solicitation issuance date.&nbsp; Supplier demonstrations/oral presentations will be scheduled in late January with contract award in February 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) seeks a contractor to develop a detailed hands on A1U maintenance troubleshooting training curriculum complete with troubleshooting instruction down to the A1U Line Replaceable Units (LRU)s for the USCG's Fleet of HC-130H aircraft. This effort requires the Contractor to develop a maintainer course for training USCG Fleet maintenance personnel for all newly installed A1U systems equipment to include training and use of maintenance procedure cards (MPCs).

<DESC>This synopsis is for the repair order N00383-13-M-036D. The order covers the repair of 4 Enclosure Assembly (NSN: 7RH 5845 013375260, P/N: 8013930) and 1 Control Sonar Projector (NSN: 7RH 5845 014118262 HT, P/N: 8130415-1). L-3 Coomunications (CAGE: 60225) is the only approved source to repair.

The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.
