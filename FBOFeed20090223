<DESC>The 950th Electronic Systems Group (950 ELSG), Hanscom AFB, MA, is issuing a Notice of Proposed Contract Action (NOCA) for the purpose of increasing the ceiling of the current contract from $9.90M to $11.77M, a total increase of $1.87M.  The current ordering period of performance of 27 June 2009 will remain unchanged.   The ceiling increase will provide continued sustainment of Airborne Broadcast Intelligence (ABI)/Combat Track II (CTII) systems to include: training, hardware/software enhancements, modifications, integration and retrofits; execution; assessment; and disposal. The contract will also have provisions for the procurement of CTII systems to include deployment, site surveys, assembly, test, integration and installation. Lastly, the contractor will be responsible for depot-level support for garrisoned and deployed hardware/software maintenance, repair and return to the user. ABI provides intelligence and tactical situational awareness to flight crews and othe! r missions of Air Mobility Command personnel. ABI provides correlated real time information from strictly off-board intelligence and tactical sources using information from the following sources: TDDS, TIBS, SIDS, and TADIL-A. ABI shows GPS-centered moving map displays of air, land, sea threats, flight paths and high definition mapping thus allowing flight crews to assess, re-route and avoid real-time threats in any location world-wide. ABI is a "snap-on" system and can be used on any aircraft that has GPS, a SATCOM antenna, and power. Combat Track II is a beyond-line-of-sight situational awareness system displaying GPS aircraft positions with IBS data overlaid on a digital moving map display. Additionally, CT II provides secure communication between participants via text messaging or through the transfer of small data files. CTII is a "snap-on" system and can be used on any aircraft that has GPS, a SATCOM antenna, and power.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORKFORTechnical Assistance to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Office of Airports (ARP) to develop and implement Safety Management System (SMS) within ARP
1.0	BACKGROUND
In November 2005, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) amended Annex 14, Volume I (Aerodrome Design and Operations), to require member states to have certificated international airports establish a Safety Management System (SMS).  The FAA supports harmonization of international standards and has worked to make U.S. aviation safety regulations consistent with ICAO standards and recommended practices.  The FAA is committed to implementing SMS throughout the agency.  The Air Traffic Organization (ATO) was the first FAA line of business (LOB) to implement SMS throughout its organization.  ARP needs to develop an SMS system for its organization.  The ARP SMS must:
a.  Apply to internal ARP processes at the Headquarters, regional offices, airport district offices and thoroughly address items delineated in this SOW.b.  Apply and integrate a formalized safety risk management process into federal actions under the purview of ARP.c.  Integrate with SMS for other FAA Lines of Business including Air Traffic    (ATO) and Aviation Safety (AVS).
Elements of SMS.The four elements of an SMS are safety policy, safety risk management, safety assurance, and safety promotion.  The elements of each are detailed below.
1.	Safety Policy - a.	Sets out what the organization is trying to achieve through its SMS.b.	Outlines the requirements, methods and processes the organization will use to achieve the desired safety outcomes.c.	Establishes senior management's commitment and expectations that the organization will incorporate and continually improve safety in all aspects of the business and business processes.  The safety policy further establishes senior management's expectation of high safety performance.d.	Reflects management's commitment to implementation procedures and processes for establishing and meeting safety objective that are measurable and attainable, and support promotion of a safety culture.2.	Safety Risk Management - a.	Safety risk management is used to assess system design and verify that it adequately controls, risk; safety risk management is integrated into applicable processes.  Validation of system performance and effectiveness of implemented risk controls and risk management strategies occurs under the safety assurance element, discussed below.  A formal safety risk management process - i.	Describes the system of interest.ii.	Identifies the hazards.iii.	Analyzes the risk.iv.	Mitigates the risk to an acceptable level.b.	Safety risk management provides for initial and continuing identification of hazards and the analysis and assessment of risk.  Appropriate risk controls or other risk management responses are developed and implemented.c.	FAA provides risk controls through activities such as the promulgation of regulations, standards, orders, directives, and policies.3.	Safety Assurance - a.	The safety assurance process continually ensures risk controls achieve their intended objectives and assesses activity to identify new hazards throughout the system life cycle.  New hazards may be those not identified during the Safety Risk Management process or those introduced by the risk controls.  This includes assessment of the need for new risk controls or to eliminate or modify risk controls that are ineffective or are no longer needed due to changes in the operational environment.  Every SMS includes a process for continuously monitoring systems of interest to assure that risk controls are being applied and working as intended as well as to identify new hazards or the need to change risk controls or other risk management responses.  These monitoring activities apply to an SMS whether the operations are accomplished internally or outsourced.b.	The safety assurance processes include - i.	Information acquisition.ii.	Analysis.iii.	System assessment.iv.	Development of preventative/corrective action for nonconformance.4.	Safety Promotion - a.	Safety promotion includes the actions taken to create an environment where safety objectives can be achieved.  The key objective is a positive safety culture, characterized by an adequate knowledge base, competency, tools, communications, training, decision making, and information sharing.  All levels of management will actively promote, and provide the leadership to ensure a positive safety culture.b.	A safety culture is the product of individual and group values, attitudes, competencies, and patterns of behavior that determine the commitment to, and the style and proficiency of, an organization's safety programs.  In the desired safety culture, people acknowledge their accountability and act on their individual responsibility for safety.  They trust, use, and rely on the organization's processes for managing safety.  The environment is characterized by good communication between management and personnel, and people continue to learn and develop through training and coaching.c.	Attributes of a positive safety culture are - i.	Competent personnel who understand hazards and associated safety risk, are properly trained, and have the skill and experience to ensure safe products/services are produced.ii.	Individual opinion is valued within the organization and personnel are encouraged to identify threats to safety and to seek the changes necessary to overcome them.iii.	An environment where people are encouraged to develop and apply their skill and knowledge to enhance safety.iv.	Processes to analyze information from employees' reports, assess their content, develop actions as necessary and communicate results to the workforce and the public.v.	Effective communications, including a non-punitive environment for reporting safety concerns.vi.	There are clear standards of behavior where there is a commonly understood difference between acceptable and unacceptable actions.vii.	Adequate resources to support the commitment to safety.viii.	A process for sharing safety information to develop and apply lessons learned with regard to hazard identification, safety risk analysis and assessment, safety risk controls, and other safety risk management responses.  Sharing of information related to corrective actions, and results of management reviews is encouraged.ix.	Safety is a core value of the organization that endures over time, even in the face of significant personnel changes at any level.x.	Willingness to recognize when basic assumptions should be challenged and changes are warranted - an adaptive and agile organization.xi.	Decisions are made based on knowing the risk involved in the consequences of the decision.

<SUBJECT>Upgrade of Existing Tystar Mini Tytan 4600; Serial Number 4301063
<SOLNBR>NB620010-9-03328
<RESPDATE>031009
<CONTACT>Jennifer Lohmeier, Phone 301-975-8173, Fax 301-975-6273, Email jennifer.lohmeier@nist.gov - Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Tystar Corporation, of Torrance, California, for the acquisition of an Upgrade of Existing Tystar Mini Tytan 4600 (Serial Number 4301063) to be used in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

Background
The NIST CNST NanoFab has a requirement to increase its Low Stress Nitride deposition capability.  Low Stress Nitride deposition is a commonly used means building Nano-Structures by our researchers.  A Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) is a process that deposits a film on devices by tightly controlling high temperature (850 degree C +/- 0.5degrees C), gas flows of Dichlorosilane and Ammonia (flows of 5cc to 200cc +/- 1cc) under vacuum conditions in a 6ft long quartz tube.  The thickness of the films ranges from a few to several hundred nanometers.  The lab’s present capability in the NanoFab consists of the existing Furnace setup that limits the usable process area of the 6ft tube to a few inches. This process is certain to become a bottleneck in the near future as the user population continues to find new applications for this film.  To remediate this, it is proposed to convert vacuum pumping capability of the system to provide larger usable area, up to 12 inches, in the 6 ft tube.  This would allow for fewer process runs with increased control over film uniformity and run to run control greatly increasing our capability/throughput.

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for the existing tool configuration to increase the usable “sweet spot” of the 6ft quartz tube to a few inches.  The required upgrade will triple or even quadruple the “sweet spot” of the process area.  If the required modifications were to be done by another vendor, Tystar would not be able to continue to provide coverage of the components or their interaction with the rest of the system.  Tystar Corporation is the only known vendor capable of providing the required upgrade.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by March 10, 2009 will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>The Framingham Heart Study - Omni Cohort
<SOLNBR>NHLBI-HC-09-18
<RESPDATE>041009
<CONTACT>Austin Sachs, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-435-0345, Fax 301-480-3430, Email sachsa@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Boston University for a six-year supplement to integrate the Omni cohort into the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) contract.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) began in 1948 as a prospective study of 5,209 men and women designed to identify factors related to coronary disease risk.  As the study progressed, it was broadened to include other cardiovascular, lung and blood diseases, and to add ancillary investigations of diseases such as cancer, sleep apnea, and osteoporosis.  In 1971, 5,124 offspring of the original cohort were added to permit examination of familial risk factors and disease patterns, and beginning in 2002 a third generation of 4,095 participants were recruited, examined, and are continuing to be followed-up for events.  For several decades, Boston University has been the contractor for the FHS to examine and follow up the Framingham Cohort, Offspring, and Third Generation participants.  The Omni cohort, consisting of minority residents of Framingham, MA, were initially recruited by FHS investigators of Boston University in 1994-1995 to complement FHS, reflecting the growing diversity of that community.  The data-gathering process from the Omni cohort was carefully designed by the FHS investigators to be as similar to that for the FHS cohort as possible. The Omni cohort was recruited, examined, and followed by the same FHS staff that performed these tasks on the FHS cohort.  Both FHS and Omni cohorts were also examined in the same facilities.  Funding for the Omni cohort thus far has been provided through NIH grants awarded to Boston University; most of these grant awards have already ended or will be ending soon.  Integrating the Omni cohort into the Boston University’s FHS contract would allow the Omni cohort participants to consistently receive the same surveillance and examination as the FHS participants.  This would make the Framingham findings more reflective of the growing diversity of the community, as FHS investigators accomplish the main objectives laid out in the recent 7-year (FY 2008 – FY 2015) FHS contract renewal: 1) To identify genetic and environmental factors related to development of cardiovascular, lung and blood diseases; 2) To identify determinants of the evolution of risk factors, subclinical and clinical manifestations of cardiovascular, lung and blood diseases; and 3) To establish and make widely available a resource for genetic and non-genetic studies of disease risk using data from candidate genes, marker and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scans, DNA, other biological specimens, and phenotype data from the participants.  The period of performance for incorporating the Omni cohort into the FHS through a contract with Boston University will be June 1, 2009 through March 31, 2015.  Omni participants will undergo an examination and will be followed regularly to ascertain the development of clinical events such as heart attack and stroke.  For the first group of Omni cohort recruited in 1994-1998, an estimated 280 of them will receive the same physical examination as that planned for the FHS Offspring cohort participants.  For the second Omni group recruited in 2003-2005, an estimated 270 of them will undergo the same physical examination currently conducted on the FHS Generation 3 participants.  After the examination, the Omni cohort (both Omni Groups 1 and 2) will be contacted regularly and followed through the end of the contract period for the development of any cardiovascular diseases.  The incumbent contractor has the unique capability to provide these required services to the NHLBI for continuation of this study.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing this project make competition unfeasible.  NOTE:  PREPARATION COSTS - This notice does not commit the Government to pay for the preparation and submission of a capabilities statement.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the NHLBI.  Interested respondents must submit, within 45 days of this announcement, written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the Omni study participants.  Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is not a request for proposals.

<CONTACT>Karen L Christian, Contract Specialist, Phone (816)426-7286, Fax (816)274-6952, Email karen.l.christian@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), and the Tropical Prediction Center/National Hurricane Center (TPC/NHC) located in Miami, FL, requires annual licensing and support for its satellite imagery ingesting system. The TPC/NHC uses Global Imaging satellite ingesting hardware and operating system. Global Imaging is a provider of remote sensing hardware and software who manufactures the GOES-EAST and GOES-WEST satellite ingest cards currently in operation at the NHC. Its proprietary GOES-EAST Ingest System Software and GOES-WEST Ingest System meet all the requirements needed by TPC/NHC. Another known source for this support would be Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC). However, for the TPC/NHC to switch to the another provider, they would have to buy new hardware and then pay for the software support on their systems. Switching to another source would require the repurchasing of both hardware and software, which would not be most advantageous to the Government given the expense already put forth. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12.101 and 13.106(b). The proposed contract action for the GOES-EAST and the GOES-WEST Ingest System Software Support at the TPC/NHC will be a base period beginning March 1, 2009 through February 28, 2010 with two 12-month option periods. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. However, all responses received within 5 calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Responses can be faxed to Karen Christian at (816) 274-6952 or sent via email to karen.l.christian@noaa.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Interested firms shall include in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications; and any additional supporting literature. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide this service. The NAICS code for this action is 541511. The Central Region Acquisitions Division requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUN). A DUN number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

This Issue Paper will be in Support of the Inorganic Arsenic Toxicological Review (Cancer Assessment).  The Statement of Work and sole source justification are attached.
No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  Any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.

All questions should be directed to Paul Dawson via email at dawson.paul@epa.gov. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

PART I - BACKGROUND
U.S. EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Program is developing a Human Health Risk Assessment to estimate cancer risk from exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs). This Human Health Risk Assessment has undergone multiple review processes including Agency Review, Interagency Review, and External Peer Review by the U.S. EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB).  Each of these reviews consistently recommended the use of epidemiological data from the Taiwanese population as reported in Chen et al. (1988, 1992) and Wu et al. (1989).  Overall these reviews have recommended the same approach for quantitative dose-response analysis as outlined by the National Research Council (2001).   These epidemiological studies have been the focus of numerous re-analyses since their publication (Lamm et al., 2006; U.S. EPA, 2005; Kayajanian et al., 2003; Lamm et al., 2003; NRC, 2001; Morales et al., 2000).   Some of these re-analyses (Lamm et al., 2006; Kayajanian et al., 2003; Lamm et al., 2003) challenge the qualitative and quantitative conclusions of the NRC (2001) and the SAB (2007). An issue paper evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of these re-analyses (Lamm et al., 2006; Kayajanian et al., 2003; Lamm et al., 2003) with emphasis on evaluation and application of their methodologies, qualitative and quantitative assumptions, and soundness of conclusions would provide useful information with respect to the current cancer assessment for iAs. Sciences International Inc. has completed substantial work on this project as a subcontractor to Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) through interagency agreement No. DW-89939822-01-0. 
PART II - JUSTIFICATION
Sciences International Inc. is considered the only source to provide the expertise required to perform the work described in this purchase order because of the following: 
(1) Sciences International Inc has completed substantial work on this project as a subcontractor to Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) through interagency agreement No. DW-89939822-01-0, entitled Review of Arsenic Related Documents. 
(2) Sciences International Inc is uniquely qualified to perform this work because it is a continuation of work that has been previously performed on an extremely complex data base with which they are intimately familiar. 
(3) Sciences International Inc has extensive experience in the preparation of technical reviews on numerous chemicals and chemical classes making Sciences International Inc highly experienced in chemical hazard assessment. Sciences International Inc has provided data collection and evaluation services in the environmental sciences for more than 16 years. 
(4) Sciences International scientists have performed hazard evaluations exposure assessments, dose response analyses and risk characterizations of environmental chemicals. (5) It would require substantially more resources (i.e. time and money) to bring another contractor to the level of expertise and experience required to conduct the precise analysis and work specified by this work assignment. No other contractors were identified with the in-depth experience and knowledge of the previous work on the critical evaluation of recent analyses of the Taiwanese epidemiological data. 
			STATEMENT OF WORKNCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES 
I. Background 
Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Technical Support for Human Health Risk Assessment and Related Activities for the Development of an Issue Paper evaluating Re-analyses of the Taiwanese Datasets for Inorganic Arsenic II. Scope of Work 
Task 1: Preparation of Work Plan and Joint Quality Management/Quality Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP) The contractor shall submit a work plan for the completion of an issue paper that evaluates recent epidemiological data and commentary/analyses with respect to conclusions of the NRC report of 2001.  A sound evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of re-analyses (Lamm et al., 2006; Kayajanian et al., 2003; Lamm et al., 2003) performed on the epidemiological data from Taiwanese populations exposed to iAs with an emphasis on evaluation and application of their methodologies, qualitative and quantitative assumptions, and soundness of conclusions with respect to the current cancer assessment for iAs will also be included.  This effort would also include a literature search to for relevant information to support the conclusions of the issue paper.  The work plan shall include the following: 
a. Description of the overall technical approach b. Level of effort c. Staffing d. Schedule for completion of tasks
EPA will review the work plan and will clarify any questions with the contractor. 
The contractor shall develop a JQM/QAPP for this project for the Technical Project Officer's and Quality Assurance staff's approval. The work plan and quality assurance statement shall be submitted simultaneously for approval. The contractor shall not perform any work under this project until the JQM/QAPP is reviewed and approved by the TPO.  The contractor must address in the JQM/QAPP how secondary data will be evaluated for use in the project.  Secondary data is environmental or health data that was developed for a different purpose.  (See Appendix A:  Requirements for Use of Secondary Data.)
Task 2: The contractor will participate in conference call to discuss any clarification to the scope of work described within the workplan.  After this conference call the contractor will proceed to develop a draft issue paper that will include, but not limited to the following:a.  Review of epidemiology studies since 2001 b.  Review of meta-analyses conducted since 2001   c.  Review of the available cancer datasets from Taiwan populations, mainly focusing on Chen et al. (1988, 1992) and Wu et al. (1989)d.  Review of all analyses existing for the Taiwanese datasets (including, but not limited to Lamm et al., 2006; NRC, 2001; Kayajanian et al., 2003; Lamm et al., 2003; Morales et al., 2000; etc.) including a comparison of the strengths and weaknesses for each analysise.  A detailed rationale of the most logical approach for analyzing the Taiwanese cancer datasets as well as presenting logical explanations of alternative analysis not chosen are inappropriate.  This detailed rationale should include a detailed account of the evidence (i.e., supporting data) supporting the conclusionsf.  Comparison of Taiwan data to other populations, including Chile and Bangladesh   g.  Discussion of the increased strength of human evidence in multiple populations since 2001      
See Appendix B for a more detailed outline of the paper. 
Upon completion of the draft document the contractor will submit to the EPA for review.
Task 3: Upon receipt of comments on the draft version of the issue paper the contractor will participate in a conference call to address any necessary clarification to the comments submitted by the EPA to the contractor.  Based upon written comments and discussions during the conference call the contractor will revise the draft issue paper. 
Task 4:  The final revised draft will then be resubmitted to the EPA within 30 days of the conference call at which time there will be an option to hold an additional conference call.  If further revisions are unnecessary, this conference call can be cancelled by the EPA PO.

<SUBJECT>Training for SSA Disability Hearing Officers 
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFQ-09-1290
<RESPDATE>022709
<CONTACT>Kevin P. Muniz, Fax 410-966-9310, Email kevin.muniz@ssa.gov
<DESC><B>VENDOR:  <U>Sole Source Synopsis to establish an Indefinite-Delivery, Requirements Contract for the planning and delivery of training related to SSA’s Disability Hearing Officer (DHO) Training requirements.</U></B>

The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a sole-source, follow-on, Indefinite-Delivery, Requirements contract to include a base year, and four 1-year option periods, if exercised, with the McGeorge School of Law for the continuation of services for the planning and delivery of training related to SSA’s HO Training requirements.  The anticipated contract will allow the incumbent to continue to provide the services for the period of performance of July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2014.  

SSA has developed and implemented a process whereby disability beneficiaries who have been notified that their disability has ceased, did not exist, or is no longer disabling are provided a face-to-face due process evidentiary hearing at the reconsideration level of SSA’s appeals process. This due process hearing, commonly referred to as a disability hearing, is generally the responsibility of the Disability Determination Specialists (DDS); however, a Federal process has been established for States that have declined the process and for cases in which the initial determination was made.  The decision maker at this face-to-face hearing is referred to as the DHO.  

BACKGROUND: On July 1, 2004, SSA awarded a five-year, Indefinite-Delivery, Requirements contract to the McGeorge School of Law for these services. McGeorge was instrumental in the initial design for the training program for SSA’s disability hearing officers (DHO’s). They have been conducting this training for SSA for over 20 years. 

REQUIREMENTS: To maintain the disability hearings process, SSA must provide for the training of non-attorney type employees involved in the disability hearing process. These hearings are conducted under the guidance of the Goldberg vs. Kelly, US Supreme Court decision that mandates how and in what manner such a hearing is to be conducted to ensure the claimant receives due process. This contract will allow SSA to continue to obtain the necessary services of a qualified contractor who can provide high quality classroom training in due process requirements. 

The responsibilities of the SSA DHO Training contractor would be: 
1) Provide a minimum of two and a maximum of 4 eight day training classes per year for a maximum of 25 trainees (the number of training classes per year is SSA’s option); 
2) Provide a 3-day “overview” class for SSA administrators once a year; 
3) Conduct training classes in a suitable facility conducive to classroom instruction with facilities for conducting mock hearings; 
4) The training facility should be connected with a law school accredited by the American Bar Association; 
5) Provide a suitably qualified and trained faculty to provide the training; 
6) The training facility will be in close proximity to establishments providing food and lodging for the trainees; 
7) The contractor will be flexible in accommodating additional training needs that may arise; 8) The contractor will present a plan for training Disability Hearing Officers, demonstrating knowledge of the SSA Continuing Disability Review (CDR) process and the Goldberg vs. Kelly requirements for due process; 
9) Provide for the use of up to 25 laptop computers for the use of trainees during the class; 
10) Maintain an electronic case bank for instruction of the trainees; 
11) Provide additional training as the need arises (such as the production of DVD training or IVT broadcast at SSA headquarters); 
12) Document all training to ensure accurate SSA performance audits; 
13) Provide a means of surveying student satisfaction with the training; and 
14) Ensure the security of all information in accordance with SSA-established requirements.

SSA will provide electronic case files for training purposes.  These case files will be purged of all personal identifiable information (PII).  The contractor must also be available to meet with SSA staff in Baltimore, Maryland for a 1-day meeting, to be briefed on the duties of the DHOs/Disability Experts (DE) and to obtain information concerning the precise goals, concepts and plans developed for the DHO course. The contractor must be able to provide all personnel, materials, supplies, and services required to support the training.

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with the McGeorge School of Law.  This contract action is pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.501(a) (1) (ii) under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes. The Government does not intend to reimburse for any information or materials submitted in response. Responses must provide sufficient information for SSA to determine that a contractor other than the McGeorge School of Law can provide the required services as described above. 

The Government will consider all responses received within five Government workdays after date of publication of the synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. The response time is five government workdays as allowed by FAR 5.203(a) (1). 

Interested sources that believe they have the capability to perform the services required, should submit a capability statement to Kevin P. Muñiz via e-mail at Kevin.muniz@ssa.gov. 
Responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENT, and shall be received no later than February 27, 2009, 4:30PM EST. All responsible sources will be considered.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date, the SSA anticipates negotiating solely with the McGeorge School of Law for the services cited above.  All questions must be submitted in writing to Kevin Muniz via the e-mail address listed above.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, federal building stewardship regulations, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values. </span><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">The Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB), renamed by Executive Order in 1999, is located in Washington DC's Presidential Park, immediately west of The White House. This National Historic Landmark (NHL) commands a unique position in both our national history and architectural heritage. Designed by Supervising Architect of the Treasury, Alfred B. Mullett, the EEOB was built between 1871-1888 to house the growing staff of the Departments of State, War, and Navy, and is considered among the best examples of French Second Empire architecture in the country. Restoration of interior building spaces began in 1983. Since then, main corridors, libraries, stairwell domes, stained glass rotundas, and certain offices have been restored. Originally known as the State, War, and Navy Building, the EEOB housed the three departments associated with formulating and conducting the nation's foreign policy in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth century - the period when the United States emerged as an international power. The building has housed many of the nation's most significant diplomats, politicians and military leaders and has been the scene of many historic events. </span><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">Due to its proximity to the White House, the EEOB houses a majority of the White House Staff offices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The building houses the Office of Management and Budget, the National Security Council, White House Counsel, and numerous other offices critical to the Presidential Administration. The EEOB is currently undergoing a 3 phased multi-year modernization and security upgrade. As the modernization's programmatic requirements evolved, it became clear that a new ADA compliant security screening facility and entrance was needed for employees, guests, and dignitaries. However, the exact size, scope, and complexity of the overall project are still under discussion and exploration. The numbers and figures described in this pre-solicitation notice are based on government estimates and projections. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>GSA realizes that these numbers are subject to change. Due to the constraints of this project, its complex environment, historic preservation requirements, and the potential impact on contributing historical resources, GSA will require the services of our nation's most talented lead designer for performance of Architect-Engineer Bridging Design Services. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architect-Engineer Bridging Design Services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">The facility will be required to meet or exceed Federal energy goals, including new standards mandated by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) and Executive Order 13423. In addition, due to the sensitive nature of the work performed by EOP OA and USSS UD, the A/E will be required to design the facility and site to meet stringent federal security requirements. The screening facility will comply with PBS P100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service), U.S. Building Codes, and U.S. Government requirements, including the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Department of Interior, Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, and associated design and landscape guidelines, as well as other applicable laws, codes, and standards. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">This is a sensitive project, therefore the offeror shall possess at time of issuance of their STAGE I SUBMITTAL packet the appropriate facility clearance and safeguarding capability necessary to perform this project in order to be considered eligible for this project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This requirement shall include, but not be limited to, holding the necessary security clearances to work within the building complex area and hold an active security clearance.

<a href="mailto:katt.kearney@us.army.mil">Aviation Applied Technology Directorate</a>
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) anticipates award of non-commercial simplified acquisitions for support of a demonstration and technical assessment of weapon systems integrated and employed on the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior under the Aviation Multi-Platform Munitions (AMPM) program. The contracts are to procure program management services, airworthiness substantiation documentation, and integration support to support a demonstration in the last quarter of Government FY 09 (July to September 2009).  It is anticipated that the Contractor will furnish weapons, special launchers and associated unique equipment. AATD will perform aircraft instrumentation and integration with Contractor support and conduct the airworthiness review.  Airworthiness substantiation documentation must be adequate to obtain a flight release for captive carry flights or live fire engagement for test purposes.  Demonstrations will be conducted at Felker Airfield, Fort Eustis, VA and/or Eglin Air Force Base, FL on a fully instrumented OH-58D Kiowa Warrior.  The Government intends to enter into discussions with Textron Defense Systems for the Sharp Shooter, Raytheon Missile Systems for the GriffinTM, Lockheed Martin Corp. Missiles and Fire Control for the Directional Attack Guided Rocket (DAGR), Alliant Techsystems Inc. for the Guided Advanced Tactical Rocket (GATR), and BAE Systems for Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS). On the basis of thorough market research, AATD personnel have concluded that the previously mentioned weapons are the only viable candidates that have sufficient technical maturity and attributes to enable demonstration of the weapons within the available test window with an already instrumented aircraft.  These weapons systems were chosen for their technological maturity and readiness for immediate integration and flight testing. The limited scope of this assessment does not permit complex modifications to the aircraft or extensive crew training for employment modes outside of conventional weapons launch mechanisms.    For these proposed actions that are under the simplified acquisition threshold and will have no options, the Government will enter into alpha negotiations with the named sources.  The contract terms and requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and the named sources consistent with alpha contracting procedures.  Accordingly, a complete solicitation will not be available. Your written request for the available requirements information (draft statement of work and data requirements) must be submitted by email request to katt.kearney@us.army.mil or lauren.sebring@us.army.mil or submitted by facsimile at (757) 878-0008.  AATD has determined that information generated in performance of these efforts is subject to export controls imposed by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.  A certified copy of DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement must be submitted with any written request.  This action is not set aside for small businesses.  Only qualified U.S. sources may participate as prime contractors.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to the procurement is 541712.  The small business size standard is 1000. The anticipated award date for actions resulting from this synopsis is March 4, 2009.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.   Such submission should be addressed to AATD, Attn:  AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (Katherine Kearney), Building 401, Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Ms. Kearneys phone number is (757) 878-5703.  Anyone desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing at the above email addresses or facsimile number.  Contracting Officer is Lauren Sebring who can be reached at (757) 878-4828.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (b)(1)(ii) - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, Unique Supplies or Services. The US Army has a requirement to field Counter Sniper Systems in support of the Global War on Terror (GWOT). These systems will be fielded in both Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) & Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). The Army is looking for a software change to the Boomerang Acoustic Gunfire Detection System (AGDS) to enable it to communicate directly with  the CROWS II weapon platform for slew to cue functionality. When a shot is detected by the Boomerang AGDS, the User will have the option to directly slew the CROWS II to the location of the potential sniper as provided by the AGDS. The goal is to slew the RWS accurately enough so that the potential sniper is within its field of view when the vehicle is stationary. The Boomerang will continue to yield audible and visual alerts on the AGDS display, and rely on the CROWS II FCU to accept the slew command. 
This notice is not a solicitation and does not obligate the government to issue a Solicitation, nor will the government be liable for any costs involved for submission of information in response to this notice.

US Personal Services Contract
American Embassy Mexico City, Mexico
Narcotics Affairs Section
NAS Logistics Advisor


GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

A.  BACKGROUND:  The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is charged with developing strategies and programs to achieve international narcotics control and law enforcement foreign policy objectives.  The Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) in Mexico implements a country program that currently includes 12 broad projects with $26 million in funding.  The Merida Initiative is a new, comprehensive, multi-year regional initiative designed to provide U.S. foreign assistance to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean in support of counternarcotics, law enforcement professionalization and criminal justice capacity building efforts that will initially provide over $215 million to Mexico and $29.8 million to Central America and the Caribbean in FY 2008 funding. The FY 2009 budget proposal and FY 2009 bridge supplemental includes $498 million for Mexico and $100 million for Central America and the Caribbean. Total funding will approach $1.4 billion over the life of the program.  

The NAS Logistics Advisor is responsible for the overall management of logistics operations for the NAS, the supervision of the subordinate staff, and the actual performance of typical logistics functions to include acquisitions/procurement including the use of purchase cards, inventory/property management, physical facilities, space management, travel and transportation, customs clearances, information systems support and motor pool.  The Logistics Advisor works under the direction of the NAS Management Officer.  The NAS receives management support from the Embassy Management Section and Regional Security Office under an ICASS (International Cooperative Administrative Support Services) agreement.  This support is augmented with a staff of 12 LES (FSN/PSA/EFM) personnel performing logistical work (procurement, property management, motor pool, customs clearances and shipping, travel and information systems support) in the NAS Management Office.  The size and workload of the NAS Management Office is increasing due to the Merida Initiative, a multi-year, multi-million dollar program to provide equipment and training to support law enforcement operations and technical assistance for long-term reform and oversight of security agencies.  


B.  PURPOSE:  The NAS Logistics Advisor plays a central role in the management of NAS programs in Mexico and Merida Initiative countries.  The incumbent interacts on a daily basis with Department of State officers in the Management Section (General Services Officer (GSO), Financial Management Officer (FMO), Information Management Officer (IMO), Human Resources Officer (HRO), Facilities Manager (FM), and Management Counselor (MGT)) and Regional Security Officer (RSO) as well as officials from other Department of State sections, USG agencies in the mission, the embassy Logistics Center in Brownsville, TX, the Regional Procurement Support Office (RPSO) in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, the Bureau International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) and other Department of State offices.  The NAS Logistics Advisor supervises a staff of foreign national and U.S. personnel who work in conjunction with counterparts in the embassy Management Section providing essential administrative support services to the NAS.  The incumbent will also coordinate the work of one equivalent Customs & Shipping position funded by NAS and located in the Brownsville Logistics Center for the purpose of expediting clearance of NAS sponsored shipments from the Brownsville Logistics Center into Mexico and possibly from other border posts into Mexico.

<DESC>NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE!
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement to purchase a multiple carrier wireless/cell phone in-building connectivity system, post implementation support and maintenance support.  MMAC is a campus environment and is comprised of over fifty buildings plus tunnels connecting certain major buildings.  The wireless/cell phone in-building connectivity requirement will start with the fifteen most heavily occupied buildings (see spreadsheet), the Security Command center and the tunnel area. This requirement is to provide all personnel with cell phone connectivity within buildings, in basements and tunnel areas.  This requirement should also take into account the radar signals at MMAC and should in no way interfere with those signals.
Various organizations have purchased and installed Wilson amplifiers, duplexers, and antennas.  However, the current equipment covers only specific areas of those buildings where it is installed.  The purpose for this request for information is to have connectivity throughout all buildings including the tunnel area.
If the MMAC telephone switch were to incur loss of function, the cell phone in-building connectivity would allow for communication to continue.  Also, when all personnel are sent to the basements and tunnel areas during times of impending weather, this connectivity would assure continued communication and could be utilized, if required, as part of disaster recovery communication.  
Drawings are currently available for the top fifteen buildings, however due to security risks, these drawings will be available at a preproposal conference to be scheduled at a later date and will require a non-disclosure agreement.  The drawings will be signed out to the requesting party and will be returned to the FAA after use.  The drawings are in electronic format and require AutoCad software for viewing.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517210; Wireless Telecommunications Carriers, with a small business size standard of 1,500 employees.
Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the source list for this requirement and to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or the 8(a) program in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.  
Interested vendors should respond with the following:1.   Documentation that clearly demonstrates that the interested vendor is capable of fulfilling the requirement as evidenced by answering the questions that follow.  (The format of the documentation is at the discretion of the vendor)a.   Can the vendor provide signal for wireless telecommunications (cell phones, pagers, Blackberry, etc) to building, including basement and tunnel areas.  If yes, please provide proof.b.   The FAA has a national wireless program and provides various carrier devices.  Can vendor's equipment provide non-carrier specific service?  c.   Explain how the vendor provides service in b.d.   What equipment is required?e.   Does the vendor install the equipment?f.   Does the vendor maintain equipment after installation?g.   Is there a instructional class that the FAA technicians can attend for certification to maintain the equipment?h.   Is the equipment currently installed in another government facility?  If so, include location and point of contact.i.   When is the vendor available to begin installation and how much time is required for completion?j.   The equipment would be located in our telecommunications' closets.  Is the equipment wall mounted, rack mounted, etc?k.   All buildings have shielding (older buildings have wire mesh, new buildings have metal faces).  Will vendor's equipment/signal work with shielded buildings?l.   Give an explanation of your company, equipment and services, not to exceed 20 pages.
2.   Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.   The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
The survey is not to be construed as a screening information request (SIR), nor request for offer (RFO).  As such, the FAA will not accept unsolicited proposals and will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial response.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.
All responses should clearly be labeled WIRELESS.  Vendors must respond by 4:30 p.m. (CST), March 9, 2009.  Responses should be submitted electronically in either a portable document format (ie. *.pdf file) or Microsoft Word to: Diana.Pickel@faa.gov.  FAA will not respond telephonic inquiries.
This acquisition will be conducted in a phased approach.  This, the initial phase involves the announcement of the requirement in order to permit companies to provide the required responses.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this announcement will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this public announcement.
Note:  Any contract awarded resulting from this survey will contain the AMS Clause 3.3.1-33 Central Contractor Registration (April 2006).  Award cannot be made to a vendor that has not accomplished this registration.
This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises:  The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.

<a href="mailto:alissa.m.turner@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, New England</a>
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.<BR><BR><BR>	The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, is issuing this sources sought announcement to request submissions from companies that manufacture additives for bituminous highway paving mixtures as described.  The product process shall be a polymer additive which is added to a standard highway paving mix at the asphalt plant. When placed and compacted, the in-place pavement shall be such that the void space is reduced to the point at which the pavement is considered waterproof and a waterproofing membrane is not required, and the density is increased to the point at which potholes and rutting are minimized or totally eliminated.  Documentation of these properties shall be based on the product/process meeting the criteria of the following tests and requirements. <BR><BR>	Test for Fatigue Rating:  This test shall compare an unmodified AC-20 asphalt mix with a similar asphalt mix with the specific additive as part of the mix binder to assess fatigue resistance.  The samples shall be tested according to AASHTO TP8:  Standard Test Method for Determining the Fatigue Life of Compacted Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) Subjected to Repeated Flexural Bending.  The beam fatigue testing shall be conducted at a test temperature of 25C, a loading frequency of 5 Hertz, and a tensile strain level of 600 microstrains.  Samples shall be compacted to 7 plus or minus 1 percent air voids for testing.  Fatigue failure is defined as the number of fatigue cycles which correspond to a 50 percent reduction in the initial beam stiffness.  Results shall be considered to meet criteria, that is, shall be considered to have sufficient fatigue resistance, when each sample of the modified mix demonstrates a minimum fatigue resistance of 250,000 cycles at 25C and at least three times that of the unmodified AC-20 binder mix as determined by AASHTO TP 8.<BR><BR>	Test for Rut Resistance:  The objective of this test shall be to evaluate the rutting characteristics of the additive modified asphalt mixture under test wheel loadings at elevated temperatures.  Two types of hot mix asphalt mixtures shall be used:  one a neat AC-20 asphalt binder; and the second using the same AC-20 binder modified with the proposed additive.  The aggregate for both asphalt mixes shall be the same.  Three Marshall samples shall be prepared for each hot mix asphalt (HMA) per ASTM D1559, Resistance to Plastic Flow of Bituminous Mixtures Using Marshall Apparatus.  The compaction machine and procedures used for fabricating the asphalt beams shall be according to State of Georgia DOT GDT 115, Method of Test For Determining Rutting Susceptibility Using The Loaded Wheel Tester, Specifications.  The loaded wheel testing shall be also be performed according to Georgia DOT GDT 115.  Tests shall be performed at 40 C and 60 C.  Results shall be considered to meet criteria when the following values are met or exceeded:  the rut depth, in inches, for the AC-20 with additive sample is a maximum of half the value for the neat AC-20 sample.  The following minimum rut depths for the AC-20 with additive sample, tested at 40 C shall not exceed the following values:  for 1,000 cycles, a maximum rut depth of 0.04 inches; for 8,000 cycles, a maximum rut depth of 0.05 inches.  The following minimum rut depths for the AC-20 with additive sample, tested at 60 C shall not exceed the following values:  for 1,000 cycles, a maximum rut depth of 0.15 inches; for 8,000 cycles, a maximum rut depth of 0.20 inches. <BR><BR>	Test for Resistance to Chloride Ion Penetration:  This test shall measure the resistance of a concrete specimen with an asphalt coating containing the special additive binder applied to its surface to the penetration of chloride ion.  Testing shall be performed in general accordance with AASHTO T259, Resistance of Concrete to Chloride Ion Penetration.  Four concrete test specimens shall be made and cured according to AASHTO T126, Making and Curing Concrete Test Specimens in the Laboratory.  Each slab shall be not less than 3 thick and 12 square.  The specimens shall be moist cured for 14 days and placed in a drying room for 7 days according to AASHTO T160, Length Change of Hardened Hydraulic Cement Mortar and Concrete.  Each specimen shall then be removed from the drying room and be coated with a standard highway asphalt mix with additive contained in the binder.  When the specimens have cooled to ambient temperature, they shall be returned to the drying room for 7 days.  At that time, they shall be removed from the drying room, 0.75 high by 0.5 wide dams shall be built around the top edges of three of the four specimens, and returned to the drying room for a final 14 days.  The fourth specimen shall be the control.  The degree of saturation of the specimens at the time of ponding will affect the chloride ingress, i.e., water saturated concrete will absorb significantly less chlorides than a drier, but similar material.  Thus, for proper definition of chloride ingress, the requirements for a total of 28 days drying time must be strictly adhered to.  At the end of the drying period, 42 days, three of the four specimens shall be subjected to continuous ponding with a three percent sodium chloride solution approximately 0.5 inches deep for ninety days.  Glass plates shall be placed over the dams to retard evaporation of the solution and the specimens placed in the drying room for a ninety day period.  After 90 days of exposure, the solution shall be removed from the specimen, the specimens shall be allowed to dry, and all salt crystal build up shall be removed from the surfaces. Samples shall then be taken from depths of 0.0625 inches to 0.5 inches, and from 0.5 inches to 1.0 inches per AASHTO T259.  The chloride content shall then be determined for each sample in accordance with AASHTO T260.  Results shall be considered to satisfy criteria, negligible transmission of chloride ions, when either no sample exceeds 0.03 percent chlorides, or no sample exceeds the percent chloride in the control by greater than 0.01 percent.<BR><BR>	Test for Impermeability:  This test shall consist of preparing and testing compacted hot mix samples employing the specific additive in accordance with ASTM D 5084, Measurement of Hydraulic Conductivity of Saturated Porous Materials Using a Flexible Wall Permeameter.  Results shall be considered to meet criteria, asphalt pavement samples are essentially impermeable, when the hydraulic conductivity of each sample is equal to or less than 10 to the minus eighth power cm per sec.<BR><BR>	Test for Resilient Modulus:  This test shall consist of preparing and testing laboratory-prepared Hot Mix Asphalt samples using the proposed additive as an integral part of the binder to determine resilient modulus of elasticity at varying temperatures.  All testing shall be in accordance with ASTM D 4123, Indirect Tension Test for Resilient Modulus of Bituminous Mixtures.  Results shall be considered to satisfy criteria when the modulus of elasticity of all samples equals or exceed 200,000 pounds per square inch at a test temperature of 25 C.<BR><BR>	Test Values for Proposed Additive and Asphalt Binder Only: The following tests shall be performed on the proposed additive and asphalt binder, according to the referenced test methods indicated.  Nominal required values are listed also.  The Performance Grade Test per AASHTO MP1 shall produce a nominal result of PG 94 34.  The Dynamic Shear Ratio Test per AASHTO TP5 shall produce a nominal result of 1.034 kPa at 118 C.  The Creep Stiffness Test per AASHTO TP3 shall produce a nominal result of 90 Mpa at minus 24 C.  The Elastic Recovery Test per ASTM D6084 shall produce a nominal result of 92 percent at 10 C.  The Force Ratio Test per AASHTO T300 shall produce a nominal result of 0.99.  The Toughness Test per ASTM D5801 shall produce a nominal result of 210 inch pounds.  The Tenacity Test per ASTM D5801 shall produce a nominal result of 140 inch pounds.  Results shall be considered to satisfy criteria if all test result values fall within 5 percent of the nominal values listed above.<BR><BR>	Interested manufacturers shall submit written specifications, catalog cuts, and 3 customer references with greater than three years successful field installation of the product.  Firm shall indicate business classification size (e.g. 8(a), HUBZone, etc.). The NAICS Code is 324121 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  Responses are required no later than 13 March 2009.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  Alissa Turner.

<DESC><p>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB intends to award a 6 month with a 1 year option, sole source, Cost-Plus-Fix-Fee Contract, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiations, to Northrop Grumman. This acquisition is unrestricted. The NAICS code is 541511.
<p>Period of Performance (POP): 1 April 09 - 30 Sep 09<br />Option POP: 1 Oct 09 - 30 Sep 10</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE OF WORK. The contractor shall provide all personnel, vehicles, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform Rehost ATC Automation Software and Radio Control Switching System support.</p>
<p>The mission of the R-2508 Section, which includes the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) air traffic control (ATC) and mission control facilities, is to provide air traffic control services for all aircraft flying in airspace complex R-2508 and to relay advisories to mission aircraft. A key component of the ATC system that furnishes the controllers with radar data depiction of aircraft position, altitude, and projected flight path is the Rehost system. The objective is to provide the R-2508 Complex with efficient, effective, performance-based Rehost applications software maintenance and development services by a highly qualified, fully trained and dedicated workforce. R-2508 components include Department of Defense (DoD) components at Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB), NAWS China Lake (NAWC-WD), and Fort Irwin, and the Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The contractor shall provide all the labor, subject to the hours by labor category in the accepted proposal, required to perform the software support described within this PWS in a manner that meets the objectives stated, performed in accordance with commercial industry standards.</p>
<p>1.1.1 The Radio Control Switching System (RCSS) is a multi-channel radio and intercom switching system that provides an automated interface for voice communications between the ATC operator positions and aircraft in the R-2508 airspace. RCSS interfaces with Rehost to provide continuous contact with the aircraft in the airspace.</p>
<p>1.1.2 The Rehost application is approximately 250,000 lines of C language software that runs on the Solaris UNIX operating system. Within the application there are approximately 20 logical components that were at one time labeled computer software configuration items (CSCIs). A Rehost backend CPU will typically have over 40 Rehost processes running concurrently and interacting via inter-process communication. There are typically two radar data acquisition CPU processors for redundancy, two backend CPU processors for redundancy, a dual Ethernet for redundancy, and a single Graphical Display Processor (GDP) workstation for each controller position.</p>
<p>1.1.3 The Rehost application capabilities can be described at the highest level as the GDP, the Central Mode Controller (CMC, storing state and including radar message processing, RMP), the On-Line Database (OLDB), the Multiple Model Tracker (MMT), and the Radar Multiplexer (RMUX). Radar data is received at the RMUX, is projected into the system plane by the RMP, is tracked by the MMT, and is sent for display at the GDP. Flight Plans and other commands are entered at the GDP, executed at the CMC and OLDB, and distributed back to all GDPs.<br /><br />1.1.4 The Rehost application uses third party COTS software with Northrop Grumman modifications for the video card display drivers, and for the RMUX radar data acquisition across serial communication interfaces. The Rehost application contains a proprietary generic database and a GUI for site adaptation management. The Rehost application runs on Solaris 2.6 through Solaris 10 operating systems, on the Sun SPARC and on the Intel x86 hardware platforms. The code has been ported to the Linux and AIX operating systems.</p>
<p>1.2 SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS: Provide priority and routine maintenance on the Rehost and RCSS applications software on a recurring and nonrecurring basis. Correct software problems so that its performance shall meet the RCSS or Rehost baseline software requirements specifications. Work in conjunction with FAA and DoD technical personnel to return the Rehost system back to an operational status when breakdown occurs. Included are activities necessary to correct software problems that degrade system performance, and those problems that can be worked around procedurally until a software fix is developed, tested and installed.</p>
<p>Contractor shall establish and maintain a Government Furnished Property laboratory for the purpose of testing and troubleshooting software for all deployed locations.</p>
<p>1.2.1 PRIORITY SERVICE: Provide priority software maintenance services to correct problems that cause non-recoverable, catastrophic interrupt to the RCSS or Rehost system operations resulting in decertifying the system for ATC. Provide software fixes that are required to restore RCSS or Rehost to a condition that equals or exceeds the RCSS or Rehost baseline system requirements specifications.</p>
<p>1.2.2 RECURRING/ROUTINE SOFTWARE SUPPORT SERVICES: Provide routine RCSS or Rehost applications software maintenance service as required.</p>
<p>1.2.3 NONRECURRING SOFTWARE SUPPORT SERVICES: Nonrecurring software maintenance service is a service needed on an "as required basis" and is not covered under priority or routine software fixes.</p>
<p>1.3 SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ENHANCEMENTS: The contractor shall provide software development and integration services, as required, to implement new or changing application requirements, operating system environment, hardware platforms or components, and to integrate the Rehost application to external systems.</p>
<p>LOCATION OF SOFTWARE SUPPORT SERVICES: The software support services may be at the following locations: Edwards AFB, CA; NAWS China Lake, CA; Fort Irwin, CA; or other locations within or near the territory encompassed by R-2508.</p>

DESCRIPTION: 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Spectrum Detector Inc, of Lake Oswego, OR for the acquisition of the purchase of Colorimeters and Equipment Parts to be used in the Physics Laboratory at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

*** Sole source determination is based on the need for Laboratory Equipment and Supplies features which must be of a highly specific character.  The new Colorimeters being ordered must be compatible with the other with the other three colorimeters at NIST, which were designed and manufactured by Spectrum Detector. Compatibility for both the fabrication and calibration are a must. Spectrum Detector Inc. redesigned the internal arrangement of the colorimeters and produced precision custom-made electro-optical instruments for internal arrangement for NIST. Spectrum also developed Si radiometers which will be utilized as preamplifiers in the new colorimeters being purchased. The colorimeter channels will be calibrated for spectral irradiance responsively at NIST with smaller than 0.1% expanded uncertainty.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334515, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by March 9, 2009 will be considered by the Government.

This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)-only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  DAPCO Industries is the only known source qualified to conduct field training on our ultrasonic rail testing truck and is capable of meeting the Governments requirement.  The hi-rail ultrasonic railroad track testing truck was purchased from DAPCO.

Therefore, only DAPCO is qualified to conduct this field training.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. CST on February 25, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.  Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to Kimberly.L.Dulaney@usace.army.mil with solicitation number referenced in the subject line.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard intends to procure TUITION FOR CHANGE MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION COURSE.  (SEE NOTE 22) This proposed procurement is for supply for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis to PROSCI INC, 1367 S GARFIELD AVE. LOVELAND, CO 80537.

BACKGROUND:

The United States Coast Guard (SCG) faces significant challenges that require us to think and act differently if we are to sustain the tremendous pace of change activities and our operational excellence.  Our command and control structures, support systems, and business practices have failed to keep up with our rapid growth.  To meet the challenges and threats of the 21st Century, we are reorganizing our command and control structure and realigning our support systems.  While planning and executing this reorganization, we are evaluating and implementing new processes to account for work and measure workload improve financial management systems, and manage workforce competencies, among other initiatives.  Organizational change is always difficult; executing significant organizational change without a reduction in effectiveness of day-to-day accomplishments is an enormous USCG challenge.  The Leadership Council recognizes that managing change is not, and is not likely to become, a core individual competency.  The Organizational Performance Consultants (OPCs) and Knowledge Management and Metrics Specialists (KMMS) pay a key USCG role as change enablers.  To meet this nee, and as part of their qualifications system, OPCs and KMMS are required to be trained and certified to use and help others use these easy, structured, integrated, change management tools.

This acquisition is not a continuation of a previous effort.  This is required training and certification for USCG OPCs and KMMS.

Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The hose supplied by the contractor must be a 3" fuel rated discharge hose with a 3" male camlock fitting.  The rate at which the fuel is required to be delivered is 250 GPM (gallons per minute).  The vessel requires refueling during the months of April through July.  This may vary dependent upon operations of the US Fish & Wildlife requirements. Anticipated fuel required at each port call will be between 20,000 to 25,000 gallons.

Beginning March 15, 2009, the Government shall compensate Contractor for any difference in excess of the fuel Base Price, dollar for dollar, for gallons of fuel used in accordance with FAR Clause 52.216-2, Economic Price Adjustment.
The Not-to-Exceed amounts, and unit prices will be reviewed annually, for each Option Period, for pricing in accordance with FAR Clause 52.216-02, Economic Price Adjustment.

Each corresponding contract unit price shall be decreased by the same percentage that the established price is decreased. The decrease shall apply to those items delivered on and after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractor's established price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly. (c) If the Contractor's applicable established price is increased after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price shall be increased, upon the Contractor's written request to the Contracting Officer, by the same percentage that the established price is increased, and the contract shall be modified accordingly, subject to the following limitations:(1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this clause shall not exceed 300 percent of the original contract unit price.(2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective-- (i) On the effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if the Contracting Officer receives the Contractor's written request within 10 days thereafter; or (ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request.(3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause.(4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the increase in the applicable established price.(5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase.(d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in subparagraph (c)(5) of this clause, and thereafter if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall continue deliveries according to the contract delivery schedule, and the Government shall pay for such deliveries at the contract unit price, increased to the extent provided by paragraph (c) of this clause.

TAB/FACTOR 9:    PRICE

The Government Evaluation Team may use all methods available to evaluate prices proposed including, but not limited to, an analysis based on the following:

Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to representative industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.

Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity in each contractor’s proposed price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the contractor’s technical proposal.

Price Risk:  The Government will evaluate the risk associated with pricing schemes given the proposed pricing schemes, terms and conditions.  Unrealistically low proposed prices, whether submitted initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirements.

52.212-2   EVALUATION—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 
 The Government will evaluate the Base Year and Option Year cost as a total cost per award. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of option period pricing shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options for that year.

(a) The Government will award one (1) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Technical and past performances, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. 
Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

The Offerors’ proposal shall meet the objectives outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW) and
provide the best value solution to the Government will be selected for award. The best value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government’s estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the stated objective.

(b) A cost and/or price analysis shall be conducted based upon the data submitted by the Offeror in order to determine that the negotiated cost or price to be fair and reasonable.

RATING METHODOLOGY     	
 
All factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, and/or Unacceptable, with the exception of  Past Performance which may be rated neutral.

The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:

The Government Evaluation Team members will independently rate the strengths and weaknesses of each Offeror’s technical proposal information. Each of the developed evaluation factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, or Unacceptable, with Outstanding representing the highest possible rating and Unacceptable representing the lowest possible rating. Only the Past Performance factor may be rated as neutral. The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:

•OUTSTANDING – The Evaluation Factor response is expected to contribute to the superior
achievement of the objectives with minimal or no risk. An assigned rating of OUTSTANDING
indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the submission contains very significant strengths and no weaknesses.

•GOOD – The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal risk in achieving the
objectives. A GOOD rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the submission contains considerable strengths, but also some weaknesses.

• ACCEPTABLE – The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal to moderate risk in achieving the objectives. An ACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, the submission contains weaknesses that offset strengths, but do not significantly detract from the submission. A rating of ACCEPTABLE is used when there are no indications of exceptional 	features or innovations that could prove to be beneficial and no major weaknesses that could diminish the quality of the effort or increase the risks of failure.

• UNACCEPTABLE – The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce moderate to excessive risk making it highly unlikely that performance would meet the objectives. An UNACCEPTABLE rating  indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the submission contains significant weaknesses that are not offset by strengths. The Offeror’s interpretation of the Government’s objective is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible or incorrect that it is considered unacceptable.

•NEUTRAL* - No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
* This rating shall only be applied to the PAST PERFORMANCE factor. A NEUTRAL rating is
neither favorable nor unfavorable.

Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation team’s assessment of the
technical proposal for accomplishing the Government’s objectives.

Price proposals will be evaluated but not rated.

An aerial photo of area to be mowed will be provided by Stockton Lake Project Office.  The definition below serves to indicate general mowing areas and boundaries.  Ultimately and above all else, mowing and trimming areas shall be as determined by the CO or his designated representative.  Such determinations shall prevail over definitions, descriptions, photos, drawings, or maps.  <BR><BR>Areas to be mowed include: <BR><BR>- Senator Kit Bond Information Center and Administration Building (office) lawn; <BR>- Maintenance Compound area; <BR>- Cedar Gap Picnic Shelter area; <BR>- a 30 foot strip from the shelter parking lot westward to entrance of Cedar Gap nature trail; <BR>- areas sloping from Administration Building to the South & to the West; <BR>- area sloping from Administration Building to the North to Service Road A; <BR>- a 50 foot strip along the South side of Service Road A between the Administration Building & Overlook area;<BR>- West Overlook & Restroom Building areas; <BR>- Switchyard area (North of the switchyard & Eastward to chain link fence)<BR><BR>All sidewalks in administration area, maintenance compound, overlook area, and picnic shelter areas shall be edged.

Acreage and number of mowings are estimated.  The Contractor shall be responsible for determining all acreage and conditions affecting the performance of the work. <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK: The Contractor shall provide all manpower, labor, equipment, materials/supplies, transportation, fuel, tools, supervision and other items and services necessary to provide mowing and trimming of designated areas at the Stockton Lake Project, near Stockton.  The Contractor shall perform to the standards in the contract.  Services also consist of attending annual pre-work conferences and meetings as necessary at Stockton Project office, and preparing quality control worksheets, invoices, and inputting contractor man hours online at https://cmra.army.mil/default.aspx.  A map of Stockton Lake can be found on the Internet at: http://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/st/.  All acreages are ESTIMATED.  The Contractor shall be responsible for determining exact acreage and conditions affecting performance of work.  Rocky terrain and heavily wooded areas may require an extensive amount of trimming and hand mowing where larger mowers cannot maneuver satisfactorily.  Trimming shall include the removal of sprouts and heavily weeded growth.  Prospective bidders are encouraged to visit and fully inspect all areas, accesses, locations, terrain, etc. prior to bidding.  The Government shall not be held accountable for conditions at the site which were not taken into account by prospective bidders.  Mowing shall be accomplished to within, but not closer than, 24 inches (+/- 6 inches) of the trunk of any tree, bush, or shrub; and to within, but not closer than, 12 inches (+/- 6 inches) of any inanimate objects, such as walls, posts, signs, park equipment, or other such objects.  Height of cut and exact limits of mowing and trimming areas shall be as directed by the Contracting Officer or his Representative.  Mowing and trimming operations around buildings and roadsides shall be performed so grass clippings are thrown away from buildings and away from the road whenever possible.  Mowing operations shall not be performed when the ground is so wet that mowing would cause rutting or would otherwise disturb existing turf; or when grass is so wet it will not cut.  Tractors shall be operated in such a manner as to protect against the sod being torn by the tractor wheels on turns.  All mowers (large and small) shall be compatible with each other in mowing height and appearance of cut grass.  After mowing, areas serviced under this contract shall present a neat, well-cared-for, and evenly mowed appearance, free from ruts or any unmowed strips or streaks.  Trimming is required in all areas.  Grass and weeds shall be trimmed around trees, shrubs, buildings, fences, poles, posts, fire hydrants, parking lots, curbs, parking lot bumper blocks (both sides), sidewalks, boulders, and other fixed obstacles.  Trimming height shall match surrounding area grass heights.  All areas shall be trimmed simultaneously, or immediately following mowing.  Immediately following trimming, the Contractor shall remove grass clippings or debris deposited as a result of mowing and trimming operations from all sidewalks, entrances into buildings, building interiors, and Cedar Gap Shelter (pavilion).  Extreme care shall be exercised when mowing and trimming around trees, bushes, shrubs, buildings, and other objects to insure that equipment does not come in contact with the object.  Trees or other objects shall NOT be bumped or scraped by equipment.  Trimming will not be required closer than two (2) inches around trunks of trees, bushes, or shrubs.  However, trimming around buildings and inanimate objects shall be accomplished to the last blade of grass.  Moveable objects shall be moved and the area around and under such objects shall be mowed and/or trimmed.  Immediately following mowing/trimming, such objects shall be returned to their original position.  All costs of repair or replacement in size, kind and type resulting from damage by the Contractor's equipment shall be borne by the Contractor. Repair or replacement shall occur within 30 calendar days of noticed damage.  The Contractor and employees/staff shall personally perform, or provide personal superintendence of the performance of, duties under this contract (no subcontracting).  The Contractor shall maintain a sufficient number of staff/employees to perform the required services.  In the event the Contractor is unable to perform contract duties as required, the Government reserves the right to terminate the contract.  Contractor personnel shall present a neat appearance and be fully clothed (meaning that a sleeved shirt or T-shirt, trousers, and shoes are worn) at all times while performing services ordered under the contract; except that this requirement shall not be construed to replace or eliminate the necessity for the wearing of appropriate protective clothing or devices as may be required for the safe performance of services or for the application of various approved chemicals (if any).  The Contractor shall provide own attire. Contractor personnel shall utilize tact, diplomacy, and courtesy at all times during contact with the public and with Government personnel.  The Contracting Officer and his Representative reserve the right to disapprove any individual whom he/she considers to be incompetent to perform the work required.  Such disapproval will be given to the Contractor by written notice.  Any such decision is final.  Any illegal or criminal activity on the part of the Contractor or staff, employees, or other personnel may result in termination of the contract.  In order to assure that the required services be performed at an acceptable level, the Contractor shall designate in writing a responsible on-site work crew representative, who shall serve as a contact for matters involving quality, performance, or nonperformance of required services assigned to that crew.  In the absence of a designated on-site representative, or if the designated on-site representative is not present, the Contractor warrants that any and all members of each work crew are qualified and fully competent with full authority to act for, and on behalf of, the Contractor, to insure the required work is performed in strict accordance with the contract specifications.  The Government reserves the right to discuss mowing and trimming matters with any Contractor employee on-site and currently employed by the Contractor.  Equipment breakdown shall NOT relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of performing the work as specified.  It shall be the Contractors responsibility to assure that he or she has, or can obtain on short notice, sufficient backup equipment to continue the services as specified without interruption in the event of mechanical failure of primary equipment.  Information on quality control and assurance can be obtained by contacting cynthia.a.clark@usace.army.mil.  If any of the Contractors services do not conform to contract requirements, the Government may request the Contractor to perform the services again, where appropriate, in conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount.  When the defects in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may (1) require the contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements, and (2) reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.  NOTE: If the contractor fails to promptly re-perform the services or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may by contract, or otherwise: (1) perform the services and charge to the Contractor any cost incurred by the government that is directly related to the performance of such service, or (2) terminate the contract in whole or in part.  The Government reserves the right to cause the specified work to be performed by a third party or Government personnel and the cost incurred thereby will be levied against the Contractor.  Any time Government personnel are used because of Contractor's nonperformance, the cost levied against the Contractor will include all direct costs associated with the performance of the specified work.  The direct cost to the Government for substitution of the Government personnel removed from their normal duties is computed on an hourly basis at the applicable wage rate.  Government personnel will be used only when time is of the essence and the interests of the Government would not be served by securing a third party to perform the specified work.  In accordance with the FAR Clause 52.228-5 the Contractor shall obtain and maintain during the period of performance under this contract insurance as required.  For insurance requirements, contact cynthia.a.clark@usace.army.mil.  The Government will furnish necessary keys and Contractor Quality Control worksheets for the Contractors use.  The Contractor shall furnish all equipment, supplies, items, labor, materials, insurance, services, etc. to accomplish the services specified.  All equipment must be approved by the Contracting Officer or the Contracting Officer's Representative prior to initial use.  Mowers shall be tractor mounted rotary type, multiple spindle (lawn type), or flail: equipped with adjustable side-mounted skids, capable of producing a smooth even cut, with a cutting height adjustable from 3 to 6 inches.  Mowing around the Administration Building includes the following special requirements: The two lawn areas in front of the administration building, which contain a sprinkler system, shall be mowed with a walk-behind hydro-drive commercial type finish mower, with a minimum of 36 inch mowing width floating deck, and a mowing height capability of 3 inches to 6 inches.  Commercial riding lawn mowers will not be used in these two areas.  The minimum allowable mowing height for all areas shall be 3 inches.  Blades shall be sharpened and/or replaced often enough to assure smooth grass cut.  All mowers shall be constructed to distribute grass clipping evenly to prevent clumps or windrows.  Trimming equipment shall consist of power hand mowers, weed eaters or other type power trimmers, weed whips, and other equipment and tools as may be appropriate for the task.<BR><BR>Stockton Lake is a flood control reservoir in Missouri, with numerous parks and access areas managed by or leased from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Park areas at Stockton Lake Project offer a wide variety of recreation facilities including boat launching ramps, campgrounds, full service marinas, picnic areas, and sand swimming beaches.  Many routine maintenance items are contracted to the private sector.  Mowing, refuse collection, and facility cleanup are just a few of the activities that are performed by private contractors for the Corps of Engineers at Stockton Lake Project.  The Contractor shall not commit or permit any act which may interfere with the performance of work by another Contractor or Government employee(s).  Volunteers may be utilized in the parks.  Volunteers receive and follow instructions from a Government representative, not the Contractor.  The Contractor should not consider any volunteer as his/her employee.  The Contractor shall be liable for any damages or injuries caused by their pets.  When outside, pets shall be on a leash at all times.  Smoking is not allowed in all Government buildings, including shower buildings, vault toilets, etc.  Smoking is also not allowed by the Contractor while in direct contact with the public.  The Contractor shall not possess, during the performance of this contract, any item, including firearms, that can be used as a weapon.  Title 36 regulates firearms on Federal property.  The road across the dam may be closed from time to time during the life of this contract.  The closure of the dam may continue for several months under certain security, construction, or maintenance circumstances.  The Contractor shall be prepared to take an alternate route during these times, at no additional cost to the government.  After award, but prior to start of services, the Project Office will arrange a Post-Award/Pre-Work conference to be held at the Project.  The purpose of the conference is to discuss contract requirements and details of contract performance, in order to develop a mutual understanding of both.  A Prework conference will likely be held each year in the spring prior to start of services under any renewal options that may be exercised.  In addition, other meetings may be held as necessary.  The Government reserves the right to schedule meetings with the Contractor.  Meetings shall be scheduled to take place at the Project Office as necessary to ensure strict compliance with the terms of the contract, to coordinate work schedules in compliance with the contract specifications, and to arrange a satisfactory operating agreement.  After award, all documents and related correspondence shall be routed through the Contracting Officer or his Representative (COR) at Stockton Lake Project Office.  Payment will not be made for services not performed.  The Contractor shall provide the Project Office with an invoice for each mowing that is ordered, after performance of the services ordered, requesting payment for ordered services.  Payment shall be made in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act.  Payment will be made via VISA card immediately upon satisfactory completion of services, or if the vendor doesnt accept VISA, then payment will be made via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) into the Contractors banking account approximately 30 days after the last day of services received for the billing period, or 30 days after receipt of the invoice, whichever is later.  To enable EFT, the Contractor will be provided a blank direct deposit form.<BR><BR>SAFETY: Appropriate measures shall be taken to protect the general public from accidental injury.  All services shall be performed in accordance with applicable safety requirements set forth in Corps of Engineers Manual EM-385-1-1, Safety and Health Requirements Manual and supplements thereto (copies are available from the Project Office).  ANY EQUIPMENT OR MATERIALS NOT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE SAFETY MANUAL SHALL BE REMOVED FROM GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IMMEDIATELY.  Prior to beginning work on this contract the Contractor shall have an approved Accident Prevention Plan. This plan shall be in accordance with the most recent EM 385-1-1. The plan is intended to be a viable document and enhance the safety of Project staff and visitors.  The Contractor will be expected to take a vital interest in safety, hazard, and educate their employees to work and plan their work safely. Proper driving techniques and defensive driving will be practiced to prevent vehicle accidents and property damage.  In order to provide safety controls for protection to the life and health of employees and other persons; for prevention of damage to property, materials, supplies and equipment; and for avoidance of work interruptions in the performance of this contract, the Contractor shall comply with all pertinent provisions of the Federal, State, and local regulations and shall take or cause to be taken such additional measures as the Contracting Officer may determine to be reasonable and necessary for the purpose.  Contractor vehicles shall be equipped with 4 way flashers and turn signals in operating condition.  Flashers shall be activated when vehicles are parked on, or traveling slowly along roadways.  Any injury, property damage, equipment malfunction, or safety hazard observed by the Contractor shall be immediately reported to the Project personnel.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:
Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), 
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602
Washington, D. C. 20593-0001

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the following:   

1.	In  Section L.6.2(d) of the RFP, , the Government addressed oral presentations by offerors selected for the competitive range.  However, the solicitation did not make clear that the Government intended to evaluate such oral presentations using the evaluation criteria stated in Section M.  Accordingly, Offerors are advised that firms selected to the competitive range may be required to provide oral presentations, and that those oral presentations (if any) will be used in the technical proposal evaluation for contract award.  This clarification impacts those only those offerors selected for the competitive range.  Therefore, there is no requirement to submit revisions to technical or price proposals, nor will any technical or price proposal revisions be accepted by the Government at this time.  Changes in the RFP are highlighted for the convenience of all offerors.

2.	Currently, Oral Presentations for offerors selected to the Competitive Range phase of this competition are anticipated to occur between March 30 and April 10, 2009.  Treasury reserves the right to modify this schedule at its sole discretion.

3.	Due Diligence sessions for offerors selected to the Competitive Range phase of this competition are anticipated to occur between March 19 and March 30, 2009.  Treasury reserves the right to modify this schedule at its sole discretion.

Please note that the vendor on-site due diligence sessions are intended to be a technical session only and will be strictly limited to questions regarding the Data Center Facility, equipment and environment.  The government may also discuss technical changes that have taken place in the environment since the Request for Proposals was released as well as technical changes that may occur prior to contract award.

4.	The following sections of the RFP Performance Work Statement are amended as follows: 

7.4 Performance Surveillance Plan
   7.4.1 Performance Measurement
      7.4.1.1  The SLAs presented throughout the PWS represent the
        Government’s proposed performance measurement structure. Offerors, selected to the competitive range must identify any instances where they take exceptions to these SLA’sand provide alternative SLAs in the event the Contracting Officer requests revised proposal submissions. 

7.4.1.2  The first two (2) quarters after contract startup (10/1/2009 to 3/31/2010) shall be considered the “burnin” period for the SLAs. During this period SLAs will be tracked, monitored, and reported against the targets as part of the monthly Program Management Review. However, disincentives and eligibility for award terms shall not start until the third 3rd quarter of the contract (starting on 4/1/2010).

Change Hi-lo bow/side rails with dive door to Hi-lo bow/side rails Boston Whaler part # 61502 with dive door or equal.  <BR><BR>2.  Change Rails, Bow Boarding  Haze Grey Powdercoat to Rails, Bow Boarding Boston Whaler part # 61508  Haze Grey Powdercoat or equal.  <BR><BR>3.  Change Raymarine interactive E-120 or equal to flush mount to Raymarine interactive E-80 flush mount or equal.<BR><BR>The following question and answer is provided for informational purposes only.<BR>Question:  I had to make a couple of variances.  One is you requested a RayMarine E-120 Display unit.  This size is a little too big for this console, so I substituted it with the E-80.  Also, this boat comes standard with a 30 transom for 30 shaft length engines.  The Yamaha F225 4-stroke is only available with a 25 shaft length.  We can install this engine, but it requires notching the transom to lower it 5 for this engine.  A much better option would be to go with the Yamaha F250 4-stroke engine which is available in the 30 shaft length.  This boat model has a maximum HP rating of 300 and the 250 HP engine is a better option for the law enforcement use.  You also requested two different styles of bow/side rails.  I included one of them.  Please let me know if these changes are acceptable, so that I can proceed with quote.<BR><BR>Answer:  <BR>1.  See Amendment 001 for change to the Ray Marine unit size specification.  <BR>2.  The specifications call for a Yamaha F225 engine or equal.  During             solicitation for products, the Government is unable to discuss whether specific variances are or are not acceptable.  It is recommended that offerors provide everything the specifications call for; and if they wish to offer a variance or better value to the Government it should be done as an optional item or an optional change to the specifications.<BR>3.  See Amendment 001 for clarification on the style of bow/side rails.

<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 9pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a name="Text1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Technical Capability</span></a></p>
<p><span style="mso-bookmark: Text1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Past Performance</span></span></p>

<p style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>Technical capability, past performance, and price when combined, are <span style="color: #ff0000;">comparatively equal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 9pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a name="Text1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Technical Capability</span></a></p>
<p><span style="mso-bookmark: Text1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Past Performance</span></span></p>

<p style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>Technical capability, past performance, and price when combined, are <span style="color: #ff0000;">comparatively equal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis is being re-submitted due to an inadvertent error in posting of the NAICS code.  The original NAICS code was 541380 and should have been 541712.<BR><BR>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT. It is the Governments intent to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Contract for the investigation and failure analysis of Category 1 Product Quality Deficiency Reports (CAT 1 PQDRs) on aircraft exhibits for the Aviation Engineering Directorate (AED) within the US Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC). A CAT 1 PQDR describes an unsafe condition, operational or maintenance procedure for an aircraft, mission related equipment, component or module, or repair part that may cause death, injury, or severe occupational illness, that would cause loss or major damage to a weapon system, critically restricts the combat readiness capabilities of the using organization, and which would result in a production line stoppage. The priority level of these exhibits mandates that the failure analyses be performed in not more than 45 calendar days. The analyses performed will provide the mode of failure and the root cause determination that includes a determination as to whether or not the pertinent parts in question meet dimensional and other requirements as documented in source drawings. The proposed period of performance is from AUGUST 2010 through JULY 2015, and may involve performance of 10 to 20 failure analyses per year.<BR><BR>Offerors must demonstrate the ability to perform CAT 1 PQDR failure analyses by providing atleast three sample reports for similar work. A complete listing of all current analytical equipment and tooling; the average turnaround time and capacity on similar projects; and a list of qualifications for current employees is also requested.<BR><BR>The Government is seeking to determine whether two or more small businesses are capable of performing the work outlined in the description above. The Government is asking for responses from all responsible Small Business sources that can demonstrate their capability to perform the work and provide the requested documentation pertaining to the sample report, equipment list and personnel qualifications by the closing date of this sources sought notice. This information will be used to evaluate each sources capability to perform integration requiring the use of proprietary information and determine whether or not this acquisition will be designated as a small business set-aside or a full and open competition.  The proposed contract listed herein is being considered for a 100% small business set aside, and is subject to the availability of funds. By U.S. Law, participation in Small Business Set-Asides is restricted to U.S. small businesses; therefore, submission of information by foreign sources will not be honored.<BR><BR>The most recent AED effort was awarded on a sole source basis to Dayton T Brown under Contract W58RGZ-05-C-0318, a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, Basic Contract plus five one-year Options, with a total potential dollar value of approximately $5.0M.<BR><BR>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. Responses to this announcement are due no later than 1600 (CST) on 03 March 2009. Formal communication related to this Acquisition should be directed to Paula Parker, Contract Specialist. You may fax, mail, or email the requested information to US Army Aviation and Missile Command, ATTN: CCAM-RD-B, Paula Parker/Research Development and Engineering Center, Building 5400, Room B142, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898; EMAIL: paula.parker1@us.army.mil; FAX NUMBER: (256) 876-7600.

In general, it will be the responsibility of the CM at risk to integrate the design and construction phases, utilizing their skill and knowledge of general contracting to develop schedules, prepare project construction estimates, study labor conditions, perform site investigations, and perform other similar tasks to contribute to the development of the project during the pre-construction/design phase. 

During the construction phase, the CM at risk will be responsible for construction of the project under the Guaranteed Maximum Price inclusive of all construction services therein. The CM at risk will utilize all labor, material, equipment, supervision, and transportation to maintain existing utilities.

The JFKC garage exists on three levels below the footprint of the Kennedy Center building.  It has three levels, one of which is on grade and the other two are structured. The structure consists of a 10-½ inch thick cast in place, non-post tensioned slab, with small drop panels at the columns. The columns are steel with a substantial cast in place encasement with a mushroom cap, which supports the garage slabs. North and south additions to the garage are post-tensioned concrete. The new areas are not included in the repair program. The elevated garage slabs, which cover an area of about 375,000 sq. ft., exhibit a varying degree of deterioration on the underside. The top side of most slab areas was partially removed and recast under an earlier repair campaign using a micro silica concrete, and are topped with a traffic bearing membrane. During the repair work all normal garage operations and programs will continue, requiring maintenance of existing utilities, protection of adjacent properties and the traffic flow patterns.

Grimm and Parker Architects have been contracted for the design services, including construction administration and will remain contracted directly to the Kennedy Center for the duration of the project.  

Proposals will be evaluated using the source selection procedures contained in the Request for Proposal (RFP), and award will be based upon the Best Value to the Government.  Technical factors are considered more importance than price. The Technical Factors to be addressed are: Firms Qualifications and Past Performance, Project Approach, Key Personnel Qualifications and Apprenticeship Program effort. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236220, Commercial Institutional Building Construction. The Size Standard is $28.5M. The estimated range for this project is between $1 Million and $2 Million.  The estimated time for completion is 22 months at 8 hours per day, Monday through Friday.  The estimated solicitation release date is March 5, 2009.  The estimated due date for proposals is April 2, 2009.

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE:  Management and support services to the research and development activities of the HIV Drug Resistance Program (HIV-DRP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR).</p>
<p><br />Notice Number:<br />SS-NCI-90001-MM</p>
<p>Issued By:<br />National Cancer Institute (NCI), <br />Office of Acquisitions (OA) <br />http://www.nci.nih.gov  or http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/</p>
<p>Key Dates:<br />Capability Statement Due Date:  March 5, 2009</p>
<p>General Information:</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Proposal (REP). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should  such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The purpose of this contract is to:  (1) provide program augmentation and support for the HIV-DRP of the National Cancer Institute; (2) provide professional services, including studies and analysis; and (3) technical support for HIV-DRP activities or other new projects.  The HIV Drug Resistance Program (HIV-DRP) represents a focused basic science research effort that addresses this need and builds on the existing strength of HIV and retrovirus research within the Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NCI intramural research program has a long-standing tradition of strength in retroviruses, due to their importance to cancer research. This tradition has carried over into AIDS research, and there are currently more than 20 research groups within the NCI and contract laboratories who devote at least part of their effort to the study of HIV.  The studies currently underway range from basic research into how the virus interacts with its host cell to vaccine development and drug discovery.  The NCI houses one of the largest and most productive HIV and retrovirus research programs in the world. At present, there is no organizational mechanism to coordinate the efforts of the many groups within the program, despite their focus on many common problems.</p>
<p>Description of Information to be included in the Capability Statement:</p>
<p>Objective:<br />Specifically, the contractor/individual shall be expected to provide program development, building on past successes. The work to be performed covers a large variety of tasks, including:<br />1. Reviewing and making recommendations regarding design and interpretation of experiments covering the entire range of HIV studies (from basic to translational to clinical to prevention studies) performed by DRP personnel. Because some of the research done in HIV-DRP involves non-HIV retroviruses, a broad knowledge of retrovirology is essential.<br />2.  Review and provide written in depth analysis of scientific manuscripts prepared by Principal Investigators (PIs) in the program.  <br />3.  Meet with DRP PIs to discuss research results and ongoing experiments.  As an expert in the field, attend lectures/presentations by junior staff and provide critique to include suggestions for future scientific presentations.<br />4.  Review written patient protocols to determine feasibility of patients, drugs, conditions, budgets, how many beds needed, and timeframe of study.  Review analyses from different patients, drug reactions/interactions, on study continuance, changes, etc.<br />5.  Reviewing and making recommendations regarding the organization and staffing of the DRP and CCR AIDS research Programs.<br />6.  Provide services in the organization of scientific conferences relating to HIV and AIDS.<br />7. Researching and relaying the latest scientific and technological advances applicable to the HIV and AIDS research, and making recommendations regarding their application to the research goals of the DRP and CCR.<br />8. Reviewing and making recommendations regarding management of the DRP and COE (Center of Excellence) AIDS research budgets.<br />9.  Representing the DRP to the scientific community:  provide recommendations and guidance on developing the agenda for the annual DRP Symposium on Antiviral Drug Resistance, as well as the annual HIV Think Tank meeting; represent the HIV-DRP at scientific meetings devoted to HIV, AIDS, and antiviral drug resistance. Attend four scientific meetings during the contract period to keep abreast of scientific discoveries.  <br />10.  Participate in onsite meetings with CCR management as well as the HIV and Cancer Virology Center of Excellence leadership to provide recommendations concerning the overall research direction of the HIV-DRP and the associated cost impact on the fiscal year budget.  <br />11.  The contractor shall typically be at the NCI Frederick two days per week (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) during the contract period.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>These tasks can only be accomplished successfully by contractor personnel who have research training and experience necessary to perform the duties specified and meeting the following requirements:<br />1.  The contractor shall be involved in the area of HIV and AIDS research conducted in a laboratory setting, and experienced in management and strategic planning necessary to the operation of an internationally recognized HIV/AIDS research program. <br />2.  A broad, up-to-date, and sophisticated understanding of all aspects of research in HIV/AIDS and who have the deep understanding of research that comes from a long and successful career in research in many facets of HIV and retrovirus research with an expertise that extends from basic biochemistry and virology to patient-based studies and the interpretation of clinical data.<br />3.  To be able to provide relevant recommendations and guidance to the DRP and the CCR the contractor needs to have experience in the direction and management of large research programs, including recruitment of PIs and other personnel, development of their research programs and careers, analysis and development of operating budgets, development of research goals and creation and implementation of strategic plans to achieve these goals.<br />4.  Because the DRP sponsors different types of meetings the contractor needs experience in the organization of major international scientific meetings.<br />5.  To help judge the success of the individual research programs in the DRP, and the overall progress made by the program, the contractor needs experience in oversight and review of scientific programs in the NCI and elsewhere.<br />6.  Because the contactor will represent the DRP to the international AIDS research community, he/she needs sufficient international recognition and respect in the HIV/AIDS field to be able to communicate effectively with senior leaders within the NIH and elsewhere regarding collaboration, participation in scientific meetings, requests for advice, and the like.<br />7.  At least 20 years of postdoctoral experience and currently holding a senior position, equivalent to full Professor or Senior Scientist; extensive knowledge in the fields of retroviruses, HIV, and AIDS, as evidenced by more than 50 publications in these areas in peer-reviewed journals, as well awards and honors, and invitations to address national and international audiences. <br />8.  The contractor personnel shall be familiar with internationally recognized AIDS research programs and have knowledge of the HIV/AIDS research activities within the National Cancer Institute and the Center for Cancer Research, NCI. <br />9.  The contractor personnel shall have experience in the development, leadership, and management of major AIDS research programs.  <br />10.  The contractor personnel shall be a member of the National Academy of Sciences or other such organization and be highly respected in the field.  <br />11.

Further, a question requiring clarification is provided with the answer as follows. <BR><BR>QUESTION: MK 179 HE-ET projectile<BR><BR>In review of ADL 53711-7497398, it would appear that production of the MK 179 shells will in fact consist of renovating/converting existing 5/54 HE-MT/PD and HE-CVT HI-FRAG projectiles into the HE-ET configuration by simple removal of the existing fuze(s) and replacing with a new boostered MK 432 ET fuze along with repaint and marking.  So the production of this round does not appear to require actually loading projectiles with the main explosive charge of PBXN-106. <BR><BR>RESPONSE: The US Government has provided the ADL53711-6737421 and ADL53711-6256811 F. All associated drawings have also been provided. This will support contractor evaluation of production requirements for the round and fuze adapter. The US Government is seeking a manufacturing solution. Please use these ADLs in association with ADL 53711-7497398. Renovation proposals are not sought in this Market Survey.<BR><BR>3. Contractors are reminded that this Sources Sought for the 5 Inch 54 Navy Gun Munitions, Systems Acquisition under an IDIQ over a 5 year period from FY09 through FY13 is a SYSTEMS type.  All contractors are further reminded that they must respond to the Market Survey Questionnaire for the Interested Producers for this synopsis.  <BR><BR>Based on the above changes the response date is extended to 24 March 2009.

<a href="mailto:alissa.m.turner@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, New England</a>
<DESC>This modification changes the closing date of this Sources Sought Notice to Friday, March 6, 2009.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. <BR><BR><BR>	The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, is issuing this sources sought announcement to request submissions from companies that manufacture additives for bituminous highway paving mixtures as described.  The product process shall be a polymer additive which is added to a standard highway paving mix at the asphalt plant. When placed and compacted, the in-place pavement shall be such that the void space is reduced to the point at which the pavement is considered waterproof and a waterproofing membrane is not required, and the density is increased to the point at which potholes and rutting are minimized or totally eliminated.  Documentation of these properties shall be based on the product/process meeting the criteria of the following tests and requirements. <BR><BR>	Test for Fatigue Rating:  This test shall compare an unmodified AC-20 asphalt mix with a similar asphalt mix with the specific additive as part of the mix binder to assess fatigue resistance.  The samples shall be tested according to AASHTO TP8:  Standard Test Method for Determining the Fatigue Life of Compacted Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) Subjected to Repeated Flexural Bending.  The beam fatigue testing shall be conducted at a test temperature of 25C, a loading frequency of 5 Hertz, and a tensile strain level of 600 microstrains.  Samples shall be compacted to 7 plus or minus 1 percent air voids for testing.  Fatigue failure is defined as the number of fatigue cycles which correspond to a 50 percent reduction in the initial beam stiffness.  Results shall be considered to meet criteria, that is, shall be considered to have sufficient fatigue resistance, when each sample of the modified mix demonstrates a minimum fatigue resistance of 250,000 cycles at 25C and at least three times that of the unmodified AC-20 binder mix as determined by AASHTO TP 8.<BR><BR>	Test for Rut Resistance:  The objective of this test shall be to evaluate the rutting characteristics of the additive modified asphalt mixture under test wheel loadings at elevated temperatures.  Two types of hot mix asphalt mixtures shall be used:  one a neat AC-20 asphalt binder; and the second using the same AC-20 binder modified with the proposed additive.  The aggregate for both asphalt mixes shall be the same.  Three Marshall samples shall be prepared for each hot mix asphalt (HMA) per ASTM D1559, Resistance to Plastic Flow of Bituminous Mixtures Using Marshall Apparatus.  The compaction machine and procedures used for fabricating the asphalt beams shall be according to State of Georgia DOT GDT 115, Method of Test For Determining Rutting Susceptibility Using The Loaded Wheel Tester, Specifications.  The loaded wheel testing shall be also be performed according to Georgia DOT GDT 115.  Tests shall be performed at 40 C and 60 C.  Results shall be considered to meet criteria when the following values are met or exceeded:  the rut depth, in inches, for the AC-20 with additive sample is a maximum of half the value for the neat AC-20 sample.  The following minimum rut depths for the AC-20 with additive sample, tested at 40 C shall not exceed the following values:  for 1,000 cycles, a maximum rut depth of 0.04 inches; for 8,000 cycles, a maximum rut depth of 0.05 inches.  The following minimum rut depths for the AC-20 with additive sample, tested at 60 C shall not exceed the following values:  for 1,000 cycles, a maximum rut depth of 0.15 inches; for 8,000 cycles, a maximum rut depth of 0.20 inches. <BR><BR>	Test for Resistance to Chloride Ion Penetration:  This test shall measure the resistance of a concrete specimen with an asphalt coating containing the special additive binder applied to its surface to the penetration of chloride ion.  Testing shall be performed in general accordance with AASHTO T259, Resistance of Concrete to Chloride Ion Penetration.  Four concrete test specimens shall be made and cured according to AASHTO T126, Making and Curing Concrete Test Specimens in the Laboratory.  Each slab shall be not less than 3 thick and 12 square.  The specimens shall be moist cured for 14 days and placed in a drying room for 7 days according to AASHTO T160, Length Change of Hardened Hydraulic Cement Mortar and Concrete.  Each specimen shall then be removed from the drying room and be coated with a standard highway asphalt mix with additive contained in the binder.  When the specimens have cooled to ambient temperature, they shall be returned to the drying room for 7 days.  At that time, they shall be removed from the drying room, 0.75 high by 0.5 wide dams shall be built around the top edges of three of the four specimens, and returned to the drying room for a final 14 days.  The fourth specimen shall be the control.  The degree of saturation of the specimens at the time of ponding will affect the chloride ingress, i.e., water saturated concrete will absorb significantly less chlorides than a drier, but similar material.  Thus, for proper definition of chloride ingress, the requirements for a total of 28 days drying time must be strictly adhered to.  At the end of the drying period, 42 days, three of the four specimens shall be subjected to continuous ponding with a three percent sodium chloride solution approximately 0.5 inches deep for ninety days.  Glass plates shall be placed over the dams to retard evaporation of the solution and the specimens placed in the drying room for a ninety day period.  After 90 days of exposure, the solution shall be removed from the specimen, the specimens shall be allowed to dry, and all salt crystal build up shall be removed from the surfaces. Samples shall then be taken from depths of 0.0625 inches to 0.5 inches, and from 0.5 inches to 1.0 inches per AASHTO T259.  The chloride content shall then be determined for each sample in accordance with AASHTO T260.  Results shall be considered to satisfy criteria, negligible transmission of chloride ions, when either no sample exceeds 0.03 percent chlorides, or no sample exceeds the percent chloride in the control by greater than 0.01 percent.<BR><BR>	Test for Impermeability:  This test shall consist of preparing and testing compacted hot mix samples employing the specific additive in accordance with ASTM D 5084, Measurement of Hydraulic Conductivity of Saturated Porous Materials Using a Flexible Wall Permeameter.  Results shall be considered to meet criteria, asphalt pavement samples are essentially impermeable, when the hydraulic conductivity of each sample is equal to or less than 10 to the minus eighth power cm per sec.<BR><BR>	Test for Resilient Modulus:  This test shall consist of preparing and testing laboratory-prepared Hot Mix Asphalt samples using the proposed additive as an integral part of the binder to determine resilient modulus of elasticity at varying temperatures.  All testing shall be in accordance with ASTM D 4123, Indirect Tension Test for Resilient Modulus of Bituminous Mixtures.  Results shall be considered to satisfy criteria when the modulus of elasticity of all samples equals or exceed 200,000 pounds per square inch at a test temperature of 25 C.<BR><BR>	Test Values for Proposed Additive and Asphalt Binder Only: The following tests shall be performed on the proposed additive and asphalt binder, according to the referenced test methods indicated.  Nominal required values are listed also.  The Performance Grade Test per AASHTO MP1 shall produce a nominal result of PG 94 34.  The Dynamic Shear Ratio Test per AASHTO TP5 shall produce a nominal result of 1.034 kPa at 118 C.  The Creep Stiffness Test per AASHTO TP3 shall produce a nominal result of 90 Mpa at minus 24 C.  The Elastic Recovery Test per ASTM D6084 shall produce a nominal result of 92 percent at 10 C.  The Force Ratio Test per AASHTO T300 shall produce a nominal result of 0.99.  The Toughness Test per ASTM D5801 shall produce a nominal result of 210 inch pounds.  The Tenacity Test per ASTM D5801 shall produce a nominal result of 140 inch pounds.  Results shall be considered to satisfy criteria if all test result values fall within 5 percent of the nominal values listed above.<BR><BR>	Interested manufacturers shall submit written specifications, catalog cuts, and 3 customer references with greater than three years successful field installation of the product.  Firm shall indicate business classification size (e.g. 8(a), HUBZone, etc.). The NAICS Code is 324121 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  Responses are required no later than 6 March 2009.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  Alissa Turner.  Firms interested shall provide the above documentation, in one original form and one copy.  The government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.<BR>

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
