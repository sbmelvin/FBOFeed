<SUBJECT>B -- NEUTRAL BUOYANCY RECOVERY DEVICE PATENT LICENSING OPPORTUNITY
<SOLNBR>003
<RESPDATE>043002
<ARCHDATE>05152002
<CONTACT>Willard Webster, Technical Rep, Phone (760) 939- 1074, Email websterwp@navair.navy.mil - Dave Eiband, Technical Rep, Phone (760) 939-0423, Email eibanddm@navair.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is seeking potential commercial partners to license a patent that describes a neutral buoyancy recovery device (NBRD) that should have direct application for safe rescue of injured or incapacitated swimmers from swimming pools or other water environments.  NAWCWD recently received a notice of allowance from the US Patent and Trademark Office for a patent application for said neutral buoyancy recovery device and anticipates the imminent issue of a patent for said invention.  The NBRD for retrieving an immobile object or incapacitated individual from a liquid pool utilizes neutral buoyancy to assist a rescuer and help protect the retrieved object or individual from further injury.  Because it is initially neutrally buoyant, the NBRD can be easily submerged under the surface of the liquid and safely placed under the object or individual to be recovered or rescued.  One or more bladders integral to the NBRD can be inflated to create positive buoyancy when desired and when safe to do so, thus causing the NBRD and the object (or individual) mounted on the NBRD to rise and float on the liquid surface.  The inflatable bladder(s) is located in a space between two panels integral to the NBRD.  The bladder(s) may be inflated manually or by using compressed gas canisters.  Various straps and ropes can be used to stabilize the object or individual as the NBRD is maneuvered on the surface of the liquid.  Standard water rescue backboards are always positively buoyant and require that the backboard be forced underneath the victim to overcome the positive buoyant force, thus opening up the opportunity for additional serious injury, particularly when back or neck injuries or bone fractures are involved.  In addition, smaller rescuers have difficulty overcoming the standard rescue backboard?s positive buoyancy and therefore cannot complete the rescue.  When used as a water rescue device, the primary advantage of this invention over standard water rescue backboards is that the board is initially neutrally buoyant and thus can be easily and safely positioned under an incapacitated or injured swimmer before inflating and floating the NBRD rescue board, thus greatly reducing the possibility of unnecessarily causing additional serious injury due to the rescue process itself.  If necessary, once the rescued swimmer is safely aboard the NBRD, the swimmer can be further physically stabilized and protected against further injury with straps, splints, and cushions before the NBRD, with rescued swimmer aboard, is extracted from the water.  A large potential market for this invention is anticipated to be public swimming pools and commercial water craft that have a real need to be able and ready to rescue injured or incapacitated swimmers or accident victims from a water environment while at the same time minimizing the potential for further serious injury caused by the rescue process itself.  Companies involved in the manufacture and sale of water safety and rescue devices and systems should have interest in this licensing opportunity.  Parties potentially interested in licensing this technology for commercial sale or desiring additional information about this invention or the Navy?s patent licensing process itself should contact the NAWCWD China Lake Technology Transfer Office at the address listed below on or before April 30, 2002.  The objectives of the Navy Domestic Technology Transfer Program are: (1) to disseminate technology originally developed in support of military applications for alternative uses in the public and private sectors; (2) to provide joint cooperative development programs that address problems of critical concern to the Navy and other agencies or organizations; and (3) to leverage research and development opportunities of mutual interest to the Navy and industrial organizations.  In pursuit of these objectives, the Navy transfers technology to other Federal Government agencies, state and local governments, small and large United States businesses, nonprofit organizations and such public service organizations as schools, hospitals and foundations.  Under the Navy Domestic Technology Transfer Program, the Government is permitted to receive funds from a non-Federal party.  However, the Government is not permitted to fund a non-Federal party.  For more information contact Dr. Willard P. Webster of the Technology Transfer Office, Code 4T1100D, at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA 93555-6100, telephone: (760) 939-1074.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an RFB or RFP; it is not a commitment by the Government, and does not guarantee any future contracts to be let by the Government.  Participation in this announcement is strictly voluntary and does not in any way suggest, imply, or impose a U.S. Government obligation or guarantee for future contractual related services, agreements, or other considerations.

Quoters are herein requested to submit written price quotations and technical capabilities/experience information for conducting two audience surveys as outlined below SECTION A: Nature of Surveys.  Audience data shall be obtained through survey of Amman, Jordan.  The first survey shall be conducted as early as possible in March, 2002; the second shall be conducted around September, 2002.  The surveys shall be designed to measure the present audience for VOA programming and the change in the audience following the introduction of a new programming initiative, presently scheduled for late March or early April of this year.  Both surveys shall also collect basic information on the overall media use patterns and attitudes of the population of interest.  The interviewing shall be face-to-face and conducted in the home of the respondent by a trained interviewer. 1) General Responsibilities of the Contractor.  The contractor shall be responsible for the project design including the following specific task: a) translation, formatting, pretesting, adaptation, and printing of IBB supplied questionnaires; b) developing the sampling plan; c) training interviewers; d) supervising fieldwork; e) cleaning and encoding survey responses; f) entering and processing the data; g) ascertaining the representativeness of the sample and weighting the data, if necessary; g) preparing cross-tabulations in data books; h) submitting data on diskette; i) and communicating all necessary information and results to IBB in a timely manner. 2) Sample Design.  Interested quoters are herein requested to submit price quotations for two surveys, each with a samples of 1,000 adults age 15 or older and  representative of the population of greater Amman.  The precise area to be covered by the surveys shall be jointly determined by IBB and the contractor (awardee) for this project.  If necessary, weights shall be derived and applied to the survey data by the contractor in order to bring the sample into conformity with the characteristics of the entire population.  The sample shall be drawn using recognized probability methods, all the way down to the selection of the individual respondent at the household level.  Only one individual per household shall be selected, and at least three attempts shall be made to interview selected respondents before substitution is allowed.  A detailed Sampling Plan, including stratification criteria, description of the sampling frame, listing of anticipated Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), approximate number of interviews in each, procedures for selecting households within PSUs, and procedures for selecting individual respondents at the household level, shall be submitted to and approved by IBB prior to commencement of any fieldwork.  3) Questionnaire.  IBB will supply a set of questions for an interview of approximately 30 minutes consisting of approximately 50 questions (in English), up to 5 of which may be open-ended.  The questionnaire will be provided in draft form for suggestions and comments by the contractor. Following receipt of the contractor's comments, IBB will provide a final version of the questionnaire for translation by the contractor into Arabic. The contractor shall prepare translation of the questionnaire in Arabic and shall submit these translations to IBB for approval prior to pre-test.  The contractor shall be responsible for compiling a comprehensive list of both local and international broadcast media available in the areas to be surveyed.  This information shall be used to compile a precoded list of stations on the survey and shall be submitted to IBB for approval prior to finalization of the questionnaire.  Following IBB's review of any contractor comments and final approval of translations of questionnaires, the contractor shall prepare final versions in English and other languages as agreed in form suitable for use by interviewers.  4) Pre-test.  The questionnaire shall be pre-tested by the contractor prior to the commencement of any fieldwork.  At least 25 pre-test interviews shall be conducted.

Fieldwork for the first survey shall commence on or about the first week in March 2002, and shall be completed by about the middle of that month.  It is anticipated that the second survey shall take place in September 2002; however, that date may be changed due to programming considerations.  Interviews shall be conducted by experienced field workers who shall be thoroughly briefed by the contractor prior to commencement of any work.  The contractor shall ensure that interviewers are thoroughly familiar with household and respondent selection procedures, call back procedures, and the structure of the questionnaire, including routing and filtering.  Interviewer training shall include practice sessions in administering the questionnaire.  A minimum of 10% of interviews shall be back checked and 5% shall be accompanied by a team supervisor.  The contractors' proposals shall include a description of the professional qualifications of the proposed interviewers and a description of the training that shall be provided to interviewers. 6) Data Processing.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) intends to issue a simplified acquisition for base year and four (4) option years for the purpose of obtaining support services to advise on the development of an enterprise-wide integrated information technology architecture.  BPD has published an initial baseline architecture document with several subsequent updates.  A formalized governance process was adopted in January 2001.  Subsequently, a conceptual architecture was developed containing architectural principles, new technology components such as new email software, a directory services architecture, and a JAVA development framework.  Many of these components have now been successfully implemented.  BPD now wants to build upon its current architectural successes and continue to improve its program objectives including the development of a ?to be? architecture, the conduction of gap analyses to determine how we move from our ?as-is? architecture to our ?to-be? architecture.  BPD?s architectural documentation contains sensitive information and cannot be released during the solicitation phase, however, all relevant architecture documents will be released to the contractor once an award is made.  In addition, BPD wants to ensure that its architecture is in complience with Federal Laws and Regulations.  BPD intends to coordinate the creation of an enterprise-wide integrated information technology architecture using Treasury?s Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF) as guidance to document the relationship between BPD goals and functions, information requirements, applications, data structures, and technology base.   The TEAF is available electronically at the following URL:  hhtp://www.treas.gov/teaf/ .  The solication should be released on or about 02-11-02.  We will post the solicitation to FedBizOpps when it is released.

<DESC>The United States Department of Education seeks capability statements from small businesses, as well as comments from all interested parties, on the proposed acquisition synopsized below and fully outlined in the attached draft SOW (follow link below this synopsis).

The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) in the U.S. Department of Education expects to request proposals for the development and maintenance of the What Works Clearinghouse.  The Clearinghouse will document what works in education in multiple topic areas, providing a national registry of educational interventions.   More specifically, it will be an easily accessible and searchable, web-based online database of products, programs, and practices that are claimed to enhance student academic outcomes.  Claims of effectiveness will be assessed with respect to the quality, quantity, and relevance of evidence, as well as the magnitude of effects of interventions -- as determined through reviews of research.  It will also include a registry of evaluators who are prepared to conduct evaluation studies that will meet high quality standards as determined by the Clearinghouse.  

A core expectation of the Department is that the interventions in the  registry can be successfully adopted by a significant number of educational practitioners throughout the nation.  Therefore the system designed under the contract must ensure that listings in the registry have high potential for transportability to many other settings.  

The Department anticipates that major tasks will include: 

1) developing and implementing a communication and collaboration strategy; 2) creating and supporting an expert technical advisory group to give feedback to the contractor; 3) developing standards and criteria for conducting study reviews and preparing evidence reports; 4) creating and maintaining a registry of evaluators committed to the Clearinghouse standards and criteria; 5) 
identifying topic areas for broader evidence-based research reviews, and for test instrument reviews (optional); 6) 
conducting reviews of effectiveness studies and preparing evidence reports; 7) conducting special ?fast track? reviews and syntheses (optional); 8) developing and supporting a web-based online system and databases.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS.  The Department is placing this notice to solicit questions and comments and begin an exchange of information with the public in order to release the best possible solicitation.  All interested parties should read the draft SOW by following the link below.

Capability statements from small businesses, as well as comments from all interested parties, should be submitted to Nicole Ragno, Contract Specialist, at Nicole.Ragno@ed.gov by 12:00 pm on Thursday, February 7, 2002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Counter Underground Facilities Unattended Ground Sensor System Initiatives SOL BAA 02-04 proposals, POC: Dr. Dan Cress, Program Manager, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714.  Facsimile: (703) 696-2203, E-mail: baa02-04@darpa-mil (email contact preferred).  Contractual point of contact: DARPA Contracts Management Office (CMO), Attn: Ms. Kristen Numrych, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714.  

OBJECTIVE: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO) is soliciting proposals (technical and cost) and white papers from qualified contractors for the assessment and development of Counter Underground Facility (CUGF) technology.  Underground facilities (UGFs) are a serious and growing asymmetric threat to national security and operational dominance.  The purpose of this BAA is to fund research and development efforts to enhance DoD's capabilities for enabling either functional or physical defeat of specific UGFs and securing information for battle damage assessment.  This BAA solicits responses in two discrete work areas.  In Work Area 1, full proposals are solicited to develop and demonstrate a functional (non-form factored) prototype ground sensor system for monitoring critical activities and for localizing vulnerabilities for facility attack.  The sensor system includes sensors, local communications, and algorithms.  For the demonstrated system, all sensor and communication nodes are hand-emplaced; the sensitivities of the sensors are clutter limited.  The focus is on monitoring and localization of power and ventilation systems. The system will exploit, but not be restricted to passive acoustic, seismic, and electromagnetic (PASEM) observables.  In Work Area 2, this BAA solicits innovative methods and/or designs for detection and exploitation of UGF-related observables in situations ranging from the tactical use of caves to strategic-level UGFs.  Areas of interest include novel sensors, exploitation algorithms, signal processing, and sensor system planning, deployment, communications, and modeling. 

ACQUISITION INFORMATION: Work Area 1 solicits qualified offerors (teams are encouraged) to submit proposals for the development, demonstration, and delivery of a complete functional prototype ground sensor system that includes, but is not limited to, passive seismic, acoustic, and electromagnetic (PASEM) observables.  Proposals are due 17 May 2002.  It is anticipated that Work Area 1 proposals will be classified.  Work Area 2 solicits white papers from the widest number of offerors, including qualified corporations, research centers, universities, FFRDCs, and DOE laboratories.  Work Area 2 white papers or proposals will be accepted for consideration up to 24 months from the date of this BAA announcement. Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.106, this announcement and the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) constitute DARPA's solicitation for this BAA. 

A technical evaluation of all proposals will be accomplished through a review of each proposal considering the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: (1) innovative and creative technical approaches; (2) understanding of the technical issues and risks; (3) soundness of the technical and management approach; (4) offeror's relevant experience, facilities and availability of qualified, experienced technical personnel; (5) organization, clarity and thoroughness of the proposal.  Cost reasonableness and realism will be assessed, but this assessment is of lower priority than the technical evaluation.  Specific criteria for each category of document, i.e., proposal or white paper, can be found in the PIP.  Two awards are anticipated for Work Area 1, while multiple awards are anticipated for Work Area 2.  Toward this end, DARPA will consider all types of proposals including traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and Other Transaction Agreements.  No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of the solicited tasks for exclusive competition among the entries.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: Proposals must be submitted in accordance with the PIP.  Proposals that do not meet the specified format described in the PIP will not be considered for award. A classified PIP is available to offerors meeting security requirements for Work Areas 1 and 2; requirements for obtaining a copy of this PIP are described below.  For Work Area 2, an unclassified version of the PIP addressing general innovative methods is available; selected topics are not included in the unclassified PIP.  For offerors submitting an unclassified proposal or white paper for Work Area 2, the unclassified PIP is sufficient.  A copy may be requested by following the directions provided at the BAA web site, http://www.darpa.mil/spo/solicitations.htm.

Offerors may obtain a classified Compact Disk (CD) containing the classified PIP and the DARPA CUGF Security Classification Guide (SCG) 183 by faxing their facility clearance level, Defense Security Services CAGE code and classified mailing address to Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), fax number (703) 524-2449 (Attn: Ms. Mary Thomson/BAA 02-04).  Please identify the specific information being requested and the name and telephone number of the requester.   

Work Area 1. There will be a SECRET/NOFORN Briefing to Offerors covering Work Area 1 on or about 27 February 2002.  Additional Government-furnished Data will be provided on or about 10 April 2002.  The briefing dates, starting times and specific locations will be posted on the BAA Website.  All interested parties must have a current visitor request and security clearance on file with DARPA in order to attend these briefings.  Visitor requests and security clearances should be mailed to 4001 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 650, Arlington, VA 22203, Attn: Ms. Mary Thomson; or faxed to (703) 524-2449 (Attn: Ms. Mary Thomson/baa).  Offerors responding to Work Area 1 of this BAA will submit a full proposal and make a two-hour oral presentation.  Proposals for Work Area 1 are expected to be classified SECRET/NOFORN in accordance with SCG 183 and must be double wrapped with the outer wrapping address to DARPA/SPO, 3701 N. Fairfax  Drive, Arlington, VA 22203, ATTN: BAA 02-04/Document Control.  The inner envelope should include the same street address and be marked to the ATTN: Dr. Dan Cress.  All proposals for Work Area 1 must be received by 4:00 p.m. (EDT) on 17 May 2002.  Proposals submitted by fax or electronic mail will not be considered.  Unclassified questions regarding this BAA or PIP must be sent to baa02-04@darpa.mil.  A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) compilation including DARPA responses will be posted on the BAA Website every Friday for the time period between the Briefing to Offerors and the deadline for submission of proposals.  Other postings may be made as deemed appropriate.  Awards are anticipated during May 2002.  A table of important dates and milestones is provided in the PIP.  

Work Area 2. White papers are encouraged.  White papers or proposals will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.  There is no predetermined schedule for submissions or for granting awards.  Submissions are encouraged as early as possible.  This work area will be left open for 24 months after BAA publication. The first round of evaluations will take place beginning on or about 45 days after BAA publication.  Unclassified white papers or proposals should be mailed to DARPA, 3701 N. Fairfax, Drive, Arlington, VA 22203, ATTN: Dr. Dan Cress/BAA 02-04.  Offerors anticipating submittal of classified white papers or proposals under Work Area 2 should request the classified PIP and SCG 183 as per the procedure presented above.  The classified white paper or proposal must be mailed in accordance with the procedure identified for Work Area 1 proposals.  Following the Work Area 1 briefing on or about 27 February 2002, there will be a SECRET/NOFORN Briefing to Offerors for Work Area 2 that will cover selected areas of specific interest.  All interested parties must have a current visitor request and security clearance on file with DARPA in order to attend these briefings.  Visitor requests and security clearances should be mailed to 4001 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 650, Arlington, VA 22203, Attn: Ms. Mary Thomson; or faxed to (703) 524-2449 (Attn: Ms. Mary Thomson/baa). Unclassified questions regarding Work Area 2 and this BAA or PIP must be sent to baa02-04@darpa.mil.  FAQs for Work Area 2 will be updated as appropriate and posted on the BAA Website.  Work Area 2 awards will be made on an individual basis throughout the duration of the BAA.  

The government shall not be liable for the cost of proposal preparation or submission.  Proposals submitted shall be in accordance with this announcement and the PIP.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.

ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Each cost proposal shall contain a section addressing the following: Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section.

It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  The Government intends to use non-government personnel as special resources to assist with the logistics of administering the proposal evaluation and providing selected technical assistance related to proposal evaluation.  Support personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose.  Contractor personnel are required to sign the Organizational Conflict of Interest Non-Disclosure Agreements.  By submission of its proposal, each offeror agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above.  Any information not intended for limited release to support contractors must be clearly marked and segregated from other submitted proposal material.

<DESC>NA Research and Development in Illicit Drug Demand Reduction and Support. The U.S. Army White Sands Missile Range, Electronic Proving Ground, Counterdrug Office, Fort Huachuca, AZ 85613-7110 in support of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Cou nterdrug Technology Assessment Center (CTAC) is soliciting proposals for innovative research and development projects to reduce the demand for illicit drugs and other substances of abuse. The intent of this Broad Area Announcement (BAA) is to identify appl ications of medical technologies that enhance our National capabilities to meet the strategic Demand Reduction goals of ONDCP (see web site: www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov ).  These initiatives will complement those of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (N IDA) (see web sire: www.nida.nih.gov ), in the improvement,  installation, and use of the investigative tools and instruments, available for research scientists and engineers to explore and understand the underlying causes of substance abuse, dependence, a nd addiction on which to develop effective assessment, prevention, and treatment programs. Areas of Interest: This BAA focuses on science and technology-based initiatives that will contribute to the development and applications of technology to support: dr ug abuse prevention and treatment research, enhancement of our understanding of the effects of drugs on the body, understanding genetics based aspects of drug addiction and susceptibility, and using statistical data base methods for assessing and monitorin g drug addiction. Major areas of interest are: 1. Infrastructure for Research and Validation of Technology: a. Expansion of advanced neuroimaging research systems and facilities and training opportunities for research teams dedicated to studies of drug abu se. Included are high-resolution positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, ultra-high energy fields for the imaging of animals, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, brain scan image processing and interpretation, molecular chemistry and assay systems, and related noninvasive support technologies.  Selected infrastructure research initiatives are to contribute to systems development and implementation to image the drug's metabolic and chemical processes, map brain reward circuitry, loc alize active areas of the brain, measurement of blood volume and flow associated with drug metabolism, and analysis of interactions with potential therapeutic medicines. b. Validation of infrastructure enhancement efforts toward contributing to the foundat ion for key research issues. Examples include research such as the curtailment of drug-induced adaptive behavior, pharmacological phenomena and neurochemical effects relating to sensitization and tolerance, impulsivity and risk-taking behavioral traits, cu e induced craving, significance of various motivational rewards, effects of sleep disturbance, and the effects and degree of genetic contributions to drug use and addiction. 2. Bioinformatics and Research Data: a. Information systems for relating gene expr ession and functional bioinformatics to positional information and the biochemical or functional pathway to identify correlation with the genetic predisposition to abused drugs, genomic variables associated with responses to drugs, and possible relationshi ps to known linkages with drug abuse; with the goal of understanding the entire complex chemistry and circuitry of the brain, and how this circuitry is altered under conditions of drug abuse. b.

<DESC>THE PREPROPOSAL CONFERENCE AND SITE VISIT, ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 28,2002, HAS BEEN POSTPONED INDEFINITELY.  THE ISSUE DATE FOR THE SOLICITATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON A DATE TO BE DETERMINED. END OF MODIFICATION.


In conjunction with the General Services Administration, the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings and the intent to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Construction Services for The United States Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) and related work in and around the Capitol Building, Washington, DC. The CVC will greatly enhance the experience of visiting the U.S. Capitol building. Not only will it provide new educational opportunities for visitors but it will also improve security, accessibility and visitor comfort. As designed, the CVC will complement the Capitol building and its surroundings and will become a seamless addition to the Capitol complex. The CVC will be located underground on the East Front of the Capitol, so as to enhance rather than detract from the appearance of the Capitol and its historic Frederick Law Olmsted landscaping. When completed, the CVC will contain approximately 580,000 square feet on three levels, requiring approximately a 196,000-square-foot excavation, or "footprint," on the East Front of the Capitol. The CVC will include space for exhibits, visitor comfort, food service, two orientation theaters, an auditorium, gift shops, security, connections to existing buildings, service tunnels for underground vehicle access to the Capitol, loading docks, mechanical facilities, and storage. The CVC will preserve and maximize public access to the Capitol while greatly enhancing the experience for the millions who walk its historic corridors and experience its monumental spaces every year. This solicitation will address only a portion of the work required to complete the CVC, as noted below. The Architect of the Capitol will utilize a ?best value? source selection process to enable selection from among high quality contractors for this procurement. The project will be constructed in sequences and requires extensive coordination between this contractor and contractors of prior and subsequent sequences of the work as well as with contractors performing other AOC projects in the immediate vicinity of the project. This advertisement is for SEQUENCE 1B of the project which includes, but is not limited to, CONCRETE STRUCTURE INCLUDING SLAB ON METAL DECK AND THE WORKING SLAB BELOW THE SITE PAVERS, STEEL STRUCTURE, WATERPROOFING, ELEVATOR HOLES, AND TUNNELS INCLUDING THE TRUCK TUNNEL TO NEW JERSEY AVENUE, THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS TUNNEL, THE HOUSE CONNECTOR TUNNEL AND THE UTILITY TUNNEL OUT EAST CAPITOL STREET.  The estimated construction cost for SEQUENCE 1B is in the range of $40 to $55 million. The Contractor must provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided), and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet AOC requirements. The Contractor will perform the construction in accordance with the design specifications, drawings, and the provisions of the contract. The solicitation for Sequence IB will be issued in two (2) phases. Phase I will be for technical proposals and will include a set of draft specifications and drawings. It will be available on or about 01/21/2002. UNDER THIS PHASE THE GOVERNMENT WILL EVALUATE PAST PERFORMANCE, TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED OF THEIR TECHNICAL STANDING PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF PHASE II, WHICH WILL BE A REQUEST FOR OFFERORS OF HIGH TECHNICAL STANDING TO SUBMIT PRICING PROPOSALS BASED UPON COMPLETED SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS. Phase II of the solicitation will be issued approximately 45 days after receipt of proposals for Phase I. The government will award a fixed-price contract after evaluation of Phase I and Phase II proposals resulting from this solicitation to the responsive and responsible offeror determined by the government to be the ?best value? to the government. Under this solicitation, Technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price, but no specific numerical weight will be assigned to price for evaluation purposes. The contract documents will also specify the methodology for negotiating change orders. Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15. Offerors are advised an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received. The government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the government to be the most advantageous to the government. Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms. NOTE: Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for proposal preparation costs. To be considered for final award, potential offeror must submit proposals per the RFP to BOTH the Technical/Management/Past Performance and Price on the due dates established. A pre-proposal meeting and site visit will be held on January 28th at 10:00 AM at the Library of Congress, Thomas Jefferson Building, Room 119, Washington, DC. The RFP Phase I will be issued by the Contract Specialist at GSA, Mid Atlantic Region in Philadelphia, PA, and posted electronically on the www.fedbizops.gov website. Hard copies of the draft specifications and drawings and RFP Phase II, Technical Specifications and Drawings will be issued by the AOC, Washington, DC. In order for potential offerors to be placed on the bidders list for hard copies, respondents must submit a written request via fax to Cal Durgin, (202) 228-2073 or e-mailed to cdurgin@aoc.gov. Requests from prime contractors must include a letter from the surety stating their capacity for bonding in amounts covering the estimated prices cited above. Any questions regarding this synopsis may be directed to Cal Durgin, CVC Contract Specialist, at (202) 228-2370 or Dan Correnti, GSA Contract Specialist, at (215) 656-6152. This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAIC code 233320.

<DESC>Sources Sought.  The Information Exploitation Systems (SRG) Program Office seeks to upgrade the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) with a common Geospatial Information System (GIS) software application capable of performing multiple functions utilizing multiple sources of data for a wide range of users.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only for a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software tool to provide the core capabilities of the GIS application. The AF DCGS is a system of systems that supports intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  It tasks ISR assets, ingests data from multiple satellite-, airborne-, and ground-based sensors, processes and exploits the data, and disseminates intelligence products.  Currently, the AF DCGS is comprised of multiple legacy systems at multiple locations worldwide that utilize various commercial and Government GIS applications and map products.  The Government is seeking to standardize on a single application at all sites.  The ideal core GIS application tool will, at a minimum: ·	Display data stored in various formats including, but not limited to, Compressed ARC Digital Raster Graphic (CADRG), ARC Digital Raster Imagery (ADRI), Controlled Image Base (CIB), Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF), geospatial reports, tailored geospatial products supplied by the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) and other agencies, vector/raster data, specialized image/map graphics, and precision points; ·	Convert latitude (LAT), longitude (LONG), geopositional reference (GEOREF), Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), or Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) grid coordinates to data link reference point (DLRP) or to XY coordinates without impacting the originating source and vice versa; ·	Display data in layers that can be selectively added to or removed from a monitor dynamically upon operator command; ·	Provide a documented interface that facilitates the rapid infusion of additional data sources including image libraries, feature databases and reports databases; ·	Support generation of softcopy and hardcopy multi-INT products including, but not limited to, hardcopy tailored images, textual reports, magnetic media, multi-media and graphics; ·	Support the dynamic posting of geospatial data to web servers; ·	Operate in both a UNIX and Windows environments; ·	Be scalable to support a diverse user base. Interested potential offerors are requested to submit a statement of their qualifications and supporting documentation, including cost of software application, customer base, and experience providing such products.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute and IFB or an RFP, nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.

<DESC>Miami, Florida, New Construction, United State District Courthouse, Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session.

On Tuesday, February 19, 2002, the United States General Services Administration (GSA), with conduct a Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session for prospective small business sub-contractors for the construction phase of the new United States District Courthouse in Miami, Florida.  The Networking Session will be from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.(local time) at the Sheraton Biscayne Bay Hotel, 495 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida.

The facility to be constructed will be occupied by the U.S. District Court, Office of the U.S. Attorney, the U.S. Marshals Service, and General Services Administration (GSA).  The magnitude of construction is $105,000,000 and $115,000,000.  All construction disciplines are expected to be represented on this project.

The Subcontracting Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA?s recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the firms which have been short-listed as the prospective prime contractor on this project.

Prospective small business subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with the short-listed contractors and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors.  Because GSA is not permitted to become involved in contractual relationships between prime and subcontractors, any contracts that may develop between potential primes and subcontractors as a result of this Networking Session will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Networking Session may be directed to either David Gibson, GSA?s Public Buildings Service Small Business Liaison for this project, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV; or Pat Geisinger, GSA?s Small Business Technical Advisor, Office of Enterprise Development, Telephone (404) 331-3031, E-Mail Pat.Geisinger@GSA.GOV.

Notice:  While we strongly encourage and desire attendance of all interested parties, space is not unlimited.  Attendees will be accommodated on a first come, first serve basis.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI).  The information received will be used in assessing the availability of carriers to perform Charter International Airlift Cargo service for the Department of Defense (DOD) and to develop the method to procure the requirement.  In order to receive an award, the offeror must be a member of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). At the present time, the Government contemplates 7 routes only in the Pacific Region, but during the course of the contract period, may request service in the Atlantic Region or other regions of the world.  The Government is requesting support to include a minimum of 6 but not more than 10 each 463L pallet positions (108 inches L x 88 inches W x 96 inches H).  The pallets must support a minimum of 3,000 pounds.   Although the Government prefers non-contoured pallets, the Government will consider aircraft requiring contoured pallets.  Additionally, the Government finds the ability to accept pallet trains more desirable than individual pallet load capability.  The Government is considering soliciting for this service on a 'Best Value' basis, trading off service capabilities against price.   Awards are planned to made on an ?all or none? basis to one offeror vice multiple awards made to several offers such as awarding by routes.  Please provide your commercial method of pricing charters to include how delays, diversions, cancellations, and ferry miles are handled.  We also request comments on limitations of providing service to other regions, including pricing of such service, should the need arise.  In addition, please identify what recourse a customer has when delivery is delayed or carrier fails to perform.  Please provide any additional comments you think may assist this office in developing this requirement.  Pending outcome of the RFI results, performance is estimated to begin on or after 1 Oct 02.  This RFI should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of such a procurement.  This agency is interested in obtaining responses to this RFI from prospective contractors but no contractor shall be reimbursed for providing this information; therefore, the Air Force will accept the requested information in whatever format is provided.  All information provided by the contractor will become the property of the Air Force and will not be returned.  Responses on the proposed strategy and questions are required no later than close of business on 01 Feb 02.

<DESC>NA The Government requires a System Integrator and Service Provider for the management of the Appliqué Computers, and related System Integration and Support Services, as a part of the Force Twenty-One, Battle Command, Brigade and Below (FBCB2) System.  The go vernment intends to acquire approximately 1,500 to 3,000 Appliqué computers per year, and the platform unique installation kits, installation services, training, site operations, field support and maintenance of these systems. The Appliqué computer is a ru ggedized computer system, which consists of a CPU Unit, a display unit, a removeable Hard Disk Drive and detachable Keyboard unit.  The CPU should contain a current year technology processor,  a minimum of 512 MB of RAM, minimum 10 GB removeable Hard Drive  and a full complement of I/O ports and interfaces.  The display unit is a minimum 256 color LCD with a minimum 800 x 600 pixel resolution.  The display has an internal touchscreen capability, and is fully sunlight readable in bright sunshine, with brightn ess level that is gradually adjustable from full brightness to total blackout conditions for night time operations. The Keyboard unit uses a standard 84 key QWERTY layout, which is hot pluggable into the Display unit. It also incorporates backlight of keys , which provides the user a range of brightness adjustments and full blackout capabilities. The computer system must be capable of running the Solaris X.86 version 8.0 operating system and FBCB2 application software version.  A detailed performance specifi cation can be provided upon request to the Government POCs.  The Government POCs are Major Eric Piatt, 732-427-4061 and Mr. Joseph Hill, 732-427-2862.   This effort is anticipated to begin in November 2002 and is a five-year effort.  This acquisition for t he PM Force Twenty-One, Battle Command, Brigade and Below (FBCB2) is to continue the ongoing Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) effort, to continue to implement the Army’s objective of digitizing the battlefield, and may transition to become the Full Rate Production (FRP) contract for the program.   This procurement is subject to Full and Open competition.  TRW, Tactical Systems, Systems and Information Technology Group, Carson, CA is the incumbent on the initial LRIP effort which ends January 2003. TRW is the software developer under a separate Systems Engineering and Integration contract.  The subcontracted computer manufacturers are Northup-Grumman located in San Diego, California and Paravant located in Melbourne, Florida.  The contract will be an IDIQ c ontract consisting of a five-year effort, spanning the 2003- 2008 years.  The contract type is expected to be Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) for the hardware and selected services, FFP for data and appropriate services, with T&M for selected support services and tasks. This contract will be awarded to a System Integrator and Service provider, who will take the most current version of GFE FBCB2 software, load it onto either subcontracted or GFE computer hardware, install on various platforms and perform the sup port services as required at various site locations.  To mitigate the Government’s risk in the area of hardware production, the first two years of this effort will be performed using computer hardware that is to be produced by one of the successful initial  subcontracted LRIP manufacturers.  The System Integrator and Service provider will conduct a competition for a potential second source of computer hardware using a government coordinated performance specification during the first year of this effort, comp lete a first article qualification and reliability test prior to a source selection.  The second year of the effort the computer buy may be 75% awarded to the successful LRIP manufacturer, with the winner of the source selection potentially subject up to 2 5% of this years buy.  During the remaining years of the procurement, the System Integrator and Service Provider may determine the computer hardware source.   A ward is anticipated in November 2002, with initial deliveries of computer hardware in June 2003, with support services, training and site operations beginning in January 2003.  Installation schedules will be established yearly, with site operations anticip ated at Ft Hood, Ft Lewis and other locations.  Respondents should specifically address their capability to provide all the above mentioned services and activities at the various location required, how they would conduct a competition for a potential secon d source of computer hardware using a government coordinated performance specification during the first year of this effort, and how the Service Provider would meet the government’s need for a Total System Integrator.  Respones should be mailed to U.S. Arm y, CECOM Acquisition Center, AMSEL-ACCB-RT-K(MAT), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5008 or emailed to Alex.Matejka@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.

<DESC>This is the second request for information for AEROS.  The previous request was published in the Commerce Business Daily 20 December 2000.

 The Marine Corps has a Mission Need Statement for an AN/GVS-5 Laser Infrared Observation Set Replacement.  The Advanced Eye Safe Rangefinder System (AEROS) will be a small, lightweight, night observation capable system containing an integral, eye-safe laser rangefinder with azimuth and inclination capability.  AEROS will interface with the Precision Lightweight Global Positioning Receiver (PLGR) in order to provide accurate target location.  During tactical operations, including Operational Maneuver From the Sea, Marines must provide precision point fires and accurate volume fires, while maintaining mobility equal to that of the ground maneuver elements and minimizing logistical support requirements.  The AEROS will provide a simple, highly accurate target location device to the security and maneuver elements, down to the Fire Team level.  Currently, the Marine Corps? steadily growing precision munitions capability is not fully exploited, due to an extremely limited ability to execute ground precision targeting.  Absence of precision targeting will result in greater ammunition expenditures as well as increased collateral damage and injuries.    

Responses to this request for information should include a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) system that will provide:  

a.	Eye-safe laser rangefinder
b.	Night vision capability (add on or embedded)
c.	Man packed (light weight) - no greater than six (6) pounds 
d.	PLGR interface
e.   Azimuth determination capability (+/-10 mils) 
f.   Inclination determination capability (+/-5 mils)
g.  Range determination capability to at least 5 Km
h.  Digital Connectivity via an RS-232 interface
i.   Unpowered optical magnification and field of view characteristics similar to the M22 binocular   
j   Maintenance support package
k. The system must be functional in a Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) environment.  Personnel shall be capable of operating the AN/GVS-5 Replacement while wearing NBC protective clothing, Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) IV gear.

Industry firms capable of accomplishing the requirement, in whole or in part, are invited to submit a response.  Firms should identify/submit a copy of their GSA schedule, if available.  Firms should also include literature, brochures, and capability summaries that directly address their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.  If possible, firms should include information on cost and availability of small lot sizes via purchase order and/or leasing agreement as well as anticipated production lead times, schedules and monthly capacities.  In addition, any reliability and/or environmental test data as well as previous or existing government contracting experience on this specific type of equipment would be helpful in the evaluation.  Oral presentations to the Program Manager, Armor and Fire Support, will be held on 13-14 February 2002.  All firms are encouraged to participate in oral presentations, although it is not a requirement.  The presentation will include a COTS solution, a hardware demonstration and will not exceed two hours.  Interested firms are requested to respond NLT 8 February 2002, stating their business size, SIC Code, and identifying a corporate point of contact

<DESC>The Department of State (DOS) intends to negotiate on a sole basis with AOS, Inc. for airtime services for OC-128 System to bond two 64 Kbps INMARSAT M-4 Channels together and to optimize TCP/IP sessions over long delay links at 128 Kbps.  The Contractor shall provide 7 days a week and 24 hours a day support services for trouble shooting for technical difficulties.  The Contractor shall look at both the transmission and terminal as a single entity and be able to determine whether technical difficulties are due to the hardware/software issues or due to service provider issues.  For example, a user delays to the Middle East with OC-128 System where they find that their throughput is running at only 80 Kbps.  The problem could be either that the SNR is too low from the service provider resulting in an inordinate number of errors, or the problem might be that the OC-128 TCP/IP optimizer is not functioning. Firms that feel they can provide the formentioned services are invited to submit an affirmative response to comply with all the above requirements.  Response(s) must be received within 5 calendar days of this notice to the effect that comparable services are available and are more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through the proposed Contractor, or a sole-source award will be made.

On Tuesday, February 19, 2002, the United States General Services Administration (GSA), with conduct a Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session for prospective small business sub-contractors for the construction phase of the new United States District Courthouse in Miami, Florida.  The Networking Session will be from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.(local time) at the Sheraton Biscayne Bay Hotel, 495 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida.

The facility to be constructed will be occupied by the U.S. District Court, Office of the U.S. Attorney, the U.S. Marshals Service, and General Services Administration (GSA).  The magnitude of construction is $105,000,000 and $115,000,000.  All construction disciplines are expected to be represented on this project.

The Subcontracting Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA?s recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the firms which have been short-listed as the prospective prime contractor on this project.

Prospective small business subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with the short-listed contractors and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors.  Because GSA is not permitted to become involved in contractual relationships between prime and subcontractors, any contracts that may develop between potential primes and subcontractors as a result of this Networking Session will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Networking Session may be directed to either David Gibson, GSA?s Public Buildings Service Small Business Liaison for this project, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV; or Pat Geisinger, GSA?s Small Business Technical Advisor, Office of Enterprise Development, Telephone (404) 331-3031, E-Mail Pat.Geisinger@GSA.GOV.

Notice:  While we strongly encourage and desire attendance of all interested parties, space is not unlimited.  Attendees will be accommodated on a first come, first serve basis.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Thirteenth Common Test and Training Range Architecture (CTTRA) Workshop
<DESC>Thirteenth Common Test and Training Range Architecture (CTTRA) Workshop

	The Office of the Secretary of Defense has sponsored a series of workshops to support the development of selected Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) projects.  These CTTRA workshops were begun in April 1994 and have provided invaluable technical and programmatic direction to efforts to improve Department of Defense (DOD) test and training range capabilities by:  (1) promoting the interoperability, sharing, and reuse of resources essential to cost effectively create the distributed test environments needed to test today??s advanced weapons systems, and (2) improving the DOD test and training infrastructure to support the size, scale and scope of testing and training identified in the Joint Vision.

	Past CTTRA workshops focused on a common architecture for testing and training called the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), being developed by the Foundation Initiative 2010 (FI 2010) project.  At CTTRA XII the focus was expanded to include an enhanced tracking system for the test ranges, being developed by the Enhanced Range Applications Program (EnRAP) at Eglin AFB, Fl.  During CTTRA XIII EnRAP again will be presented and will center on finalizing the requirements for the capabilities to be developed by EnRAP.  The three main requirement topic areas for the EnRAP will be Data links, TSPI and Miniaturization.    

	The thirteenth CTTRA workshop will be help in New Orleans, LA, on February 27 ?C March 1, 2002.  Location will be the Renaissance Hotel, 817 Common Street, New Orleans, LA 70130.  Telephone is (504) 525-1111, (504) 525-0688 (Fax).

<SUBJECT>58 -- Laser Radar Workshop
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (formerly the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization) will be conducting a Laser Radar Workshop on February 26 ? 27, 2002, in Rosslyn, VA.  The purpose of this workshop is to familiarize the MDA with laser radar technology that may support missile defense missions.  This workshop will focus on laser radar technology for ballistic missile defense only; high-energy laser weapons, cruise missile defense, air defense, or ship defense will not be topics of this workshop.  Workshop participants will be invited to present 30-minute briefings on laser radar technology, which should include the following:  1.  For which MDA applications do you recommend your laser radar technologies? 2.  What is the current status of your laser radar technology for MDA applications? 3.  What is achievable during the next 10 years? 4. What are the most important technology issues of laser radar systems for missile defense applications?        5. How can the laser community help MDA resolve operational and technical issues?  In order to minimize the possibility of proprietary information being disclosed to competitors, the audience will consist of Government personnel and their designated systems engineering and technical assessment support contractors.  Conference presenters may only be present during their presentation.  Presentations at the conference will be by invitation only.  All parties interested in presenting their laser radar technology at this workshop must submit a one page summary discussing their laser radar technology, its applicability to ballistic missile defense, and their experience in laser radar technology development.   Summaries (electronic or written) must be received by Dr. Walt Dyer, (703) 697-3697, e-mail walter.dyer@bmdo.osd.mil, no later than 4:00 pm 01 February 2002.  MDA will select the workshop participants based upon the relevance of the laser radar technology to ballistic missile defense and demonstrated experience in laser radar technology development, as evidenced in their summary.  The workshop is for the purpose of information exchange only.
