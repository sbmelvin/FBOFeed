<CONTACT>Christopher Hasen
<DESC>In the following Sources Sought Synopsis, Electronic Systems Center, Operational Contracting (ESC/PKO) at Hanscom AFB, MA seeks potential sources for a government acquisition to perform the services of Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) analysis on semiconductor bulk crystals and film samples for compositional analysis. The anticipated NAICS code will be 541330 and small business size standard is $4.0 million. This is a Sources Sought Request Synopsis. There is no solicitation available at this time. Respond in accordance with information provided. The service to be provided is trace analysis characterization by secondary mass spectroscopy (SIMS) to be performed on specimens provided by the Government and provide reports of findings. Calibration standards currently required to perform the analysis are AlN, GaAs, GaN, GaSb, and ZnO. In the AlN calibration, the desired test for impurities includes the elements C, O, and Si. In the GaAS calibration, the desired test for impurities includes the elements C, Si, Fe, S, Ni, and Cr. In the GaN calibration, the desired test for impurities includes the elements H, C, O, Si, Mn, Mg, Zn, Ni, Cr, Cu, Co, K, Li, B, Na, Al, Ca, Mo, Cl, F, Fe, W, and Ti. In the GaSb calibration, the desired test for impurities includes the elements C, O, Zn, Be, Ge, Si, Se, Te, and Sn. In the ZnO calibration, the desired test for impurities includes the elements H, Li, Al, C, N, Si, P, Cu, Cl, Ga, As, Fe, Na, and K. Two configurations of specimens shall be investigated: Bulk crystal specimens 5 mm x 5 mm or greater, and layer analysis on 5mm x 5mm or greater surface. One report is required to be completed for each specimen analyzed. The report must give detection limits of elements for system used, quantification of elements, instrumental conditions, and results of trace analysis by elemental concentration in atoms/cm cubed vs depth in a graphical format. Each report is due within two weeks after each specimen is received. There will be approximately 30 specimens provided over a 1- year period by AFRL/SHNC to the contractor, 20 bulk specimens and 10 layer analysis specimens.
