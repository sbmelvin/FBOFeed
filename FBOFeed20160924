<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>* SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>* Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />* Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p><br />252.204-7004 Alternate A, System for Award Management (May 2013)</p>
<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active."</p>
<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>
<p>(1) "Defense items," defined in the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778(j)(4)(A), as defense articles, defense services, and related technical data, and further defined in the ITAR, 22 CFR Part 120.</p>
<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

b). The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (OCT 2014).

The proposal will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content.

Award will be made to Offeror whose price for items are lowest among all quotes that were deemed to be technically acceptable. Offerors who fail to meet the technical requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
1.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION APPROACH.

Descriptive literature (and supplemental technical proposals, if deemed necessary by offeror to supplement the descriptive literature) will be evaluated to determine whether the quoted items meet all of the technical requirements (described below) and are thus considered technically acceptable.  Any quoted product that does not meet all of the salient characteristics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and thus ineligible for award.   
2.   PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH.  Proposed pricing shall be provided on a unit price line basis in the Price and Schedule section. The Government will evaluate offers by adding the total of all line item prices.

Any proposed exceptions to solicitation terms and conditions
Offerors are hereby advised that any Offeror-imposed terms and conditions which deviate from the Government's material terms and conditions established, may render the Offeror's quote Unacceptable, and thus ineligible for award.
b). The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (OCT 2014). The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers based on (LPTA) Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable.
Quotes will be evaluated based on the following factors listed as shown below:
All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes.  The proposal will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content.  Proposals which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient.  Award will be made to Offeror whose price for items are lowest among all quotes that were deemed to be technically acceptable. Offerors who fail to meet the technical requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
1.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION APPROACH.  The evaluation process will consider whether the quote demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical features involved in meeting the requirements and whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined and satisfied the requirements.
Descriptive literature (and supplemental technical proposals, if deemed necessary by offeror to supplement the descriptive literature) will be evaluated to determine whether the quoted items meet all of the technical requirements (described below) and are thus considered technically acceptable.  Any quoted product that does not meet all of the salient characteristics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and thus ineligible for award.   
2.   PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH.  Proposed pricing shall be provided on a unit price line basis in the Price and Schedule section. The Government will evaluate offers by adding the total of all line item prices.  
Evaluation Process:  A Responsibility Determination will be made in accordance with FAR 9.1 Responsible Prospective Contractors.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.
Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840

A bid allowing less than the Government's minimum acceptance period will be rejected. The bidder agrees to execute all that it has undertaken to do, in compliance with its bid, if that bid is accepted in writing within 60 Calendar day acceptance period" <BR> <BR>

MCLEAN, VA 22102-3375
<DESC>The contractor will provide engineering, design and construction services as well as the requisite materials, equipment and permits to perform scopes of work listed under the RFP. The work includes design and construction of selected improvements at various Buildings in the Philadelphia Navy Yard which is located within the Philadelphia Naval Business Center in Philadelphia, PA.

Building Improvements:
Fans:
This project will install a total of 19 large (18-ft diameter or larger), heavy duty industrial High Volume, Low-Speed (HVLS) fans in the high bay areas of four industrial buildings (20, 546, 592, and 1029) at the Philadelphia Naval Yard (PNY). Building specific fan locations will be per the attachment in Part 6 of this RFP and will include the installation of 8 fans in building 20, 5 fans in building 1029, 3 fans in 546, 2 fans in the industrial area of 592, and 1 fan in the pattern shop on the mezzanine level of 592.
 The fan in the pattern shop is to be pre-fabricated with an LED light to improve lighting in this area. Each of the fans is to include a hermetically sealed, non-vented gear box (requiring no lubrication or maintenance). Also, they are to be designed for industrial heavy duty, long term use, equipped with the ability to respond to 365 day programmable controls and shall utilize 3-phase input system voltage. Additionally, all new mounting steel required to facilitate the installation of the fans shall be galvanized and bolted to the existing roof framing.

Fan Controls: (See D3060 for additional information)
The fans are to be designed to be controlled to conform to the building occupants working schedule as well as seasonal requirements.
 To facilitate this, all controls will need to be integrated with the existing DDC controllers located within the project buildings. These controls need to allow the fans to be powered on/off based on occupant schedules, provide the ability to adjust fan speed to conform to required temperature conditions given the seasonal requirement, and provide easy operator manipulation.

<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&amp;A)<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />FAR Part 6.3<br /><br />1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity: <br /><br />The Office of Acquisition Management is conducting this acquisition of other than full and open competition for software to provide security, technology, and personalization features on behalf of Passport Services Office.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.<br />This is a Directed Award to Graphic Security Systems (GSSC). This will be Firm-Fixed Price contract for Proprietary Software to provide security, technology and software features used in passport cards known as "personalization features".<br /><br />3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Department's needs.<br />This requirement is to provide the above mentioned software for the Passport Services office located in Washington, D.C. This will allow the Office of Passport Services to provide better security for United State Citizens.<br />GSSC's proprietary Personalization software has been customized to meet Department of State Passport Services laser engraving requirements and specifications. These include; GSSC's VIPhoto&reg; - Photo Enhancement software which ensures improved visual quality for proper encoding of overexposed and underexposed photos. Additionally, GSSC's automatic Background Extraction and Enhancement software improves encoding quality if the travel document design has a strong preprinted background overlapping with the photo area. To guarantee successful printing with quality micro-text readability and easy facial recognition of the micro-text ghost image, GSSC's DataScreen<sup>TM</sup> - Facial Feature Enhancer software aids to overcome the challenges of low printing resolution. The incorporation of this encoding process allows facial features to stand out in the steganographic ghost image overcoming all unfavorable effects.<br />Images encoded using GSSC's personalization software already contain a functionality called SI&reg; Digital Signature, which can be used to authenticate our VIPhoto&reg; and DataScreen<sup>TM</sup> images on a forensic scale, using our software application. All their images have a unique micro-text alignment which is determined both by the content of the personal data being embedded, and by the unique code assigned to the project. Authentication software scans the document, and generates a reference image with the expected micro-text alignment for given personal data. This enables the examiner to compare the scanned and reference micro-text, and determine if the image was created using GSSC software delivered for the project. <br />GSSC has developed SI&reg; Digital Decoder software, which can be used to digitally decode scans or photographs of the encoded images found on documents and/or ID cards. This software has been tested with leading passport reader brands, such as Cross Match, 3M, Rochford Thompson etc. Foster+ Freeman has licensed this technology from GSSC for use in their advanced forensic science instruments. Lastly, with the increasing popularity of smartphone use, GSSC has developed its own proprietary application that can be customized to decode multiple GSSC security features to accommodate the authentication and data analysis requirements of the U.S. State Department.<br />The digital decoding option makes the embedded security indicia image appear with a strong contrast and it can be stored for record keeping purposes. This unique combination of optical and digital decodability makes GSSC security indicia technology both an optical and a digital steganographic feature. <br /><br />4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 3304, as implemented by FAR 6.3 and substantiated by the following:<br />&#9746; FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br />5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the action require use of the authority cited.<br />Graphic Security Systems Corporation (GSSC) is uniquely qualified to provide these services to (Department of State's Passport Services Office because GSSC is a highly specialized U.S. company which has provided its steganographic technology to government agencies, security printing firms and major corporations for more than 35 years. Currently GSSC's IP portfolio includes over 3 granted U.S. patents and many additional patents worldwide in the steganographic area (see list below of U.S. patents pertaining to project). <br />U.S. encoding and digital decoding patents pertaining to project <br />U.S. Patent #8,682,025<br />U.S. Patent #7,512,249<br />U.S. Patent #7,561,308 <br />U.S. Patent #7,558,401 <br />U.S Patent #7,630,513 <br />U.S. Patent #8,019,115<br />These patents cover proprietary software methods for embedding, scrambling, hiding, encoding, decoding as well as optical and digital authentication devices. Today GSSC's steganographic images and software protect billions of printed documents and products each year. <br />6. A description of efforts to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies. <br />A notice will be publicized along with this justification for other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR parts 5 &amp; 6.<br />7. A determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>The Contracting Office determines that the anticipated price(s) will be fair and reasonable based on a quote received from GSSC dated April 9, 2015 which is priced in accordance with past acquisition history and a copy of GSSC invoice number 232117 dated June 9, 2016. By signing the justification the Contracting Officer makes a determination that the cost/price to the Government are expected to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>8. A description of the market survey conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted. <br />A market survey was not conducted. GSSC software is proprietary in nature and is uniquely suited to DOS's requirement, see paragraph 3 above.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of this justification.</p>
<p>The Department of State is anticipating a surge in passport requests due to international considerations and is concerned as well with any security issues that may arise. This supplier's software will allow for enhanced security measure to be put in place.</p>
<p><br />10. A listing of any sources that expressed a written interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>Not applicable</p>
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.</p>
<p>Specification for the Passport Cards and the Passport booklet may change in the future. At that time it is possible that some barriers to competition may be removed.</p>
