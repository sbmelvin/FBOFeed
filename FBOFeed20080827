<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for an Assessment of Uncertainty for Propellant TankExplosion Simulations in support of NASAs Simulation Assisted Risk Assessment (SARA)Project. SARA supports NASAs Ares Project through the use of physics-based analyses toassess failure environments associated with space exploration system failures. Thecurrent requirement involves high-fidelity simulation of various failure scenarios withpotential to lead to explosion in an effort to quantify the consequences of thesefailures. Ultimately, results of the simulations are expected to be processed in such away that consequences can be quantified and integrated with the SARA ascent abort riskmodeling effort. NASA/ARC intends to purchase this Assessment from Craft-Tech, the only company that hasthe required experience developing and analyzing failure environments for the SARAproject regarding potential consequences of leakage through a LH2/LOX tank commonbulkhead, bulkhead leak simulations, simulation of LOX/LH2 tank drop tests and simulationof boiling liquid, expanding vapor explosions (BLEVEs). Specific required capabilitiesinclude first-principles physics models for cryogenic fuel vaporization, turbulentmixing, and finite-rate combustion chemistry (hydrogen-oxygen), with subsequent blastwave initiation and propagation. In addition, the task requires demonstrated expertise inthe operation of the above-mentioned computational tools in the development of validresults. The current requirement is a continuation and expansion of previous workperformed by the vendor. This posting replaces previous posting NNA08258688Q-AMG. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon September 8, 2008.

The Final RFP for the follow-on to the current BASE contract has been released.  Thisextension is necessary to allow sufficient time for the receipt of proposals, evaluationof proposals, and award of the follow-on contract.  This extension will allow for acontinuation of current service orders issued, for modifications to existing serviceorders, and for new work until the BASE competitive follow-on contract is in place. Thecontract extension and increase to total CORE contract value and IDIQ maximum orderingvalue are necessary in order to ensure program continuity and critical mission supportand to avoid significant technical impacts to the BASE program.The current Contractor provides the following mission critical services to GSFCs ITCD:program management services; computer operations services; business infrastructuresupport services; application development, deployment, enhancement, and continuoussupport for business information systems; and sustaining engineering support. INDUS Corporation, as the current incumbent, has the combined training, experience, andexpertise to provide uninterrupted continuation of mission critical support.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the followingCommercial item: Quantity of 1 Integrated S-Band (2700-2900 Mhz) dual-polarized antennasystem.  The antenna system shall consist of a parabolic reflector, dual-polarized feedhorn, pedestal, drive motors, and servo-amplifiers.  The system shall be capable ofemitting and receiving both horizontal and vertical linearly polarized RF energy.  Theantenna system will be used as an integrated component of a transportable meteorologicalresearch radar, and all of the components, except the pedestal, shall be constructed sothat they may be shipped in standard ISO seatainers with outside dimensions of either2.44m x 2.44m x 6.1m (8' x 8' x 20') or 2.44m x 2.44m x 12.2m (8' x 8' 40').  The primaryobjective of the radar system is to collect meteorological research quality reflectivity,Doppler and polarimetric data at various locations in the world.  The antenna systemshall be capable of handling up to 1.0 megawatts peak pulsed power with pulse widths upto 2 microseconds and pulse recurrence frequencies up to 1200 pulses per second.  Theantenna will be scanned in the azimuth and elevation planes; it will not be used forclosed loop tracking.  The antenna-pedestal system will be designed to operate without aradome under wind, acceleration and environmental conditions as specified in theStatement of Work.  A high performance antenna is required for accurate measurements ofdual-polarimetric quantities.  The electrical specifications of th feed/OMT, reflectorsurface accuracy and secondary patterns are hence stringent as specified in the Statementof Work.  The Government will require a preliminary design review (PDR), a final designreview (FDR), and range testing at which time the contractor will certify that allspecifications have been met.

Period of performance:  September 29, 2008 through September 30, 2008.

The Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) is a national health communication survey conducted biennially by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which has the vital mission of developing and implementing programs that prevent and reduce the incidence of cancer. The task of planning, developing, and coordinating research on health communication relevant to cancer control falls within the realm of the Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB), in the Behavioral Research Program (BRP) in the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) at the NCI. HINTS was designed to support the mission of the Branch and the Institute by providing a means to systematically evaluate the public’s cancer-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors relevant to health communication, which have not adequately been studied through other national data collection efforts prior to HINTS.

In an effort to increase population reach, NCI has partnered with the University of Puerto Rico to use the existing Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Infrastructure to administer the HINTS 2007 survey in Puerto Rico.  The University of Puerto Rico shall provide services to the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Behavioral Research Program, Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch in planning, conducting, and analyzing Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 2007) administration among a sample of the population of Puerto Rico. Health Partners Research Foundation shall provide support and scientific expertise to the National Cancer Institute and its appointed delegates.

Health Partners Research Foundation is uniquely positioned to carry out the tasks described herein. Health Partners Research Foundation is part of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Research Network; the research conducted by CRN at Health Partners Research Foundation focuses on the characteristics of patients, clinicians, communities, and health systems that influence cancer outcomes. This program of research, based on the use of the health care system as a venue for clinical, basic, and population health research, is aligned with the strategic vision of the National Cancer Institute.  Health Partners Research Foundation has a demonstrated history of partnership with the National Cancer Institute and employs investigators who are familiar with the key initiatives and priorities of the National Cancer Institute, in general, and the Health Communication Informatics Research Branch and the Health Information National Trends Survey program of research, in particular. Dr. Rutten of Health Partners is the proposed lead on this project for Health Partners.  Dr. Rutten has vast experience with the HINTS program, serving as a member of the HINTS management team, assisting in the development of dissemination tools and activities, establishing and maintaining liaison with external HINTS contractors, and publishing several analyses. Health Partners Research Foundation is the only source known to the NCI with the expertise to perform the tasks outlined in the procurement.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on September 11, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.

<DESC>ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFCATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  THERE IS NO RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.


This is the second of a series of contracts that NAVFAC Pacific intends to issue for various projects covered by the Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI) and other projects under the cognizance of NAVFAC Pacific (see the final paragraph of this notice for additional information on prior/future synopses).  NAVFAC Pacific is the Department of Defense's Executive Agent for Construction on Guam and is the designated design and construction agent for the DPRI associated with the rebasing of approximately 8,000 Marines and their dependents from Okinawa to Guam.


Engineering and Design Services are required for a Design Support Contract for Various Waterfront/Marine Related Projects Covered by the DPRI and Other Projects under the Cognizance of NAVFAC Pacific.  Area of contract coverage is primarily in Guam, U.S.A., but may include work in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI) or in locations anywhere in the Pacific and Indian Oceans under NAVFAC Pacific's areas of responsibility.  Planned projects include primarily Military Construction (MCON) or Government of Japan funded military construction projects involving new construction and repair and alteration of waterfront/marine facilities (including piers and wharves, dredging, building structures, and utilities systems to support waterfront/marine operations or activities). 


Design support services include, but are not limited to, the preparation of project engineering documentation, DD 1391s, preliminary and final plans and specifications including preparation of Design-Build Request for Proposal (RFPs) contract documents or Design Bid Build contract documents, technical reports including engineering investigations and concept studies, preparation of facilities and land use planning studies, construction cost estimates, operations and maintenance manuals, record drawings, shop drawing reviews, redi-check reviews and construction consultation and geotechnical investigations as required for design, analysis and studies.   Other support services may include post-construction award services; construction surveillance and inspection services; operational and maintenance support information services; and other miscellaneous post-construction award services.


All work shall be performed in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local policy, guidance, regulations, and laws including, but not limited to the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) Design Procedures, MIL-HDBK-1190 Facility Planning and Design Guide, and UFC 4-010-01 DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), Panama City, FL intends to award a sole-source firm-fixed purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Innovative Professional Solutions Inc (IPS) of Panama Beach City, FL for a preproduction circuit assembly test unit, six production Programmer MK 11, and spare parts for the six units.  This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.   IPS has been providing key engineering and technical support to the Mod 3 program, including Programmer Mk 11 development efforts for the past 6 years.  The company and its personnel have critical technical knowledge pertaining to the Programmer Mk 11 and TDD Mk 71 not available elsewhere.  This technical knowledge is required for the unique requirements for configuring and assembling of the small quantity of Programmers Mk 11 required to complete Fleet outfitting. It is estimated that obtaining any other source for this effort would increase its cost and delivery time by as much as 100% and greatly increase technical, cost and schedule risk to the program. Delivery will be required by 31 December 2008 FOB to NSWC PCD, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City FL 32407. NAICS 335999 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 employees. PSC R425

<DESC>The objective of the Education Administration Program in Georgia is to address chronic education needs in Georgia, USAID/Caucasus proposes a new 3-year Education Management Project with the expected result of building management capacity in the education sector through establishment of an education management training program for administrators supported by necessary financial and administrative policy reforms.  The approximate amount of the award will be between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 and program implementation is estimated to begin in January 2009.  

The Education Management Project will have two objectives:

1. Improve the long-term institutional capacity of Georgia to better manage the education system and lead its transformation;  and,

2. Ensure the effectiveness of education policies on management, finance, and accreditation through support to the Ministry of Education and Science, MES educational agencies, and ERCs.

Successful completion of the program scope of work components will result in the establishment of a strong Master’s of Education Administration degree program as well as short-term training programs at Ilia Chachavadze University.  Graduates from these programs will have the necessary management skills needed to improve administration and educational quality in their institutions.  National policies on school management and decentralization will be refined to allow for more effective regional planning and decision-making and greater resource availability for schools.  The Ministry of Education will be able to base its decisions on more reliable national, regional, and school level data as well as through participatory discussions with the civil society organizations and local communities.  University education quality will be improved through the adoption of internationally recognized standards in the accreditation of university programs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This contract is primarily intended to carry out the design requirements of the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) construction program using Building Information Modeling (BIM).  BIM utilizes computer-aided design (CAD) technology with 'intelligent' information loaded three dimensional models.  BIM will assist the 'Designer of Record' in producing complete sets of plans, design analyses, specifications and cost estimates for USAR facilities.  The benefits of BIM technology include: (1) 3-D visualization of design concepts; (2) improved coordination between design disciplines; (3) automated cost estimating/material takeoffs; (4) automated CADD standardization and code compliance; and (5) enhanced facility management capability.  The required project task orders under this IDIQ contract may include some or all of the following types of building structures: Training Centers (which include: administration, education, assembly, storage, special training and other support spaces); Vehicle Maintenance Shops (which include: work bays, administration, special training, storage & support spaces); Stand-Alone Buildings (which include: unheated storage & Direct Support/General Support warehouses); and other Army Reserve and military facilities. Associated design effort may include: civil site design; demolition and/or the renovation of existing facilities; environmental compliance; NEPA documentation associated with a design project; controlled waste and flammable storage; asbestos, lead and PCB surveys and/or abatement & utility investigations. Other functions beyond traditional design may include: the development of simplified design approaches, using Army Reserve Design Criteria to carry out designs for the USAR Full Facility Restoration Program; updating the Army Reserve Design Criteria (this may be a part of project specific requirement or as requested by the Army Reserve to create or update the specific specifications, and/or graphic data); performance of engineering feasibility studies, site assessments, and DD Form 1391 development related to new USAR projects and project sites; providing construction management services (shop drawing review, site inspection, etc. for Army Reserve construction projects). Construction cost estimating will be accomplished using the Micro-Computer Aided Cost Estimating System 2nd Generation (MII) software (software and database is available from the Government for a nominal fee). Specifications must be electronically developed using Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS), Louisville District Guide Specifications, modified Corps of Engineers Guide Specifications created for the Army Reserve, and Industry Standard Specifications. All specifications shall be edited using SpecsIntact Automated Specification processing system. All project specifications shall be written in the Specs Intact Format. Electronic drawings will be required for all activities. Electronic drawing development will be accomplished using MicroStation Version 8.5 or greater, and using the MicroStation TriForma suite of modeling tools. For specific projects, the awarded firm may be required to provide resumes or completed SF330 forms for a certified industrial hygienist, a military master planner, and/or a laboratory accredited in Bulk Asbestos Fiber Analysis given by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), as part of the design team.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The Uniformed
Services University
of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda,
 Maryland, intends to negotiate a
contract, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1 (b),
with GE (General Electric) Healthcare to supply a GE Logiq e Ultrasound Machine
with linear and curved probes, docking cart, travel case, full software
package, and support manuals/service agreement. The GE Logiq e Ultrasound Machine
and its accessories are being procured as a commercial item in accordance with
the procedures in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13
(Simplified Acquisition Procedures). The sole source determination is based on GE
Healthcare being the only vendor to supply a small, portable ultrasound machine
with the highest resolution of body tissues due to GE Healthcare&rsquo;s proprietary
software, CrossBeam. Extremely high tissue resolution is needed to ensure that surgical
needles are visualized well and directed into the exact desired tissue
structure that needs therapy. Additionally, the ultrasound machine must be
relatively small and portable for use in the many clinics where USUHS sports
medicine physicians provide consultation and ultrasound-guided needle
procedures.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">This is not a request for quote. However,
all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below.
Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide
compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned system as
specified. Additionally, a determination by the government not to compete this
proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the
discretion of the government. Responses must be submitted electronically, via

<DESC>Project Reroof Connecting Corridors Project #692-07-106. The RFP will be issued on a Veteran Owned Small Business set aside basis for construction of new roof.  The location is White City, Oregon. : General Construction: Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, material, and equipment to provide removal of existing roofing and replacement of roofing on connecting corridors as shown on the drawings and described by the specifications. This includes, but is not limited to, removal of existing roof, repair roof decking and reinstall single ply membrane roofing per specifications.  The magnitude of construction is between $100,000 and $500,000. The RFP solicitation is anticipated to be issued on or about September 2, 2008, and offers will be due on or about September 17, 2008. No public bid opening procedures are applicable to this solicitation. A firm fixed price contract is anticipated to be awarded using Best Value evaluation criteria. Anticipated award date is September 22, 2008. The performance period is expected to be 45 calendar days. North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 238160.  The Small Business Size Standard is $14 Million. After solicitation issuance, contractors may view and/or download this solicitation and all amendments at the FedBizOps website. The Primary Point of Contract for this project is Ms. Patricia Kelley, Contract Specialist, patricia.kelley4.@va.gov.  Telephone questions will not be answered. The Government reserves the right to use only the Internet as notification of any amendments to this solicitation. It is the offerors responsibility to view the FedBizOps website daily for amendments to the solicitation. This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures. The Government intends to use the trade-off process in selecting the prime contractor. The trade-off process is a method of evaluating both the technical factors specified in the solicitation and the price.  The object is to select the proposal that offers best value. The RFP will consist of two packages to be submitted at the same time; a technical proposal and a price proposal. The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm (2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel. Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality. Price proposal packages of offerors will then be evaluated. Price and technical are equal in importance.  The Government may proceed with the award of the contract without discussion. However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award and may discuss proposals with the offerors. If discussions are necessary, the Government will establish a competitive range.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation, and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price that is the most advantageous to the Government.

<p>This is a sources-sought notice to determine contractors who would be interested in this competitive procurement. The anticipated contract will be one base year, plus five option years. The contractor must possess a TOP SECRET facility clearance to secure certain classified solicitation documentation located in the bidder's library. All Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) positions will require a minimum of SECRET clearance, with several positions requiring TOP SECRET/SCI clearances. Due to the classification of the information handled by most O&amp;M personnel, foreign entities will not be considered. The Statement of Work is unclassified. The O&amp;M of two current online Mobile Sensors (MS) platforms, plus another new MS platform due online early FY2013, is being opened for competitive source selection. The COBRA JUDY instrumentation system is installed on the United States Naval Ship (USNS) Observation Island, COBRA JUDY is capable of gathering extensive radar data on orbiting earth satellites and ballistic missiles. COBRA JUDY consists of two radar systems, along with numerous support systems. The support systems consist of automatic data processing equipment (ADPE), extensive communications suites, navigation, timing, and weather. The S-Band coherent monopulse radar system is a phased-array consisting of a 250-ton rotating turret, housing the sixteen Traveling Wave Tubes (TWTs), supporting power supplies and modulators, and the antenna array. The supporting S-Band electronics and ADPE are located off-turret. The X-Band coherent monopulse radar system consists of a 30-foot dish antenna steerable in azimuth and elevation, with two TWTs installed on-mount. The X-Band HV power supplies, modulators and electronics are installed off-mount. The GRAY STAR instrumentation system is installed on the USNS Invincible. GRAY STAR is capable of collecting radar data on orbiting earth satellites and tactical ballistic missiles. GRAY STAR consists of two radar systems, along with numerous support systems. The support systems consist of ADPE, communications suite, navigation and timing. Both the S and X-Band radar systems use a common 5-meter dish antenna. The S and X-Band TWT transmitters are located within a newly-constructed permanent ship enclosure. The supporting electronics and ADPE are located within the Radar Instrumentation Center. The third system, COBRA JUDY Replacement (CJR), is currently being manufactured and will be integrated onboard an unnamed USNS ship, currently being constructed. The system will consist of both a Phased Array S-Band radar system and a Phased Array X-Band radar system. Both systems will employ T/R modules, versus TWT applications. The electronics, timing, navigation and diagnostic programs for both radar systems are all located in the Common Back End. Approximately one year prior to CJR IOC (Oct 2011) the CJR Program Office will fund the O&amp;M contractor to support IOT&amp;E testing of the CJR radar and instrumentation systems. This will consist of full technical and logistical manning. Upon achieving IOC, the CJR platform will be fully integrated into the O&amp;M contract. The offerer will have responsibility for all aspects of O&amp;M, to include, but not limited to, radar operations, organizational and depot-level maintenance aboard all platforms, configuration control, software maintenance and modification, COMSEC management, extensive Navy-oriented communications suites, instrumentation availability for extended periods, supply and specialized maintenance support to include full integrated logistics support, engineering support to all platforms, and data reduction and analysis responsibilities.</p>
<p>All three mobile instrumentation platforms are unique one-of-a-kind systems with extremely critical performance characteristics and mission availability requirements. This performance-based solicitation requires the contractor to meet established data collection criteria, requiring high levels of system reliability during mission periods. The offerer must have sufficient experience with radar and ancillary equipment and personnel skilled in operating and maintaining these type systems. Communications personnel must have in-depth knowledge of DOD, COMSEC and US Navy communications procedures and must be qualified to hold TS/SCI security clearances. Offerer must have sufficient depth of depot-level maintenance personnel to deploy worldwide to effect repairs and perform depot-level maintenance on all instrumentation systems as directed by CDRL and MS Operating Instructions. Offerer must have sufficient depth of both RF and software engineers to effect repairs onboard all platforms that are beyond capability of onboard technical staff. There is no level of effort requirement in this solicitation but the Government reserves the right to activate this requirement via specific CLIN if necessary. In addition, the Government has reserved certain CLINs for possible future additional radar logistics support. For this source selection, utilization of currently employed operation and maintenance personnel for ship borne systems is considered by the Air Force a major risk abatement technique. Willingness to employ this technique must be presented as part of your response to the solicitation that will be issued at a later date. Please fax to the above referenced contracting officer the following information: a) Point of Contact who possesses minimum SECRET clearance, with email address, voice and fax telephone numbers; b) name, email address and phone number of company security manager; c) point of contact and phone number of Defense Security Service office that surveils your company. Statement of Work (DRAFT) attached</p>

<DESC><p>Request for Information / Sources Sought (RFI)
<p>Reverse Engineering of three components of the Data Transfer Equipment (DTE)</p>
<p><br />1.0 SUBJECT</p>
<p>This RFI / Sources Sought request is for the reverse engineering of the Data Transfer Equipment (DTE) for the F-16 Aircraft. Responses are due for this RFI no later than 30 days after posting.</p>
<p>2.0 DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal or an invitation for bid and is not to be construed as a commitment to award one or more resulting contracts.</p>
<p>The government (416 SCMS/GUMAC) wants to find a source to provide a technical data package down to the piece part level (i.e. level III like drawings) and repair/overhaul capability on the DTE. The technical data and repair/overhaul procedures will have to be reversed engineered by the contractor. The government will provide ample assets for the contractor to reverse engineer the DTE. The government intends to have the technical data package and repair/overhaul procedures delivered. As a possible option, the government will have the contractor provide the government "turn-key" repair/overhaul capability. The contractor will not have any proprietary data rights.</p>
<p>Specifically, this RFI seeks the technical data package and repair/overhaul procedures for government use on the following items:</p>
<p>&bull; 72/80 MB Data Transfer Cartridge (DTC)<br />NSN: 7045-01-406-3579WF, PN: 3962000000-12, P/N 3961000001-12<br />&bull; Upgraded Data Transfer Unit ( UDTU )<br />NSN: 7025-01-065-5838WF PN: 35Y000001, P/N35Y10000000<br />&bull; Micro-CID<br />NSN: 7025-01-487-3793WF PN: 17X1000000-01</p>
<p>3.0 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DATA TRANSFER EQUIPMENT</p>
<p>The UDTU is a major part of the DTE and operates as a Receiver Transmitter (RT) attached to a multiplex data bus. The UDTU operates in the command/response mode and supports a controlled exchange of information between itself and the avionics system as follows: <br />a. Avionics information required for a mission is programmed using the Micro-CID onto the 72/80 MB DTC which is then inserted into the UDTU and used for avionics system setup.<br />b. Information is exchanged via the multiplex data bus between the UDTU and a RT or bus controller<br />c. The data in the DTC is then used for post flight analysis.</p>
<p><br />4.0 SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE</p>
<p>Following is a suggested outline for a response to this RFI. This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government. Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit.<br />1. Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.<br />2. Please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach and any relevant lessons learned.</p>
<p>5.0 DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. A response to this notice is not an offer and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>6.0 CONTACT INFORMATION</p>
<p>Following is the Point of Contact (POC) for this RFI:</p>
<p>Diann Larsen (Contracting Officer)<br />448 SCMG/PKAB<br />6050 Gum Lane<br />Hill AFB, UT 84056-5820<br />Diann.Larsen@HILL.af.mil<br />(801) 777-9349</p>

<DESC><p>The 6th Contracting Squadron at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB), FL is seeking responses from interested lodging establishments to provide off-base lodging to visiting personnel. This is a Request for Information (RFI) ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.<br /><br />The purpose of this market research (sources sought synopsis) is to determine the availability of off-base lodging within a 15-mile radius of MacDill AFB. The 6th Contracting Squadron is considering Blanket Purchase Agreements on a Firm-Fixed price basis with 5 separate lodging establishments. It is estimated that 560 rooms total (420 single occupancy and 140 double occupancy) will be needed on a monthly basis but not necessarily all at one time.&nbsp; For simplification purposes, we are requiring each establishment to have the ability to provide 112 rooms (560/5 = 112; 84 single occupancy and 28 double occupancy) or more at one time. Establishments are also subject to various inspections to include fire safety (NFPA Life Safety Code 101), public health and meet safety standards as outlined in AFOSH 91-001, <em>Billeting Operations</em>. It is important to note that prospective vendors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration database prior to the award of a contract with the Federal Government. Please see http://www.ccr.gov/Default.aspx for additional details.</p>
<p>Firms responding to this RFI are asked to provide the following information in their initial response: company's full name, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">business size</span>, DUNS/CAGE Codes, GSA # (if applicable), address, point of contact, and a clear indication as to whether or not they can provide the item the government is seeking. In addition, please indicate if your lodging facility is already in compliance with the inspections mentioned above. The 6th Contracting Squadron is only seeking responses from actual lodging establishments and not booking agencies or a "middle man." Final responses to this RFI will be due on 03 Sep 2008, 4:00 pm EST. Responses will be reviewed and may result in further clarifications to further explore commercial capabilities with selected respondents. As industry may expect to see portions of submitted information in future solicitations, portions of the response containing proprietary information should be clearly marked as such. Information submitted will not be returned to the respective respondents. Oral submissions of information are not acceptable and will not be accepted in response to this notice. The POC for this synopsis is 2Lt Matthew Comer, Contract Specialist, Phone: (813) 828-7481; Fax (813) 828-3667, Email: matthew.comer@macdill.af.mil. Please use this contact information for any questions.</p>

<DESC>D – Request for Information for Protection of DoD Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)

Classification Code:  Systems integration design services
                                  Network systems integration design services

NAICS Code:  541512

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Closing Date:  September 10, 2008

The Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) in partnership with the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT)) is conducting market research to identify industry capabilities involving the acquisition, processing, transfer, and storage of controlled unclassified information (CUI).  CUI, as defined in Presidential Memorandum entitled “Designation and Sharing of Controlled Unclassified Information,” dated May 9, 2008, is information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 12958, as amended, but is pertinent to the national interests of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the U.S. Federal Government, and under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure, special handling safeguards, or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.  This memorandum applies to CUI provided by either party for use under or produced under a DoD contract, cooperative agreement, grant, other transaction, or any other legal relationship.  For DoD contracts and programs, this includes information such as:

•	Technical data in accordance with DoDD 5230.24, Distribution Statements on Technical Documents and DoDD 5230.25, Withholding of Unclassified Technical Data from Public Disclosure.
•	Data subject to export control under International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).
•	Data subject to export control under the Commerce Control List (CCL) for dual-use technology (e.g., Militarily Critical Technologies). 
•	Data designated as Critical Program Information (CPI) in accordance with DoD Directive 5200.39, Security, Intelligence, and Counterintelligence Support to Acquisition Program Protection.

Reference AR 25-2, the term “information system” means set of information resources organized for the collection, storage, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, disposition, display, or transmission of information.  Includes Automated Information Systems (AIS) applications, enclaves, and outsourced Information Technology (IT) based processes, and platform IT interconnections.

The Government is seeking information on how industry partners maintain Information Assurance (IA) programs to provide sufficient safeguards to ensure that all CUI (including all sensitive data, whether digital or non-digital) in the possession of the Contractor is identified, marked, and protected from unauthorized access and release.  This includes, but is not limited to, how industry partners protect CUI that is transported or displayed on any information system that they own, operate, control, or utilize.  Additionally, how do industry partners handle CUI data at rest using NIST FIPS 140-2, certified crypto module.  This includes data stored on corporate servers, mobile devices, and portable storage media.  The Government is also interested in industry’s standard procedures for handling, assessing whether there has been a breach, assess what has been compromised, fixing the problem, and preventing the compromise, exfiltration, or other loss of CUI in the future.  

PEO EIS is planning to include requirements for the protection of CUI in future acquisitions and is seeking information from industry partners regarding programs and processes used to mitigate compromise of CUI on Defense Industrial Base (DIB) unclassified networks in order to include language in future acquisitions to ensure measures are in place for the protection of CUI on DIB networks.   PEO EIS is seeking to establish requirements for the protection of CUI and would like to include established industry best practices that exceed areas such as ISO and NIST standards and Information Assurance, where possible.  

Interested sources will provide a white paper describing Information Systems Security Plans, Information Assurance Program Plans, or similar plans, that are currently in place to protect controlled unclassified information (CUI) and the type of contract language industry recommends for future RFPs to ensure sharing of responsibility and interaction with the Government to protect CUI.  The white paper should also include a description of non-technical policies and practices that are used to protect against unauthorized disclosure and data extraction of CUI.  

RFI Purpose and Limitations:

The Government understands that malicious parties exist and try to obtain information on DoD/Army programs, and their efforts extend to attempts to obtain information from our industry partners’ information systems.  The Government’s intention is to better understand the current, state-of-the-art capabilities and strategies to determine the best solution.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.  This RFI is an expression of the Government’s interest only and does not obligate the Government to pay for the requested information nor respond to any submissions.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be properly marked.

Please limit your formal white paper submission to no more than ten (10) pages, not including the cover letter or any attachments.  In addition, you may include up to five attachments that consist of briefing slides, suggested contract language, current plans, or standard operating procedures.  Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged.  All items must be compatible with Microsoft Office 2000 or Adobe PDF format and free of all computer viruses.

Technical questions and industry responses shall be submitted via email to GSA FEDSIM Contracting Officer, Barbara C. Johnson:  barbara.c.johnson@gsa.gov.  Additionally, please provide electronic copies to:  Dr. Mark Thomas, mark.thomas2@us.army.mil


Responses must be received no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, on September 10, 2008.

All material submitted in response to this RFI must be unclassified and properly marked.

Points of Contact:

Contractual:  Barbara C. Johnson, Contracting Officer (barbara.c.johnson@gsa.gov), 703-589-2659.

Technical:  Dr. Mark A. Thomas (mark.thomas2@us.army.mil)

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY

This RFI is issued as Market Research, solely for information and planning purposes. It shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Any response to this synopsis will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this synopsis or the Government for use of such information.  The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and in its Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives and Performance Specifications.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued. If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of any potential offeror to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

Information received in response to this RFI may be used to determine the acquisition strategy for any resultant RFP.  Therefore, any small business concern with the capability to perform the required services is encouraged to submit a response to the RFI. 

The release of this RFI affords industry the opportunity to comment on any perceived issues with regard to the initiative and to allow the Government to receive the benefit of industry comments.  The Government’s purpose in providing an opportunity for industry comment is to identify potential problem areas and provide alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of the initiative.  The Government believes industry feedback is important.  The Government is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative.  What new capabilities within the past five years have provided the biggest ROI, are industry standards, and describe what you see as the industry trend over the next five years.  What has been your experience in performance-based delivery methods and techniques?  Describe your experience with performance-based and/or incentives-based contracts.

SERVICE LEVEL/PERFORMANCE METRICS.  The Government is interested in Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Performance Metrics used by industry to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of hardware and software maintenance support.  The Government is interested in operational metrics (those used to monitor day-to-day activities) and management metrics (those used by management to gauge key indicators of success, executive dashboard, etc.).  Additionally, the Government is interested in how industry balances using leading (forecasting) and lagging (static) metrics.  Since the Government is exploring the use of a performance-based contracting approach, it would be helpful to understand the service levels/performance metrics used to manage the operations, and those metrics used as a basis for payment.

<DESC><p>The US Department of Commerce (DOC)/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Weather Service (NWS)/Acquisition Management Division are seeking information on potential operations and maintenance support for the Historical Climatology Network-Modernized (HCN-M).
<p>NOAA is modernizing 1,000 stations in the Historical Climatology Network (HCN), a regional system of ground-based observing sites that collect climate, weather and water measurements. NOAA's goal is to have HCN work in tandem with the Climate Reference Network (CRN) to feed consistently accurate, high-quality data to scientists studying climate trends. The modernization of the HCN will enhance the extent of America's premiere data source for tracking regional climate variations and trends.</p>
<p>The Government seeks a comprehensive operations and maintenance solution to include logistic support, field maintenance, change tracking, metadata reporting, and operational monitoring that has been demonstrated to substantially meet the following performance requirements:<br />&bull; HCN-M sites shall receive a minimum of one visit to each station every year, with no more than 12 months between visits. <br />&bull; All HCN-M instruments shall be calibrated before field issuance and have their calibration verified not less frequently than annually to a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable reference technique or method. <br />&bull; HCN-M sites shall be capable of operation in an unattended mode (i.e., no human presence). <br />&bull; The HCN-M shall provide for metadata, at a minimum, consistent with National Weather Service Instruction (NWSI) 10-1312.<br />&bull; The HCN-M shall provide a facility to document changes to the station environment, equipment, procedures, personnel, communications, and other operating parameters as metadata and provide to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).<br />&bull; The HCN-M system shall adhere to guidance associated with contributing observing systems as provided in the GEOSS 10-Year Implementation Plan and the U.S. Integrated Earth Observation System (IEOS) Strategic Plan.<br />&bull; The HCN-M shall adhere to the National Academy of Science (NAS)-National Research Council (NRC)/NOAA/World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-accepted Ten Principles of Climate Monitoring (National Academy of Sciences, 1997)<br />&bull; HCN-M data processing shall incorporate automated quality control (QC) processes to detect malfunctioning sensors and support equipment, engineering information approaching predetermined thresholds, and suspect observational values. <br />&bull; HCN-M metadata processing shall include automated and manual QC processes to detect erroneous, incomplete, and suspect entries.<br />&bull; HCN-M data processing shall make available all HCN-M field site observational data, assigned QC flags, all metadata, and site station history within one hour of receipt. <br />&bull; HCN-M data and metadata processing shall be able to accept physical delivery (such as upload from a flash memory drive) of the data and metadata in the scenario that the data cannot be electronically transmitted over the telecommunications infrastructure. (Note: all information about maintenance practices and maintenance visits, all system changes, are considered to be metadata)<br />&bull; HCN-M documentation and other metadata shall be evaluated to identify information subject to privacy protections. Access to such privacy-protected information shall be restricted based upon applicable Federal and NOAA guidelines.<br />&bull; HCN-M shall maintain a formal change control process in compliance with NWSI 10-101 to manage and document HCN-M data new and existing data holdings (data, information, and metadata) as well as HCN-M system components.<br />&bull; The HCN-M Change Control Board (CCB) will have delegated members to evaluate program issues and vote on changes. <br />&bull; Each HCN-M site shall collect data from all sensors not less than 99 percent of the time on an annual basis.<br />&bull; The HCN-M system shall have an annual data completeness of 98 percent of all possible observations. <br />&bull; Each HCN-M installation shall allow for parallel observations between the modernized site and the existing climate station(s) for two years following initial service from the automated site.<br />&bull; NWS shall commission all HCN-M Sites in accordance with NWSI 80-2. NCDC will have responsibility for commissioning the data.<br />&bull; The HCN-M project shall comply with the requirements of NOAA Administrative Order 212-15, "Management of Environmental and Geospatial Data and Information."</p>
<p>The modernization of the HCN is following a "climate-region" approach, starting with a pilot project in the Southwest Climate Region (CO, AZ, UT, NM), where 140 sites are being modernized. HCN-M sites will be equipped with sensors and supporting equipment to collect and transmit three independent measurements of temperature and three independent measurements of liquid precipitation. HCN-M sites will comply with the following specifications:</p>
<p>&bull; All instrumentation at each HCN-M site shall adhere to standards for accuracy consistent with NOAA and WMO standards for climate data as defined in the table below:</p>

<DESC>Naval Inventory Control Point - Mechanicsburg, is conducting a Request for Information (RFI) / Sources Sought for existing Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) ruggedized computer transportation cases. The Government does not intend to engage industry to make cases specific to this requirement. This information is being requested for the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Program Management Activity (PMA).
CURRENT STATEArmed Forces technical personnel use Portable Electronic Maintenance Aids (PEMA) laptop computers used onboard ship and in operational theaters to access flight data information resident on aircraft, store technical manuals as well as maintenance and safety bulletins. As part of the Automated Maintenance Environment, a laptop was required that would perform in a hostile environment. It had to be ruggedized to withstand, rough treatment, shocks, vibration, be viewable in sunshine, sealed from environment (no fans to introduce dust and sand into the interior), etc.; in short, the unit needed to be operational and reliable regardless of climate or conditions. Currently fielded PEMAs are Panasonic CF-18 / 19 and CF-29 / 30. This RFI is to hold the PEMAs currently in inventory.
PEMA systems are deployed with military units to theaters of operation; shipment of these units can be by ship or aircraft; aircraft may include C-17 and C-130. Currently, there is no standardized shipping container - units and commands transport systems in any case they have available.
The requirements of this RFI detail a multipurpose case solution: one that enables the safe and manageable transportation of a five PEMA wireless system to a forward deployed operational site or ship. Once arriving, field personnel remove front and rear lids, make an electrical and network connection; the soulution should be operational at this point. To successfully deploy and protect PEMA systems, transportation cases are required that can withstand shipment and operation in the same environment required for the PEMA systems.
NAVICP will utilize an on line communication and collaboration tool called Procuri to post this Request for Information, attachments and other pertinent information. All communications between the Contracting Officer and the vendor, as well as uploading of technical information will occur through this tool. Parties interested in this requirement shall contact Chris Seier, Chris.Seier@navy.mil, Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer will initiate vendor registration in the system to allow access and participation; vendors will receive then receive an email with further information. Phone calls and emails will ONLY be accepted if related to registration and technical problems with the Procuri system.

<a href="mailto:sebrena.lane@amedd.army.mil">Southeast Regional Contracting Office</a>
<DESC>65 Medical Supplies Potential Sources Sought. A.General Information.The Southeast Region TRBO Reg.3 and 4, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities, MTF, in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation, RFRIAQ, for the standardization of SPECIMEN TRANSPORT BAGS. The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or sources at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center, FT Gordon, GA; Winn Army Community Hospital, FT Stewart, GA; Martin Army Community Hospital, FT Benning, GA; Naval Hospital Jacksonville, NAS Jacksonville, FL, 96th Medical Group, Eglin AFB, FL; Naval Hospital Pensacola, Pensacola, FL; Naval Hospital Beaufort, Beaufort, SC, 81st Medical Group, Kessler AFB, MS and the 6th Medical Group, Mac Dill AFB, FL. This standardization action is part of the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, DSCP, and Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement,DAPA,and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements, RIAs that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site as indicated at Government Agency URL.The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement, RIA will be for a base period of two years, 24 months from date of selection with three 12 month option periods not to exceed 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is November 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. Clinical performance and technical company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. The Technical Company and Clinical Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. Point of Contact: Ginny Slayton,706-787-2019, Government agency URL provided. B. Products and Performance Required. The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of SPECIMEN TRANSPORT BAGS, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12 month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical Company Criteria below. At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide onsite support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor. C. Instructions to Vendors. DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical company criteria and 1. Company name and address, 2. Company POC Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address as indicated below. Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date time of this sources sought notice. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process. This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc.,vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing per the FBO RFQ will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer. D. Evaluation Criteria. The TriService Product Review Board, TPRB is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80 percent of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. Phase ITechnical Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet provide responses to the technical company criteria stated below. All technical company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the TriService Product Review Board, TPRB, and determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical company criteria will be qualified invited to participate in the clinical performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor. In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical company criteria demonstrate that: 1. based on the vendor responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; 2 the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any representation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. The following equally weighted Technical Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: 1. Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Specimen Transport Bags products. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort. a. At a minimum this includes Specimen Transport Bags in the sizes of 6 to 8 inches wide X 6 to 9 inches in length, with and without document pouch protectors, and with the red and black biohazard symbol preprinted on the exterior.The Specimen Transport Bags MUST also be recloseable, transparent plastic, with a single or double seal device and must be latex free safe.

Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative. Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets. 2. Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical performance criteria in a clinical patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range. The scale descriptors are: 1 not acceptable, 2 minimally acceptable, 3 acceptable, 4 more acceptable and 5 highly acceptable. 3. All clinical performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical performance evaluation period will last for one calendar day. The TPRB has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.The TPRB will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.00 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores i.e. a gap between vendors average scores. In addition, the TPRB may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold. Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process DSCP approval. 4. To determine acceptability, the TriService Product review Board TPRB, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a nonclinical, nonpatient care setting. The following Clinical Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: 1. Patient Safety Goal 7 reduces the risk of health care associated infections. The Specimen Transport Bags securely seals with a recloseable locking type device. a. Maintaining a sealed Specimen Transport Bag is important to avoid from items from sliding falling out of the bag and causing cross contamination. The reclosable specimen transport bag protects healthcare personnel from specimen leaks. b. The evaluator will hold the Specimen Transport Bag with one hand and applying gentle pressure with the fingers of the other hand, grasp the recloseable lock device at one end and press down on lock, sliding it from one end to the other, securing the locking device into place per manufacturers specifications. 2. Patient Safety Goal 7 reduces the risk of healthcare associated infections. The Specimen Transport Bag does not leak. a. Providing a seal to the Specimen transport Bag is important to reduce the potential risk of infections in the event the infectious sample inside leaks. b. The evaluator will pour 10mls one large Red top Blood collection tube full of water and after sealing the zip lock device, hold the Specimen Transport Bag with both hands and drop it from waist high while visually inspecting for any leakage from any area of the bag. 3. Patient Safety Goal 7 reduces the risk of healthcare associated infections. The document protector easily opens without opening the recloseable locking type device. a. Providing an easy accessible document pouch is important to avoid from items from sliding falling out of the bag and causing cross contamination. The reclosable specimen transport bag protects healthcare personnel from specimen leaks. b. The evaluator will hold the specimen bag on the top or reclosable locking type device side and slide the other hand into the document protector, fully opening up the pouch. Pricing Analysis Process. Upon completion of the Phase I Technical Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technical acceptable will be qualified invited to provided their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast Region. Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM EST, fourteen calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration participation. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor best tiered pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80 percent of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. Clinical performance and technical company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. The Technical Company and Clinical Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year, 24 months, from date of selection with three 12 month option periods not to exceed 5 years.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: 1.Impact of RIA prices on the Region. Post Standardization Costs. This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendor products, and the products that could not be matched. It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. 2.Impact of Unmatched Lines. The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor. Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs. 3. Consideration of SKUs by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 4. Potential Cost Avoidance. Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement, DAPA, price and multiplying by 12 months of usage. This is included as a reporting Matrix. POC: Ginny Slayton,706-787-2019,FAX:706-787-1099.<BR> <BR>

<DESC><p>This is not a solicitation, but a Notice of Contract Action. The United States Air Force (USAF), Holloman Air Force Base, 49th Contracting Squadron, intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) purchase order to Ingram Library Services. The Ingram Library Service contract will allow Holloman AFB to purchase 600 titles per year. Over the years, attempts have been made to obtain subscriptions from other library vendors. These ventures have turned out to be unsuccessful because either we had to purchase everything at one time, which isn't cost effective to the government, or purchases were limited to a vendors list of titles which the librarian was required to choose from, usually new releases and popular fiction titles which we already obtain through a McNaughton Lease Plan. This also proved to be ineffective because purchases were made, in order to spend the subscription allowance, that weren't particularly useful to the Holloman community. A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This announcement is not a request for competitive quotations. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, not later than 1630, 2 Sep 2008, referencing F2E3LB8185A001, to Amn Kanon Morris, Contract Administrator, kanon.morris@holloman.af.mil. The government will review all responses, without prejudice, and determine if another firm is capable of fulfulling the Library Book Subscription requirement.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY—The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate a contract for the Shortage Destination Branch on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Office of Sponsored Research, 104 Airport Drive, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-1350. The purpose of this procurement is to make key revisions and update the recently proposed new methodology for designation of Medically Underserved Populations (MUPs) and Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) in response to comments received during the public comment period. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Designation of MUPs and HPSAs was published in February 2008 and over 700 comments were received. Based on a review of these comments, the Agency plans to revise the proposed methodology. In order to do so, additional data analyzation is required to revise the statistical model and recalculate the results with updated data. The anticipated period performance is three (3) months. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541690.                                                                                            

The proposed contract action(s) is for services which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1. A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) is on file, which states and supports that University of Carolina at Chapel Hill is the only vendor capable of performing the tasks for this project because they developed and performed the impact testing on the original statistical model for the methodology. Additionally, no other organization has the current data files needed to conduct this testing. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

The contact person for this requirement is Carolyn Cunningham, Contract Specialist, Division of Procurement Management (DPM), OFM/HRSA, Parklawn Building, Room 13A-19, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; phone number (301) 443-6508.

Past performance is significantly more important than price. Each offeror will receive one of the following Performance Confidence Assessment ratings: (1) Substantial Confidence - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort (2) Satisfactory Confidence - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. (3) Limited Confidence - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. (4) No Confidence - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. (5) Unknown Confidence - No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. If the lowest price evaluated responsible offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" Performance Confidence Assessment, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. Completed past performance questionnaires (attached) shall be submitted to the contracting office (Fax: 210-536-3380) Questionnaires shall be completed by offerors' references. Failure to provide properly completed past performance questionnaires may result in the offer being determined non-responsive. Using past performance questionnaires, the Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offerors' experience deemed relevant to the requirements of the RFP. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources, such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources to assess experience. Provide a list of at least two (2) and not more than five (5) of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last 3 years. Relevant contracts are defined as those that are similar in nature and magnitude to this requirement as well as the recency of past performance. Recency is defined as contracts for the Federal agencies and commercial customers that have been performed within the last 3 years from this solicitation date. Furnish the following information for each contract referenced: (1) Company/Division Name, (2) Service, (3) Contracting Agency, (4) Contract Number, (5) Contract Dollar Value, (6) Period of Performance, (7) Name, Address, and phone number of the Contracting Officer or person responsible for evaluation of your performance.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. This is a Request For Quote (RFQ) and the solicitation number is F2VUJ08185AC06. The 6th Contracting Squadron, MacDill AFB, Florida, requires the following software licenses as well as maintenance and support for one base year and two option years.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>USSOCOM requires the capability to maintain and sustain current operational capabilities to support forensic analysis and operational security (OPSEC) analysis requirements for all networks and devices within their architecture. USSOCOM networks' defense-in-depth requirements, as directed by CJCSI 6510.01D, Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (CND), support the warfighter in the global war on terrorism by providing a secure transport of data to and from worldwide locations. One of the aspects of this requirement is to provide analysis capability of data that is transported or resides on our networks. Software must provide USSOCOM the capability to monitor, investigate, remediate and protect all networks against malicious intrusion, security incidents and cyber attacks. Loss of current capability is not acceptable. Without the forensic and recovery capability, USSOCOM would lose the overall visibility of potential risks and lack the capability to quickly remove and sanitize data that, if accessed by unauthorized personnel or hackers, can be used to initiate loss of services or compromise data. This type of activity will pose additional risks to operational SOF missions worldwide.</p>
<p>Proposed solution for USSOCOM must:</p>
<p>&bull; provide a scalable integrated platform to immediately respond to and thoroughly investigate computer-related incidents or events of interest<br />&bull; rapidly and thoroughly investigate computer incidents occurring on any and all nodes within USSOCOM's network, regardless of physical or network location; must provide ability to review both unique closed networks and standalone systems<br />&bull; identify and address internal and external network security, information assurance, and counterintelligence threats before they erupt into significant events<br />&bull; capture and analyze volatile data, including active network sessions, open files, and running processes<br />&bull; verify data files and structure to determine possible compromise<br />&bull; investigate and analyze devices running on all standard commercial operating systems<br />&bull; investigate and analyze devices over local area and wide-area networks from a central location<br />&bull; detect and identify hidden, cloaked or deleted data and/or files<br />&bull; provide analysis without disrupting business processes or alerting targets<br />&bull; audit individual or multiple machines for sensitive information, unauthorized processes and unauthorized network connections<br />&bull; identify and remediate rootkits<br />&bull; remediate or stop security events as they are identified <br />&bull; locate, analyze and capture data in a forensically sound fashion (e.g., without modification to data or device) from any network-connected node without system downtime<br />&bull; analysis and data capture must hold a legal evidentiary capability<br />&bull; proactively and reactively, locate and eliminate classified data spillage <br />&bull; identify unauthorized active programs running on network(s) to include peer-to-peer communications, covert channels and alternate data streams<br />&bull; allow analysts and technicians to access multiple files/folders across an array of servers<br />&bull; accommodate the analysis of terabytes of data based on multi-layered security (classifications)<br />&bull; isolate data needed to be extracted <br />&bull; provide a sanitization capability to clean area of contamination to level of acceptance defined by DoD and NSA standards<br />&bull; comply with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and the resulting NIST interpretation detailed in Special Publication 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.<br />&bull; provide updates to ensure current signatures and libraries are maintained to meet the day-to-day threats and vulnerabilities identified as possible risks to network(s)<br />&bull; provide on-call support to assist in recovery and management of data, files and services<br />&bull; include software maintenance support to remediate and/or fix any deficiency releases needed to eliminate minor problems occurring after a major release; includes all system and security patches as well as required fixes<br />&bull; provide technical support to assigned personnel to ensure the continued operations with no lapse in current capability<br />&bull; respond to information detection system alerts to verify device(s) compromised<br />&bull; identify deviations from system baselines during INFOCON support to verify integrity of critical devices<br />&bull; be operational not later than 1 October 2008. Note: The vendor must provide a plan/timeline to have the system fully operational by the stated deadline.</p>

Provide any <br />specialized tools or equipment, i.e. cabling or connectors, <br />necessary for connection to multiple hardware platforms and <br />devices</p>

device. Specifically, the system must utilize a print head to selectively
deposit and cure cross sections of a digital model by accurately printing each
cross section on the surface of a build plate/tray using a photosensitive
polymer. The system must have a precision Z-stage (elevator) system to
reposition the build platform in very small increments as low as 16 microns or
0.0006 of an inch, such that one thin layer can be reliably printed and
cured/solidified directly onto the previously cured/solidified layer beneath
it. The system must be highly automated; user friendly and capable of
unattended operation once the system is started.<span>&nbsp; </span>All equipment must have the ability to operate as one complete

<DESC>Hoptel UnitsThe Veterans Affairs Medical Center Lebanon Pennsylvania  provides free, temporary, overnight accommodations - the Hoptel - to eligible veterans receiving VHA health care services. Temporary lodging is provided on a first-come, first-served basis and on the availability of temporary lodging beds. In order to receive temporary lodging and/or Hoptel services, a veteran must be required to travel either 50 or more miles or at least two hours from their home to the VA health care facility. The VA health care facility Director may make an exception to distance or time provisions based on exceptional circumstances, such as condition of the veteran, inclement weather, road conditions, or the mode of transportation used by the veteran. This service is for veterans undergoing surgery or therapeutic/diagnostic procedures on an ambulatory basis. The Hoptel is also used to increase access to services for patients who live far from VA V A Medical Center Lebanon sites. Under special circumstances, family members may be allowed to stay in the Hoptel while the veteran is staying there. The Hoptel is a self-care program. You need to make arrangements to use the Hoptel with your Primary Care Physician or Surgeon in advance if you believe you will need to stay overnight. For example: "	during treatment, e.g. radiation therapy, when this would provide a convenient and/or economic alternative to repeated travel to the medical center "	early morning appointments requiring the patient to arrive the night before "	inclement weather "	irregular commercial transportation schedules "	other compelling reasons preventing timely departure of patients At the time of lodging, the veteran must be clinically stable and capable of self-care or be accompanied by a caregiver able to provide the necessary care. VA does not provide nursing or other medical care for temporary lodging beds. Family members and/or caregivers may reside in temporary lodging facilities only with the veteran. If a veteran staying in Hoptel with a family member is admitted to an inpatient bed, alternative lodging arrangements must be made for the family member through a referral to a social worker. Minor children may not be accommodated in temporary lodging.

The Minneapolis VA Medical Center has a VISN 23 need for a standardization of imaging protocols. Standardization of imaging protocols will allow for the best possible collection and consistent interpretation of diagnostic image data. The Imaging Service Line requests a vendor to provide services to VISN 23 to facilitate the standardization of CT, MRI, Ultrasound and Direct Radiology (DR) imaging protocols on each of the Philips Medical Systems CT Scanners MR, Ultrasound and DR systems currently installed at VISN 23 facilities. The sites with academic affiliates include Iowa City, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska; Minneapolis, Minnesota and Des Moines, Iowa (Central Iowa). It is expected that the successful vendor will work with Philips Medical Systems and their recommended protocols. Phase one of this project will be the collection and evaluation of protocols currently utilized on the imaging equipment and Philips recommended protocols for each configuration of scanner/system. A summary of the variability between the VISNs protocols and those that are recommended by Philips will be developed as well as documentation that characterized the variability in protocols that exists from one VISN scanner to another. Based upon the summary of protocols, a report detailing the current state of the protocols will be prepared. This report will be distributed to VISN 23 and Philips Clinical Education Department. The vendor will review the report with Philips Clinical Education Department in order to gather analytical feedback and updated protocol recommendations. The vendor will review the report and Philips feedback with select committee members consisting of VISN 23 Radiologists and their affiliates. Upon conclusion of the sessions, a general consensus shall be formulated. The outcome of standardized protocols decided upon by the select committee with input from Philips Clinical Education Department will be presented to all radiologists who read exams for VISN 23 facilities. The resulting standard protocols will be distributed to radiologists who read exams for VISN 23 facilities for their review and perspectives. Finally, a consensus will be reached about the final standard protocols. The Vendors final results will be the establishment of a Protocol Book for distribution to all VISN 23 facilities.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

FAR 52.215-1 -- Instructions to Offerors -- Competitive Acquisition  (Jan 2004)
(a) Definitions. As used in this provision --
“Discussions” are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer’s discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.”
“In writing,” “writing,” or “written” means any worded or numbered expression which can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information.
“Proposal modification” is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation’s closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award.
“Proposal revision” is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations.
“Time,” if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day.
(b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s).
(c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.
(1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages
(i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and
(ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision.
(2) The first page of the proposal must show --
(i) The solicitation number;
(ii) The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available);
(iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item;
(iv) Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the offeror’s behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and
(v) Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal. Proposals signed by an agent shall be accompanied by evidence of that agent’s authority, unless that evidence has been previously furnished to the issuing office.
(3) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.
(i) Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modification, or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due.
(ii)
(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and --
(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or
(2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(3) It is the only proposal received.
(B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award.
(4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items.
(5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.
(6) Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award.
(7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer.
(8) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer.
(d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror).
(e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall --
(1) Mark the title page with the following legend:
This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and
(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
(f) Contract award.
(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.
(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government’s best interest to do so.
(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.
(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
(11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:
(i) The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer.
(ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror.
(iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
(iv) A summary of the rationale for award.
(v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
(vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database; 
(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;
(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

Length of service<BR>includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<BR>successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<BR>performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<BR><BR>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<BR>King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<BR>Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A<BR>contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<BR>accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR><BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as<BR>numbered):<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any<BR>employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or<BR>professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer<BR>System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than<BR>$27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour<BR>would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage<BR>rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those<BR>job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate<BR>for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates<BR>that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour<BR>conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example, if an<BR>individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope<BR>of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which<BR>this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for<BR>that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures<BR>described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.<BR><BR>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<BR>industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<BR>professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<BR>who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<BR>consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<BR>specifications;<BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<BR>modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<BR>related to user or system design specifications;<BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<BR>programs related to machine operating systems; or<BR>    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<BR>requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you<BR>work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<BR>and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<BR> If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<BR>regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<BR>premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<BR>(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<BR>overtime work).<BR><BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<BR>employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<BR>in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This<BR>includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<BR>ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<BR>and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or<BR>explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance<BR>operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All<BR>operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<BR><BR>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<BR>represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<BR>ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<BR>which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<BR>employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<BR>like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<BR>incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials<BR>are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<BR>ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<BR>(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<BR>local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<BR>laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<BR>employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<BR>determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR>following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<BR>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<BR>cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<BR>the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<BR>this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<BR>agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<BR>affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<BR>and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in<BR>those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear<BR>materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<BR>not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR>laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<BR>of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<BR>there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<BR><BR>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<BR>Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006,<BR>unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<BR>links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<BR>http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web<BR>site at http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<BR>not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<BR>be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<BR>determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<BR>relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<BR>classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such<BR>conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<BR>fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by<BR>the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<BR>of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<BR>be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<BR>When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<BR>should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<BR>conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<BR>occupation) and computes a proposed rate).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<BR>proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<BR>proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage<BR>rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<BR>authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<BR>representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the<BR>contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<BR>performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<BR>of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<BR>information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<BR>and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<BR>for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<BR>disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<BR>notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<BR>the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<BR><BR>When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of<BR>Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<BR>that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<BR>wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<BR>determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<BR>Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<BR>classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>	<BR><BR>

I.  Description:

The National Institute of Standard and Technology’s (NIST’s) National Center for Standards and Certification Information (NCSCI) in the Global Standards and Information Group (GSIG) within the Standards Services Division (SSD) seeks to purchase the services of a contractor to develop and implement a supplementary course consisting of electronic materials to be presented in tandem with and in support of a developed, existing 5-day classroom training course.  Course topics are the establishment and operation of a national Enquiry Point, Notification Authority, and standards information center as mandated under the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (WTO TBT).  

The supplementary course of electronic materials should support, improve and diversify the existing training materials through, for example, new presentation formats (using various and state-of-the-art web compatible applications and capabilities), design and presentational creativity.

At the conclusion of a presentation of the combined supplementary course materials and the existing course, participants, in the context of the WTO, will have an improved and enhanced visual, auditory, and participatory experience that enables them to understand how and be able to establish, operate, and maintain a national WTO TBT Enquiry Point, Notification Authority, and standards information center.

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority countries in crisis.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeting key political transition and stabilization needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the “bullpen”, serving on intermittent/part-time contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in the field and in Washington.  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals must be prepared to work both in the field and in Washington, often with little time for preparations.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

The incumbent serves as an OTI advisor on Information Technology (IT) in support of OTI’s internal operations, and will also be asked to provide assistance to non-OTI organizations including OTI implementing partners in furtherance of OTI program objectives.  Advice and assistance will be provided in the area of OTI information systems (including systems analysis, database design, and training) for OTI and OTI implementing partners.  Advice and assistance will also be provided in analyzing OTI business practices, to recommend improvements to business systems where appropriate.  

The incumbent has a direct role in both the operations and the program activities of DCHA/OTI, learning from both in order to develop more effective systems and processes to further the implementation of transition programming overseas. The incumbent will, as needed, serve as a part of the DCHA/OTI country program activities as well as develop and maintain the systems that individuals in those program roles will use.  This may involve, for example, short-term assignments to backstop or assist OTI Program Managers and others in the country program team or operations team when required in order to better understand the existing business processes, information flows, and types of data managed. This analysis should lead to the development of improved information system tools supporting transition programming.  

The incumbent will gain a keen understanding of OTI's operational and programmatic goals and combine this knowledge with a strong background in information technology to provide consultation on the development of OTI’s information systems.  Assignments may involve temporary duty at any of OTI’s overseas development offices, as well as assignments to be performed from home or in the Washington office.

OTI uses a Microsoft Access database to track and report on country program small grants and other activities overseas.  The database system gives OTI an ability to manage and explain to others a diverse portfolio of OTI activities in many countries.  The incumbent will: provide support to OTI Washington-based staff as well as OTI and Implementing Partner staff overseas; create enhancements to the program and ensure that the system maintains consistency with the program strategies and structures in each OTI country; and support and review the processes inherent in program management that maintain information flow to OTI managers, partners and stakeholders.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this solicitation is to provide on-call information technology specialist capabilities to the OTI Bullpen.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Because of the need for quick response and creativity in complex situations, the incumbent is expected to operate with certain levels of autonomy, responsibility and authority. The sensitive nature of the work demands that the incumbent be an individual with sound judgment, good teamwork, interpersonal, and analytical skills while also possessing a well-developed understanding of US policy interests. While the individual will be reporting directly to the Chief, Field Programs Division, given the close collaboration between the Field Programs Division, the Operations and Management Division, and the Program Office, it is extremely important that the individual maintain professional and collaborative ties between the divisions given the amount of cross-over between the various teams.  The incumbent must have a strong background and interest in information system design.  The incumbent must also have experience and interest in program implementation, and be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice.  Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the incumbent must be highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.

While the majority of the duties will take place in Washington, DC, the incumbent will also be sent, on an as needed basis, to a wide range of OTI project sites and proposed new country program sites.  The incumbent will report to the OTI Chief of Field Programs or his/her designee, and also collaborate closely with the Operations Division Technology Specialist.  

The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:  

•	Participate in planning, implementation, maintenance and support of OTI’s information management systems, including the OTI Activity Database, OTI Budget and Finance database, information sharing systems, collaboration systems, and other operational systems supporting the implementation of OTI transition programs, in close collaboration with the OTI Technology Specialist;. 

•	In collaboration with the OTI Technology Specialist, investigate and propose opportunities to incorporate new technologies for use in OTI’s information management systems and in OTI’s programs that will help OTI meet its operational and programmatic objectives;  

•	Assist the OTI Technology Specialist in reviewing Agency systems, policies, technical requirements and security requirements with respect to OTI’s information systems and business processes to ensure these systems are integrated with agency systems and adhere to agency policies and procedures;

•	In collaboration with the OTI Technology Specialist, train OTI Washington and field staff as needed on operations and management processes, which may include using OTI information management systems across all OTI programs worldwide (e.g. providing orientation to implementing program processes in conjunction with supporting information systems).  Assist staff in obtaining IT support from designated sources, or provide direct support where appropriate.  This includes but is not limited to providing small group or one-on-one training, and writing end-user documentation; 

•	When requested, and in collaboration with the OTI Technology Specialist and/or the OTI Program Office Team Leader, provide technical assistance to OTI web coordinators in maintaining OTI’s various web sites on the agency’s Internet, extranet and intranet web servers;

•	If requested by the Technology Specialist, assist in coordinating with the USAID Office of Information Resources Management, the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in their provision of IT support to OTI, and other offices or bureaus to leverage existing agency IT resources and maximize the effect of OTI's independent resources;

•	In collaboration with the Technology Specialist, perform assessments of OTI business processes and design information systems to support OTI's program activities.  These systems may include: operational and programmatic information systems such as personnel, inventory, scheduling, annual reports; communication and collaboration tools such as websites, email tools, file sharing tools; programmatic tactical technology solutions such as PDA solutions, wireless and web-based systems. The incumbent will undertake special projects in conjunction with these assessments that may include assignments evaluating specific roles that are key to OTI business processes;  

•	Special projects may include short-term assignments that involve requirements analysis accomplished in part through performance of business processes such as those listed below in order to assess appropriate changes to OTI information management systems, or adjustments to program processes that will result in improved program performance and effectiveness: 

•	Participate with country program teams on strategic planning, decision-making, and implementation through consultation with Field Programs staff;
•	Assist in oversight of program contracts and support the CTO in facilitating good information sharing and flow of reporting between OTI and contractors;
•	Manage information flow for review, evaluation and assessment of country program;
•	Participate in design and implementation of new country program operations to include management, logistical, budget, administrative and contractual issues;
•	Perform other activities as required for the successful completion of country programs;

•	Perform other duties and activities as required and as related to this scope of work for the successful completion of the OTI mandate;

•	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI IT Specialist, or team leader for IT if requested by the Technology Specialist and approved by the Supervisor, or acting Program Manager within an OTI regional team (either in Washington or in the field) if requested by the Supervisor;

•	Mentor/train other OTI IT staff, Program Managers, and/or field-based staff as required; and,

•	Travel overseas in fulfillment of duties, as required.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Information Technology (IT) Advisor will take direction from and will report to the OTI Chief of Field Programs or his/her designee, and also collaborate closely with the Operations Division Technology Specialist.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
While the Supervisor will set overall objectives, the incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p>1) Please confirm these finished interior dimensions; 7'-8" X 13'-10" X<br />7'-2"<br />2) We are planning to provide a 3'-0" door <br />3) We have seized the appropriate heater for sauna -- however what is the<br />'current' volts, #-phase &amp; AMP Electrical service available and is it<br />anticipated to remain as the same source/ spec unchanged for the new heater<br />unless <br />manufacturer requires different volts, #-phase &amp; Amp service?<br />4) We have arranged for (assuming if/when appropriation and award) standby<br />potential FOB shipping of all custom components involved to the Travis AFB<br />-- However it will require two-men at site to unload materials and set<br />nearby point of replacement. Shall we coordinate this 'unloading' with your<br />personnel or we shall plan to meet the carrier on/with our own personnel, no<br />problem. &lt;--- The latter would be most efficient provided we could also<br />begin our work the same day (or day after) as well then. Just a thought to<br />keep in mind for implementation procedures.<br />5)Please define the following: Is the existing sub/wall framing<br />(sub-structure) metal studs?...Wood? and if so wood, 2x4 or 2x6? (perhaps<br />just measure the door jamb width please) This will also help us to determine<br />if there is a layer of plywood backing or gypsum in place. ---&gt;OR Are we to<br />remove completely the old framing, insulation, wiring...etc and<br />rebuild/replace all new framing and related materials to accommodate a newly<br />sized/configured Sauna?<br />This is what the end user sent</p>
<p>1. Yes, those are the correct dimensions.<br />2. Currently we have 3'0' existing door.<br />3. Currently in use: controller 120/208-240, 3 wire, 40 AMP 30 60 cycle in<br />use<br />4. We can provide Fitness personnel to assist in unloading.<br />5. Wood 2X4.</p>

The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.**<br />This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26 and Defense DCN 20080812. The associated Standard Classification (SIC) is 1795. The North American Industry Classification System is 238910 and the business size standard is $14M. The Federal Supply Class (FSC) is Z149.

Offeror must quote cost of total requirement by breaking out labor cost which is part of the total cost.</p>
<p>FOB is Travis Air Force Base. The following provisions or clauses apply to this acquisition. Offerors must comply with all instruction contained in FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-2-Evaluation- Commercial Items paragraph (a) to this provision is completed as follows: EVALUATION CRITERIA: The Government will award the contract resulting form the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the requirement will be the most advantageous to the Government, past performance and price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1. PAST PERFORMANCE 2. PRICE Past Performance is significantly more important than price when being evaluated. Provide up to three (3) sources (list Government source/s if available) as a reference of the most recent and *relevant past and present contracts performed within the last three (3) years. The Government will contact those sources provided by the offeror with a past performance survey.</p>
<p>(1) Furnish the following information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Company/division name<br />b. Product/service<br />c. Contracting agency<br />d. Contract number<br />e. Contract dollar value<br />f. Period of Performance<br />g. Name, address, email address, FAX number, and telephone number of the Contracting Officer and Functional Area Chief.<br />h. Comments regarding compliance with the contract terms and conditions.<br />i. Comments regarding any known performance deemed not acceptable to the customer or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance Survey: The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's experience deemed relevant to the requirement. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror's sources to assess past and present performance.<br /><br />*Relevancy definitions are as follows:</p>
<p>Very Relevant -- Present/past performance efforts involving demolition of gas and steam operated incinerators which are similar or greater than this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant -- Present/past performance efforts involved in demolishing either gas or steam operated incinerators.<br />Somewhat Relevant -- Present/past performance contractual efforts involved some type of demolition project but not for gas or steam operated incinerators.<br />Not Relevant -- Present/past performance did not involve any demolition projects of any type.<br /><br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive selection in which competing offerors past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions To Offerors, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the unit price for each item to confirm the extended amount for each, if applicable.</p>
<p>B. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving the requirement that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "High Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the requirement, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of High Confidence, Significant Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Unknown Confidence, Little Confidence, or No Confidence, as defined in AFFARS MP5315.3, Table 3. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>C. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in the requirement.</p>
<p>D. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "High Confidence" performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>E. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "High Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "High Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated.

<p>FOB is Travis Air Force Base. The following provisions or clauses apply to this acquisition. Offerors must comply with all instruction contained in FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-2-Evaluation- Commercial Items paragraph (a) to this provision is completed as follows: EVALUATION CRITERIA: The Government will award the contract resulting form the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the requirement will be the most advantageous to the Government, past performance and price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1. PAST PERFORMANCE 2. PRICE Past Performance is significantly more important than price when being evaluated. Provide up to three (3) sources (list Government source/s if available) as a reference of the most recent and *relevant past and present contracts performed within the last three (3) years. The Government will contact those sources provided by the offeror with a past performance survey.</p>
<p>(1) Furnish the following information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Company/division name<br />b. Product/service<br />c. Contracting agency<br />d. Contract number<br />e. Contract dollar value<br />f. Period of Performance<br />g.

Comments regarding compliance with the contract terms and conditions.<br />i. Comments regarding any known performance deemed not acceptable to the customer or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance Survey: The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's experience deemed relevant to the requirement. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror's sources to assess past and present performance.<br /><br />*Relevancy definitions are as follows:</p>
<p>Very Relevant -- Present/past performance efforts involving demolition of gas and steam operated incinerators which are similar or greater than this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant -- Present/past performance efforts involved in demolishing either gas or steam operated incinerators.<br />Somewhat Relevant -- Present/past performance contractual efforts involved some type of demolition project but not for gas or steam operated incinerators.<br />Not Relevant -- Present/past performance did not involve any demolition projects of any type.<br /><br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive selection in which competing offerors past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions To Offerors, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the unit price for each item to confirm the extended amount for each, if applicable.</p>
<p>B. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving the requirement that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "High Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the requirement, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of High Confidence, Significant Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Unknown Confidence, Little Confidence, or No Confidence, as defined in AFFARS MP5315.3, Table 3. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>C. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in the requirement.</p>
<p>D. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "High Confidence" performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>E. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "High Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "High Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>F. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>

 (vi) DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS: STATEMENT OF NEED: The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) mission is to enforce the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and other laws that are designed to protect consumers’ health and safety.  Several Information Technology (IT) systems have been created to meet mission critical requirements as well as requirements imposed by executive orders.  These systems assist FDA personnel in tracking and managing cases throughout the regulatory workflow.  Furthermore, for better support of decision support processes, the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) has developed the Online Reporting Analysis Decision Support System (ORADSS) data warehouse.  ORADSS is a centralized data warehouse environment implemented to provide integrated decision support for regulatory compliance.  This effort involved establishing a central repository of information that supports FDA in achieving its mission of protecting the public from unsafe food, drugs, cosmetics, electronic radiation emitting products, and medical devices, whether of domestic or foreign origin.  Specifically, ORADSS has been designed to support the FDA user community in researching, analyzing, and reporting on domestic and foreign operations, product information through its standard and dynamic querying, ad hoc and standard report generation, and trend analysis capabilities.
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:  The vendor shall provide:  1) INFORMATICA MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT: ORADSS uses Informatica PowerCenter as our Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) Tool.

In addition, the vendor shall provide support for future upgrades to the ORADSS Informatica environment during the term of the support period.

<p>This is NOT a request for proposal (RFP). NO solicitation is being issued at this time, and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Any information provided by industry to the government as a result of this sources sought notice is voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlement to payment or direct or indirect costs or charges to the government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to the government. The information obtained from industry in response to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP.</p>
<p>
<p>The USAF Academy has a requirement for a ground-based fast-tracking/steering telescope (FTT) and mount for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite imaging, as well as classical astronomy and astrophysics applications. The telescope and mount will be installed, tested and operated in this government provided facility, located in the Cadet Area of USAFA (Colorado Springs, CO). It is the government's intent to have one primary contractor, who will oversee the design and construction of the telescope and mount. The government is pursuing separate avenues to provide a facility to house the telescope, to include the enclosure, dome, pier and appropriate power and communications capabilities.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to construct the fast steering mount and Optical Tube Assembly (OTA) to include primary mirror support (cell), truss, secondary mirror and assembly, tertiary mirror and assembly, and two Nasmyth-style instrument platforms, together with the control software and electronics necessary to fully operate this system. In addition, the successful offeror will be required to fully interface the telescope control system with the government furnished facility, to include design parameters for the facility to insure operability of the OTA and mount. The contractor will also be expected to provide operation and maintenance training as well as detailed documentation. The primary contractor will work closely with other contractors as well as the government when installing the telescope, in order to ensure that all specifications are met.<br />At minimum, potential sources are requested to provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Evidence they have completed similar type of work, including design, construction, and integration of 2 meter class telescopes on schedule and within original budget.</p>
<p>2. Ability to subcontract as necessary to qualified sources, and to oversee such subcontracts. Alternatively, the ability to team with other contractors on the original proposal to accomplish same.</p>
<p>3. Evidence of relevant team expertise, such as qualified optical engineers, software engineers, and mechanical/structural engineers.</p>
<p>4. While the telescope and mount is not envisioned as an operational AF asset, the telescope will be primarily used for satellite imaging and other Space Situational Awareness (SSA) activities. Accordingly, we request evidence of substantial experience (3 years or more) working in these areas, and evidence of awareness of current DoD Space Situational Awareness (SSA) operational requirements.</p>
<p>5. Evidence the potential contractor has engaged in this type of business for over 5 (five) years, has the necessary equipment, personnel, and financial resources to fulfill the requirements of this contract.</p>
<p>6. Demonstration of capability to comply with the Buy American Act.</p>
<p>7. A description and percentage of work most likely to be subcontracted, and what percentage of the subcontracted work small businesses could/would perform. This information will be used to establish small business subcontracting goals.</p>
<p>8. In the event a government facility is not completed prior to anticipated delivery, the government would like to know an estimated cost of storage per month of the finished assembly.</p>
<p>Attached are the draft specifications associated with this telescope and mount requirement.</p>
<p>Notice: Non-government personnel will be involved in this acquisition as technical advisors. The advisors are working for the following company: Valdez International Corporation, 1490 Garden of the Gods Road, Suite B, Colorado Springs, CO 80907. Valdez is under contract with the Academy to provide Research &amp; Development support.</p>
<p>All respondents are requested to indicate business size status in relation to the applicable NAICS code 333314 (Size Standard 500 employees). Also identify and address if your firm is 8(a), women owned, HUBZone, or otherwise classified as a small disadvantaged business. All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines capabilities in providing all of the above mentioned requirements with respect to the provided specifications. The capabilities packages should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated. The response should not exceed 25 pages, single-spaced, 10 point typed. Please submit one hard copy on or before 30 May 2008 to Mr. Jan K. Christensen, 10 MSG/LGCW, 8110 Industrial Dr, US Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs CO 80840, and one electronic copy via email to the follwing address: jan.christensen@usafa.af.mil.
