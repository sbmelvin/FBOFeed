<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine a requirement for a three-year contract to collaborate with CDC's TB Trials Consortium in a phase 2 trial of moxifloxacin versus ethambutol in the 4-drug intensive phase of treatment of tuberculosis.  Through its field collaboration with Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, Case Western can assure access to large numbers of patients with active TB disease who can be enrolled within 7 days of the start of TB therapy, treated with FDA-approved companion medications, and monitored by an experienced clinical staff able to comply with FDA requirements for Good Clinical Practices.  The site must also have ready access to a fully qualified mycobacteriology laboratory, and must be experienced in data management for large scale clinical trials, and must have an available ethics committee meeting all Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) requirements.   The site must be capable of enrolling 150 patients over the course of two years, and following patients during the full six months of TB treatment.   Moreover, because costly supplies of study drugs and matching placebo will expire in early 2005, the site must be able promptly to begin enrollment immediately following the expected award date of April 1, 2003.  Case Western is the only known contractor with the unique capacity in the area of TB clinical trials AND who possesses the current capacity to satisfy the stringent time requirements for this procurement.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by notifying Cynthia R. Collins by email at coc9@cdc.gov or by facsimile at 770-488-2688.  Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to extend the current Program Analysis and Control contract with QSS Group, Inc., for a period of one to four months and increase the value on a sole source basis, to provide continuation of services until a follow-on contract is in place. The authority for Other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  It is imperative that there be no disruption to performance-based services prior to the follow-on procurement becoming effective.  It would not be economical or feasible to compete a contract for the existing work to cover the proposed one to four month period until the anticipated start of the the resultant contract under the follow-on competition, and would have negative impacts to ongoing missions and flight projects.  In addition, the combination of delay due to the competitive process and the time required by a new contractor to become acquainted with the work and systems (phase-in) would result in substantial adverse delays in fulfilling NASA's Mission.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26.  See note 22.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 7, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) for the acquisition of technical data, contingency repairs, modifications, and analyses of Gulfstream Aircraft.  Currently that consists of one Gulfstream I (GI), three Gulfstream II (GII), and four modified GII Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA).	The technical data required consist of computerized maintenance program (CMP) support, aircraft service change/customer bulletins, parts catalog revision service, and maintenance, flight and wiring diagram manual revision service.  Repairs, modifications, and analyses of the aircraft that are determined to be beyond the capability of the JSC aircraft support services contractor including the incorporation of aircraft service changes, customer bulletins, and other similar items will also be procured.  The proposed effort is for 5 years. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (GAC).  Both the GI and GII aircraft were designed and built by the predecessor companies of GAC.  The design of both aircraft is considered proprietary and therefore not available to other contractors.  The schedule demands of both aircraft types, particularly the STA, require minimum out-of-service times.  GAC has the necessary personnel, facilities, and supplies to expedite the solution of any problems.  The use of the STA aircraft is for critical crew training of astronauts in the landing phase of the Space Shuttle.  The aircraft is equipped with many transducers, sensors, servos, and other sensitive devices not found on a standard aircraft.  Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, through the years of experience in working with the STA is cognizant of the complexity of working with these systems. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. See note 22.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.	Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:        http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<RESPDATE>121102
<ARCHDATE>03112003
<CONTACT>Barbara B. Lawrence, Contracting Officer, (781) 271-8075
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) -- The Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS) System Program Office is seeking to identify qualified, potential Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) Contractors to support US Air Force, US Navy, US Army, and USSOCOM legacy mission planning and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) developments.  JMPS is a software development effort managed collaboratively by the US Air Force, US Navy, US Army, and USSOCOM.  It is the Government's intention to select one or more Systems Engineering and Integration contractor(s) following the conduct of a full and open competition.  As the Systems Engineering and Integration contractor will have enterprise wide influence on future development, the Government is concerned about an organizational conflict of interest (or perception of conflict) relative to participation in subsequent software developments. It is believed that the contractor selected would not be able to develop any future mission planning software components.  Potential offerors will be asked to discuss approaches to preclude this situation. JMPS development utilizes object oriented design and open architecture principles to include well-defined and published interfaces, open source code, software development kits and program plans that future JMPS Enterprise software developers can plan, develop and coordinate their contracted mission planning components.  The mission planning enterprise consists of legacy Air Force, Navy, and Army mission planning systems, JMPS framework, Common Capabilities (CCs) that provide common functionality for multiple platforms and Unique Planning Components (UPCs) that meet the unique requirements for a given platform. The range, scope, and applicability of the following work efforts envisioned being provided by the SE&I contractor might vary for each military service.  With the Government acting as lead, the SE&I contractor(s) will be a partner/partners in the successful accomplishment of the JMPS Enterprise.  To ensure successful integration of JMPS common capabilities and unique planning components the SE&I contractor(s) will have responsibilities involving technical guidance, test processes, and information management.  In accordance with JMPS standards, the SE&I contractor(s) will be responsible for integration into the JMPS framework of common capabilities provided by the development contractors.  The individual UPC development contractors are responsible for integrating all components needed for the mission planning environment for the specific platforms. The Air Force Mission Support Systems (AFMSS) Systems Program Office, Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom AFB Massachusetts would like to obtain information relating to industry's interest in and ability to provide expertise/experience in the following areas associated with Mission Planning System Engineering and Integration: 1) Integrating large, complex software-intensive systems;  2) Configuration management and change control of evolving software components including multiple concurrent baselines;  3) Developing and maintaining roadmaps for concurrent, spiral development and incremental fielding of all mission planning software components as well as the framework;  4) Developing and maintaining knowledge repositories for use by the government and development contractors;  5) Testing software-intensive systems at the component level as well as at the integrated system level;  6) Training developers through Software Development Kits, and wizards;  7) Working on Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) with the Government as well as multiple development contractors;  8) Obtaining DoD security, information assurance, COE, Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), and interoperability certifications;  9) Advising the Government on the management of design or interface change proposal activity and software problem reports especially as they relate to individual development activities across  large software development programs;  10) Architecture engineering especially for top level architecture and data modeling performance;  11) Working with the Mission Planning domain. Responses from contractors wishing to participate as either prime or sub-contractor are desired in order for the Government to gather information on the state of the art techniques of the industry.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI.  The information you provide may be utilized by the Air Force in developing its acquisition strategy and in its Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives and Performance Specifications.  The information resulting from this RFI may be included in one or more RFPs, which will be released to industry. Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights.  However, if proprietary data are included in your reply, please mark it appropriately.  Interested firms are requested to submit information outlining their capabilities and their approach within 30 days of the date of the RFI announcement.  Replies to this RFI should be sent to Ms Barbara Lawrence, Contracting Officer, ESC/ACK, 50 Griffiss Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-1625, Phone (781) 271-8075, email: barbara.lawrence@hanscom.af.mil. It is the Government's intention under market research to hold an Industry Day at the MITRE Complex in Bedford, MA on 16-17 Dec 02.  In addition, an electronic library will be established in the near future.  Details will be provided at the Industry Day.  Finally this office will also be publishing on an as available basis, (draft and final) acquisition documentation on the Hanscom RFP Electronic Bulletin Board (HERBB - http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil).

<SOLNBR>DACA42-03-T-0016
<RESPDATE>121202
<ARCHDATE>02102003
<CONTACT>JEAN STANG, 703/428-6625
<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Tau upgrade to J.Y. Horiba Fluorolog 3 Spectrofluorometer prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitut es the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be used.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 09, dated 09/30/02. Line Item 1.   J.Y. Horiba commercially offers the five (5) major components that are to be integrated into the Fluorolog 3 basic spectrometer as part of the Tau 3 upgrade.  These include the Lifetime accessory (FL-1023), double grating monochromator (FL-1005), thermosta ted sample holder (FL-1012), T-channel optics (FL-1002), T-channel (FL-1031).  The expansion to Tau 3 will also preserve the instruments present capabilities by maintaining the ability to collect intrinsic, stead-state measurements in one complete configu ration.  Finally, the upgrade will improve wavelength sensitivity by replacing single grating Czerny-Turner monochromators with double grating ones. Requirements. ERDC TEC is seeking to upgrade an existing J.Y. Horiba Fluorolog 3 Spectrofluorometer to Tau 3 for performing expanded lifetime and polarization (anisotropy) measurements to characterize fluorophores of military significance.  ERDC TEC is seeking to upgrad e the current Fluorolog 3 configuration to seamlessly switch between steady-state and dynamic (lifetime and polarization) fluorescence measurements without realignment or changes in hardware or platforms.  To accomplish the lifetime characterization of flu orescent molecules, a wide frequency range is required (0.1 to 300 MHz).  Lifetimes as fast as 10 picoseconds to greater than 10 microseconds are also required for specific fluorophores  of interest.  The existing instrument was purchased in FY02 as part o f a research grant from the Defense Research Projects Agency, DARPA.  The present configuration of the instrument is limited to intrinsic, steady state fluorescence using a single grating excitation monochromator.  This configuration has been determined to  be limiting for future types of measurements needed to characterize fluorophores that are being required for the research program in fluorescence remote sensing.  Date/place of delivery and acceptance.  FOB Destination. March 23, 2003 to Topographic Engineering Center (TEC), Data & Signature Analysis Branch, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, Virginia 22315-3964. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial, applies to this acquisition. This is a sole source procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies to this solicitation. Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items, with their offers. The date, time, and place offers are due is as follows: 13 December 2002 at 2:00 PM, to the Vicksburg Consolidated Contracting Office-Alexandria; Major Systems Branch, (Attn:  CEMVK-CT-M) located in the Cude Building 2592 of the Topographic Engineering Center Facility (TEC), 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, Vir ginia 22315-3864.

<SOLNBR>DE-PS26-03NT41713
<RESPDATE>040103
<ARCHDATE>05012003
<CONTACT>Richard Rogus, Contracting Officer, All calls should be directed to the Attention of Martin Byrnes at (412) 386-4486, rogus@netl.doe.gov;Martin Byrnes, Contract Specialist, 412-386-4486, byrnes@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>This solicitation will support the Department of Energy's Carbon Sequestration Program by promoting the development of a framework and infrastructure necessary for the validation, demonstration and wide-scale deployment of carbon sequestration technologies.  The DOE will call for applications and select multiple Regional Partnerships to receive financial assistance awards that would be chartered  to evaluate options and potential opportunities for regional CO2 storage and capture, CO2 transport, regulatory permitting, communication and outreach, public acceptance, monitoring and verification requirements, and environmental efficacy of sequestration in their multi-state region(s).    The DOE plans to fund 4-10 partnerships for a period of up to 24 months.  Total Federal funding for this initiative will be $8-$10 million dollars with a non-Federal cost share of at least 20%. The solicitation will be available on the DOE/NETL's Internet address at http://www.netl.doe.gov/business and on the "Industry Interactive Procurement System" (IIPS) webpage located at http://e-center.doe.gov on or about December 16, 2002. This Notice is to inform an array of organizations including private landowners, mining and power generation industry, oil and gas industry, forest product industry, other commercial businesses, climate change and environmental special interest groups, academicians, community leaders, county/city planners, commissioners, engineers, and the general public of the availability of the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships Solicitation so that these groups can begin collaboration. 1. Background Information: A. Introduction This initiative directly supports the President's Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) goal of reducing greenhouse gas intensity by 18% by 2012 and will help ensure that a suite of commercially-ready sequestration technologies are available for the 2012 technology assessment mandated by the GCCI.  The establishment of several Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships will promote the implementation of the current RD&D technology for the capture, transport, and storage of anthropogenic fossil fuel CO2 emissions across the United States by developing regional solutions. For sequestration to be economically acceptable, the cost and energy penalty associated with CO2 capture must be reduced, the long-term environmental efficacy and safety of CO2 storage must be verified, and an infrastructure amenable to sequestration must be developed.  The geographical differences in fossil fuel use and sequestration sinks across the United States dictates that regional approaches will be required to address the sequestration of CO2. Each partnership will be chartered to develop permitting requirements, initiate public acceptance, develop protocols for the application of the latest advancements in technology from the DOE Carbon Sequestration Program and other RD&D efforts, evaluate these emerging technologies on capture and storage of CO2, and establish the monitoring, verification and accounting protocols required in the event that wide-scale deployment of sequestration technologies becomes necessary. Regionally oriented partnerships represent an important step towards meeting these objectives.  The regional diversity of CO2 sources and storage options calls for a diverse portfolio of strategies for carbon management. Multi-partner collaborations are encouraged.  A Regional Partnership may consist of academia, national laboratories, energy producers and users, non-profit organizations, and state agencies and local agencies indigenous to a specific region.  The multi-state region should be based upon commonality of interests and contributions to the Partnership including the similarity of CO2 sources and storage options.  States in the multi-state region need not be contiguous. B. The Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships Initiative A two-phased approach is being pursued for this Partnership initiative. This Phase I solicitation will result in a detailed framework, conceptual design and cost information for follow-on activities in Phase II, "Implementation and Technology Validation".  Phase II is anticipated to be a separate, open competitive solicitation as a follow-on to Phase I. In Phase I the Regional Partnership shall as a minimum: 1) Define the Geographical Boundaries of the Region.  There will be several approaches for the capture, storage, and sequestration of CO2 that will be required for the United States.  For example, two sinks in the U.S. may have similar geologic characteristics but one of the two may not be suitable for sequestration because of regional conditions (e.g., land use change patterns, seismic considerations, use as a drinking water aquifer). In addition, a region may have a concentration of unique CO2 sources.  These sources could use the same capture technologies and yield a significant reduction of the CO2 emitted from a region.  Regions should be defined based on similarities of CO2 sources, sinks, permitting considerations, partners and other analogous features. 2) Characterize the Region.  Characterize the region relative to sources, sinks, transport, sequestration options, and existing and future infrastructure requirements.   For direct sequestration approaches (i.e., capture and injection of CO2 into geologic reservoirs), partnerships are required to address all of these issues.  For indirect sequestration approaches (e.g., reforestation, agriculture practices), partnerships are required to identify the natural sinks and regional sources of CO2 emissions.  Information gathered during the characterization phase should be archived in a relational database and geographic information system (GIS).  The GIS is essential to analyzing the costs of transport, concentration of sources, capacity of sinks, and the creation of regional carbon accounting methods/protocols. (a) Sources identified within a region must be of collective size that CO2 capture would significantly reduce the total emissions within the region. Information presented should include, but are not limited to, annual emissions of CO2, emissions of other green house gases (GHGs), and locations of large individual sources.  Sources of CO2 can include, but are not limited to, fossil fuel combustion power plants, metals manufacturing facilities, chemical processing plants, ethanol production, natural gas production and fossil fuel energy facilities. (b) Storage options (i.e., sinks) must include the predominant geologic and terrestrial sinks of the defined region. Storage options could include, but are not limited to, geologic reservoirs such as depleted oil/gas reservoirs; unmineable coal seams; saline formations; terrestrial sequestration options such as reforestation of abandoned mine lands; enhancement of unproductive lands; and modifying land management practices on lands with existing carbon stock to increase carbon content. Value-added storage options such as enhanced oil recovery, natural gas production, or growth of timber or agricultural products should be considered. (c) Matching sources/sinks with CO2 transportation issues must be addressed. Transport of the captured CO2 from the source to the sink may be a significant consideration in regional greenhouse gas mitigation strategies.  The Partnerships must analyze options/issues related to transport of CO2 between sources/sinks (e.g. via pipeline, tanker, etc) within the region. Transport options/issues are obviously not applicable to indirect sequestration approaches such as reforestation and agricultural practices. 3)   Identify the Most Promising Capture, Sequestration and Transport Options. Analyze results from Paragraphs 1 & 2 above to identify the most promising regional opportunities for CO2 capture, transport, storage and sequestration (direct or indirect) from the perspective of technical feasibility, safety, estimated cost, perceived public acceptability, CO2 reduction potential, and environmental efficacy.  Technologies assessed for direct capture of CO2 are likely to come from the most promising options emerging from the DOE Carbon Sequestration Program or other related R&D initiatives conducted by academia and industry.  This Regional Partnership initiative is not intended to be a "technology development" initiative.  This initiative should, where possible, assess and validate the most promising emerging technology developments and if necessary, identify minor modifications required to fit the technology(s) to the regional applications.  Near the conclusion of Phase I Partnership activities, these results shall be used to identify and plan small scale, regional technology validation field tests to be conducted if the Partnerships desire to participate and are selected for follow on activity in Phase II Regional Partnership Solicitation.  The results from both Phase I and Phase II activities will ultimately provide prime candidate regional options for future large scale (> 1 million tonnes per year CO2 sequestered) demonstration and deployment opportunities, unrelated to these Regional Partnership solicitations. 4)   Identify and Address Barrier Issues for Wide-Scale Deployment. Conduct a preliminary assessment of safety, regulatory and permitting requirements, public perception, ecosystem impacts, and other potential challenges associated with wide scale deployment of promising regional opportunities selected for CO2 capture, transport, and storage (direct and/or indirect approaches).  The technology(ies) to be evaluated will be those chosen as the most promising opportunities from Paragraph 3.   Develop actions plans to overcome these challenges and begin implementing these plans where possible. 5)  Develop Public Involvement and Education Mechanisms.  Develop public involvement and education action plans that would be applicable in overcoming the potential challenges identified in Paragraph 4 above.  For example, a public involvement plan may consist of, but not limited to, public education in the form of mailing lists, public meetings, media advertising, local interviews and education programs available at libraries, schools, and local businesses. 6)  Prepare Action Plans for Implementation and Technology Validation Activity.  Follow on action plans should be prepared related to implementation of the framework developed leading to small scale regional technology validation field tests identified in Paragraph 3 above. Relative to direct capture options from energy facilities, Partnerships are encouraged to consider cost-effective approaches that provide flexibility for assessing multiple candidate technology options, if appropriate, such as a small slip stream from existing facility. Action plans for implementing Paragraphs 4 & 5 above should address the Partnerships plans forward related to public acceptance, public involvement and education, regulatory, permitting and accounting frameworks necessary for demonstration and wide-scale deployment of the most promising greenhouse gas mitigation strategies identified from this  solicitation. DOE anticipates requiring the following information as part of the application for financial assistance: 1)  A list of participating public and private organizations, descriptions of the roles and responsibilities, and letters of intent for each partner. Regional partnerships can include industry, state and regional governments, non-profit organizations, academia, and national laboratories that collectively possess all relevant expertise and capabilities.  Letters of commitment from all members of the partnership will be required with each application. Those members offering to provide cost-share are also required to provide details of that commitment. 2)   A description of the geographic region as defined by the Partnership including reasons that it should be considered (e.g., concentration of particular type sources or sinks), and factors that make the proposed Partnership necessary for consideration over areas with similar sources or sinks. 3)  A description of the particular region's CO2 sources and potential storage sites including a plan to provide detailed characterization of these sources and potential storage sites. 4)  A description of the potential aggregate amounts of greenhouse gas storage and value-added benefits (such as enhanced oil recovery, enhanced gas recovery, improved forestry/agriculture practices) that could result from the Regional Partnerships. 5)   Identification of environmental efficacy, permitting, and regulatory issues associated with carbon sequestration and any approach for resolving these challenges. 6)  An approach to developing an outreach plan to inform the public of the capabilities and economic benefits of the partnership activities and engage the public in decision-making when appropriate. 7)  A method for conducting technology transfer and information sharing on the results of the project. Eligibility for participation in this Program Solicitation is considered to be full and open.  All interested parties may apply.  The solicitation will contain a complete description of the technical and organizational evaluation factors and the relative importance of each factor.   Applications submitted by or on behalf of 1) another Federal agency; 2) a Federally Funded Research and Development Center sponsored by another Federal agency; or 3) a Department of Energy (DOE) Management Operating (M&O) contractor will not be eligible for award under this solicitation.

<DESC>QF-4 FULL SCALE AERIAL TARGET (FSAT) PRODUCTION FOLLOW-ON CONTRACT ? The Air Armament Center, Aerial Targets SPO, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL, intends to issue a sole-source contract to BAE Systems Flight Systems, Inc, located at 1434 Flight Line Building 58B, Mojave, CA  93501-1665.   This sole source contract will be for the production of QF-4 FSATs, Lots 10-14.   The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 336411 with a size standard of 1,500 employees.   BAE is the prime contractor for the QF-4 FSAT and has been since the inception of the program in 1992 and has the only known operable manufacturing capability for producing QF-4 FSATs using Air Force airframes.  The production of the FSATs requires a substantial initial investment as well as an extended period of preparation and sustainment.  The QF-4 program utilizes multiple pieces of equipment, such as basic F-4 support equipment and drone unique production support equipment/test equipment, for which there is only a single set.  This unique equipment is currently being utilized by BAE, and will be required for use until all Lot 9 deliveries are completed currently projected for July 2005.   There is no known additional set available to be able to establish a second production facility anywhere.  The government has determined that the only way to minimize adverse impact to critical mission activities requiring continuous availability of full-scale aerial target is to award the follow-on QF-4 contract to the incumbent contractor.  For these reasons, BAE is the only contractor capable of supplying QF-4 FSATs within the required timeframe to meet critical mission requirements.  This acquisition is currently projected to extend into the 2010 timeframe.  The QF-4 program entails modification of government-provided F-4E and RF-4C aircraft with a contractor-furnished equipment/installation package to provide a remotely controlled, supersonic, afterburning QF-4 FSAT capable of all-attitude, high G maneuvering flight, compatible with the Gulf Range Drone Control System (GRDCS) at Tyndall and Eglin AFBs FL and the Drone Formation Control System (DFCS) at the White Sands Missile Range NM.  Major contractor-furnished items are: (1) Command Telemetry System (CTS), (2) Primary and Back-up Automatic Flight Control Systems (AFCSs), (3) Flight Termination System (FTS), and (4) Vector Scorer System [Currently, the Vector Doppler Scorer (VDOPS) produced by Cartwright Electronics, Inc.]. Establishment/maintenance of a body of engineering expertise/sustaining engineering capability will be an integral contract requirement in order to facilitate implementation of candidate system changes/enhancements as requested by the operational community.  Integration of new/additional elements such as newly developed target control system [currently the Multi-Service Target Control System (MSTCS) being developed by the 46th Test Wing, Eglin AFB FL] and service-unique payloads interfaces will be required.  Sustaining engineering support requirement is projected to extend into the 2011 timeframe.  Prior contracts have been issued for EMD and production lots 1-9.  This procurement is a continuation of the production of FSATs and is expected to include annual lot buys for production lots ten (10) through fourteen (14).  Each lot option will include the following provisions: (1) Procurement of a variable quantity ranging from 12 to 36 FSATs with a best estimated quantity of 18 targets per lot, (2) Maintenance/repair of government-furnished F-4 aircraft for the period from receipt for modification at the contractor's facility through FSAT delivery to and acceptance at Tyndall AFB FL, (3) Sustaining engineering for support of the currently deployed FSAT systems (to include configuration management, development of design changes, integration, and documentation (engineering and technical order data) of newly defined requirements), (4) Drone-unique component warranty (option -- two (2)-year or life-time / five (5)-year period of performance), (5) Repair of non-warranted (out-of-warranty) FSAT system equipment, (6) Sustained logistics/ drone-unique technical order/manual (issued as supplemental manuals to basic F-4 manual series) support, (7) On-site technical representative at Tyndall AFB FL, and (8) Spares provisioning.  Environmental stress screening (ESS) from the lowest assembly through the system-level will be required on all drone-unique system components.  All drone-unique components procured from other than currently qualified component vendor(s) and any newly redesigned components due to parts obsolescence considerations will be subject to a formal qualification program requirement.  All FTS explosive components will be subject to lot acceptance testing.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) demonstrating their ability to: (1) Produce QF-4 FSATs including their ability to obtain necessary support equipment to support operational production capability in the 2004 timeframe, (2) Act as a FSAT prime contractor (to include technical capabilities, approaches to problem solutions, current technical expertise, and current or past FSAT development and/or production efforts), (3) Develop and integrate command and control systems used in unmanned air vehicle operations (to include ability to integrate complex electronics, antenna subsystems, and FTS and explosive components, capabilities and experience with software integration/management for RF and command-control systems/ subsystems), and (4) Develop, test, and validate/verify hardware/software for target command and control systems/subsystems.  The statement of capability should show that the respondent has production capability in place to meet the requirements of the QF-4 FSAT follow-on production/sustainment program.  As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort.

Contract award is planned for February 2004 with a 24-month core contract performance period for each lot buy (first delivery 12 months after award/option exercise, last delivery 24 months after award/option exercise date).

<DESC>17. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, DC, anticipates awarding a one year sole source, fixed-price contract to Raytheon Electronic Systems, Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), Keyport, WA for the procurement of the second Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) purchases of MK 54 lightweight torpedoes. The MK 54 torpedo is a modular upgrade to the U.S. Navy lightweight torpedo inventory, combining existing MK 46 Mod 5A(S) hardware with subsystems of the MK 50 and MK 48 ADCAP torpedoes, and commercial off-the-shelf processor components. Also contemplated in this procurement will be the purchase of associated spares, proofing support and material, turnaround kits, data, redesign efforts and engineering services. This entire procurement will provide the U.S. Navy with additional air and surface deliverable torpedoes and support services to combat existing submarine threa ts. It is anticipated that this solicitation, in concert with the current funding stream and government estimate, will allow U.S. Navy to procure torpedo quantity ranging from approximately 12 to 30 units, along with associated services, to meet their testing and IOC requirements. This level of procured units and their accelerated production schedule are necessary to satisfy expedited test firing requirements and normal projected in-water losses to support completion of the initial test program. As the co-designer and developer of the MK 54 Torpedo from Engineering and Manufacturing Development (E&MD) through LRIP Phase I, Raytheon (Keyport) is the only source with the design familiarity, proven vendor base, demonstrated production processes and existing facilities and tooling required to meet the Navys urgent MK 54 test plan requirements. In addition, current manufacturing of  MK 54 torpedoes is a joint effort between the experienced torpedo contractor (Raytheon), the U.S. Navy depot (NUWC, Keyport) and the U.S. Navy design agent and operational software developer (NUWC, Newport). This joint manufacturing process continues to maintain unique skills and processes that are tailored to the existing low rate, highly complex torpedo production process. Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon Electronic Systems, Integrated Defense Systems directly. The subcontracts point of contact is Mr. Tony Forrest and can be reached at 360-394-3411 or by e-mail at Tony_E_Forrest@raytheon.com.*****

The DMCS electronics are mounted within a sealed transit case equipped with an Environmental Control Unit (ECU).  The ECU must be detachable for shipping purposes.  All communications to and from the antenna electronics case(AEC) enter via a recessed panel in the case lid.  Under normal conditions, the case will remain sealed.  The fiber optics interface between the AEC and baseband system is part of the DMCS system.  The DMCS fiber optics interface must be capable of providing communications with a minimum separation distance of 500 feet from the baseband equipment.  The DMCS terminal shall be controlled by a laptop computer within the baseband equipment.  The DMCS terminal must include software for this laptop that provides control of all terminal functions, monitors system performance and provides system alarms via a graphics interface.  The antenna system must also be designed to allow for future upgrade to Ka-Band operation.  The DMCS terminal, when packaged for shipping, must weigh 1200 lbs or less and occupy 115 cubic feet or less.  Weight and volume limits include shipping containers and spares .

<DESC>The purpose of this solicitation is to support the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Resource Program (Biodefense Resource Program, BRP), in achieving its goal of providing unique and quality assured biodefense-related reagents and resources to the scientific community.   This program will provide quality-assured reagents and resources to facilitate the understanding of the pathogenesis of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Category A, B & C Priority Pathogens http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm, emerging infectious disease agents http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/eid.htm, and aid in the development and testing of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics for these organisms.   Long term, it is anticipated that that the BRP will become the Federal governments national resource and clearinghouse for specimens, reagents, and information on these organisms.  By centralizing this function, access to and use of these materials can be governed and quality control of the reagents can be insured. 
      
An important rate-limiting step in basic and translational research is the identification and distribution of state-of-the-art reagents and technology.  To address this need, the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), NIAID is establishing the Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Resource Program.  The BRP will acquire, authenticate, store, and distribute state-of-the-art research and reference reagents, standardized panels, and will provide current information through print and electronic medias to facilitate research and product development for biodefense and emerging infectious diseases.   These materials and information will be distributed to qualified investigators at little or no cost.  Additionally, the BRP will collect information about biodefense-related reagents and standards and will disseminate this information through print, electronic media, and workshops; enhance technology transfer through development and publication of methods; and facilitate commercial development of reagents through proactive communication with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.   Reagent Contributors and users include scientists that meet the registration criteria (Attachment A-1 to the Statement of Work) and are employed by the NIH, Department of Defense (DoD), academic and non-profit institutions, and from industry.

RFP NIH-NIAID-03-34 will be available electronically on or about November 29, 2002 and may be accessed through the NIAID Contracts Management Branch (CMB) Home Page using the following address and instructions:

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-RT-03-00097, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27.  The  associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $5 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  This solicitation is 100 percent set aside for small business.   A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from  the award of this solicitation.  The contractor shall provide EPA with a price on a per sample (replicate) basis  based on the number of samples projected.  This procurement is for the analysis of up to 7800 samples for water column dissolved nutrients (2000 samples), water column total suspended  sediments (7800 samples), sediment grain size (2600 samples), and sediment total organic carbon (2600 samples) in accordance with protocols established by the National Coastal Assessment Program (Heitmuller, 2000). The period of performance will be from 6/01/03 through 5/31/06.  The contractor  shall supply EPA with a cost estimate on a per sample basis for each of the four categories of analysis for analysis of the stated number of samples.  A minimum of one hundred (100) samples in each category will be guaranteed.	The contractor is required to submit a copy  of Quality  Assurance/Quality Control protocols to the EPA contract officer prior to the analysis of the samples.  These protocols shall be the same as, or exceed those described for the National Coastal Assessment Program. The contractor shall agree to allow a QA audit of laboratory and or data entry  procedures by an authorized agent of the EPA at any time during the period of performance.  The contractor is required to transfer copies of all technical, fiscal, and programmatic files regarding this contract to the Project Officer.  These files shall be boxed in accordance with Federal Record  Keeping Standards in boxes required by the Records Center and labeled as "National Coastal Assessment for Nutrients, Suspended Sediments, Sediment Grain Size and Sediment TOC  - Contractor Name / Contract Number" and contain an internal and external packing slip that identifies the specific  contents of each box.  The external packing  slip shall be affixed to the exterior of the box.  To ensure comparable data of acceptable quality, the National Coastal Assessment (NCA) requires that all participating laboratories meet or exceed the following conditions and performance standards for  the analyses of interest, whether conducted in-house or by a contract laboratory.  The methods described here are based on established analytical procedures that are generally accepted and utilized in environmental studies. NCA acknowledges there have been advances in state-of-the-art for some of  the methods; therefore, in keeping with EMAP's performance-based approach to QA/QC, laboratories are encouraged to use their best available technology.  However, prior to approval,  proposed modifications or alternative methods shall first be review by NCA to ensure that the program's quality  standards are met.   Automated colorimetric methods for the determination of  dissolved total N (nitrite+nitrate), nitrite, ammonia, and ortho-phosphate (silicates optional) shall be conducted by using an autoanalyzer (e.g., Technicon AutoAnalyzer, or similar); the use of an autoanalyzer is  required to process samples in an expeditious manner. Nitrate concentration shall be determined indirectly by subtracting nitrite from total N.  Instrument calibration shall be based on a 5-point standard curve for each nutrient analyte; calibration standards should bracket the concentration ranges  of the field samples.  Samples should be analyzed in batches consisting of 10-15 field samples per batch.  Reporting units shall be in mg/L; samples shall be identified to the site by using the NCA site ID code; all samples shall link to a designated batch; final data reports shall be submitted  both electronically (asci delimited) and in hardcopy format.  See Statement of work for quality assurance and quality control standards.  The NCA requires that  sediment grain size be characterized only as percent silt-clay content.  Laboratory processing consist primarily providing a tared filter  to the field crews for processing the sample, once the processed filter is returned to the laboratory - drying the filter, then re-weighing to determine the weigh of residual material (suspended solids).  These methods have practical application for the range of 2 to 20,000 mg/L. Deviations from  the above methods shall be approved by NCA.  See Statement of work for quality assurance and quality control standards.  Total organic carbon shall be determined by combusting pre-acidified samples at high temperature and measuring the volume of carbon dioxide gas produced (Salonen 1979b).  Analytical procedures are generalized. Although the basic method used by various laboratories may be the same, instrumentation differences prohibit giving specific, step-by-step procedures.  See Statement of work for quality  assurance and quality control standards.  Final data reports shall be  submitted in both hardcopy and electronic format; electronic data shall be in ASCII comma-delimited or formatted text.  Analytical results should be expressed as percent TOC; the laboratory shall report using the Coastal 2000 sample ID code; samples should be reported in designated batches along  with the corresponding QA/QC data for each batch.  The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items.  Evaluation criteria to be included (with your quotation) in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2  are as follows: 1.)

GUIDELINES FOR THE PREPARATION
 OF PRODUCT ANALYSIS REPORTS
FOR LIQUID PROPELLANTS

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
Sept 2002

	These instructions are designed for use as a guide in preparing/formatting liquid propellant analysis reports (including gases and cryogenic liquids).  To facilitate scanning or imaging, only computer generated or typed test reports are acceptable, there should be no handwritten entries.   A template of the standardized test report format is provided in Figure 1.  Table I includes the test codes used in this standard report format that will be incorporated into future Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transmissions of test result data.  
 
	Each report should be tailored to include only those rows of information that are applicable to the specific product being tested and the methods used to evaluate each property.  Select only those methods authorized by the product specification unless otherwise stated in the contract.  The code used should be limited to the actual test method used for a particular analysis.   If a test code does not appear for a specification or contract approved method, contact the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) at (210) 925-2488.


DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE STANDARD TEST REPORT FORMAT (FIGURE 1)

Items appearing in italics inside brackets are meant to be short descriptions of the data being requested and should be replaced with the appropriate data.

The test method should be the paragraph cited in the specification for that method or the ASTM procedure cited in the product specification.

Test codes are unique to each test method of each specification or contract clause and must be included on the report.

<DESC>I. Introduction

The Senior HIV/AIDS Specialist and Project Manager (the H/A Specialist) assists USAID Mozambique (the Mission) to carry out responsibilities for planning, implementing, monitoring, and overseeing the Missions activities related to HIV/AIDS awareness, behavior change, care and support, and mitigation.  These responsibilities include regular contact and collaboration with counterparts in Mozambiques National AIDS Council and government ministries and agencies, as well as in a wide range of civil society and private organizations, other donor and international organizations, and other USG entities working in HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and mitigation.  The H/A Specialist is required to exercise extensive judgment in planning and carrying out tasks, in resolving problems and conflicts, and in taking steps necessary to meet deadlines.  The incumbent must possess a high level of technical expertise in the areas of HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and mitigation, and a broad and deep understanding of the social, economic and cultural determinants and implications of the epidemic in southern Africa and in Mozambique.

II. Supervisory Controls

The H/A Specialist is supervised by the Special Projects Coordinator, chief of the Missions Special Projects Unit (SPU).The incumbent is required frequently to interact and coordinate with members of other offices and Strategic Objective (SO) teams to implement successfully the Missions cross-sectoral HIV/AIDS strategy, and particularly with the SO team managing the Missions health programs.  Technical guidance for the position is available from the USAID/Mozambique country strategic plan (CSP); from Mission program and project documentation relating to HIV/AIDS and to activities in other sectors; from USAID/Washington policies, guidance, and resources available online; and from key Government of Mozambique (GRM) documents, including the National Strategic Plan for Combating HIV/AIDS, the poverty reduction strategy (PARPA), and sectoral strategies of the government.  USAIDs Automated Directives System (ADS) and Mission Orders will provide administrative and regulatory guidance related to USAID-funded assistance. 

III. Duties and Responsibilities

As a senior member of the SPU team, the incumbent contributes to the Missions strategic planning process in the development of a new strategic objective for HIV/AIDS that is expected to be part of the Missions 2004-2010 CSP.  The H/A Specialist also is responsible for completing implementation of HIV/AIDS activities under the 1996-2003 CSP, and contributing to the Missions effective transition to new activities under the 2004-2010 CSP.  (20%)

The H/A Specialist leads, or participates as requested in, the design of new activities.  As part of these design responsibilities, the H/A Specialist takes the lead in preparing the full range of documentation related to authorization, negotiation, and implementation of these projects, including implementation letters, MAARDs, and correspondence.  The incumbent also collaborates, as requested, with other SO teams as they design new activities, to ensure that all Mission programs capitalize on any opportunities their programs present for reducing HIV/AIDS impact in Mozambique.  (15%)

The incumbent serves as project manager for the Maputo Corridor AIDS Prevention project, including fulfilling all responsibilities for technical and financial oversight as the Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) for contracts and grants under that project.  In addition, the H/A Specialist is expected to take a lead role in managing the implementation of activities under the Zambezia AIDS Prevention and Mitigation project.  The incumbent is assisted in these project management responsibilities by other SPU staff, and provides guidance and supervision to these staff as necessary to complete project management responsibilities efficiently.  (50%)

The H/A Specialist works with the Special Projects Coordinator, the SPU Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, and other Mission staff to obtain and analyze data and information about HIV/AIDS and its implications for Mozambique, and contributes substantively to the Missions Annual Report.  Successful performance of this responsibility depends upon establishing and maintaining productive collaborative relationships with a wide range of partners and stakeholders, in order to effectively interpret the information needed for performance measurement and results tracking.  (5%)

The incumbent works with other members of the Special Projects Unit to creatively assist all of the Missions SO teams in their efforts to mainstream HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation into ongoing and planned activities in all areas of the Missions program.  In addition, the H/A Specialist advises on and guides the development and implementation of HIV/AIDS-related activities for the benefit of all U.S. Mission staff in Mozambique and their families.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Therefore, a vendor may receive a CGITSS contract that includes all four functional areas, three functional areas, two functional areas, or just one functional area.  CGITSS contracts will promote the use of performance based contracting, however, contracts will also accommodate the issuance of task orders for all types of pricing arrangements (firm-fixed price, time & material, cost-plus fixed fee, labor hours).  CGITSS contracts will allow for various incentive contracting features, including award fee and award term.  This means that the opportunity will exist for CGITSS contracts/task orders to go beyond the normal 5-year performance period, with possible maximum performance periods of up to 15 years.  In addition, CGITSS will require pre-approval of prime contractors teaming partners/subcontractors.  Interested vendors are invited to attend one of two planned Industry Days to be held from 9:00 A.M. till 11:00 A.M. on December 16, 2002 and from 1:30 P.M till 3:30 P.M. on December 17, 2002 at the Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590.  The purpose of the Industry Day sessions is to kick-off the CGITSS MAC project, review the functional areas and labor categories with industry, provide additional information regarding CGITSS, provide a forum for industry to pose questions regarding the project, and obtain from industry lessons learned from their involvement with other MAC and Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs).  If you cannot attend an Industry Day session, you will NOT be precluded from competing for CGITSS contracts, and, you WILL be able to pose questions regarding CGITSS to the contacts identified herein even after Industry Day.   Vendors interested in attending one of the Industry Day sessions must make an advance reservation in response to this announcement.  Due to limited seating, vendors are limited to sending one representative to one Industry Day session.  Reservations must be made by e-mail to Brenda Peterson, bpeterson@comdt.uscg.mil and Dani Wildason, dwildason@comdt.uscg.mil no later than 3:00 P.M. EST on December 6, 2002.

<SOLNBR>NTS-10-2-05927

<CONTACT>Joseph Comella, Contracting Officer , Phone (202) 366-9568, Fax (202) 366-9555, Email jcomella@nhtsa.dot.gov
<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is posting a draft solicitation to the FedBizOpps Internet site (www.fedbizopps.gov ). The draft solicitation includes the statement of work, cost worksheets, evaluation criteria, instructions to offerors and partial contract sections. Written industry comments are solicited and should reference the specific solicitation section in question. Written comments should be sent via e-mail to jcomella@nhtsa.dot.gov no later than October 15, 2002. All comments received by that date will be considered, however, the Government reserves the right to issue the final solicitation, as it deems appropriate. Prospective offerors are cautioned not to rely on the information provided in the draft solicitation as being the same or similar to the information that will ultimately be issued as the formal Request for Proposal.   

This requirement is to support the National Driver Register's data processing and communications needs.  All of the NDR's technical and general support requirements for data processing and telecommunications network management as defined in the draft solicitation must be met.  The Government plans to issue a draft competitive solicitation using the SIC Code 7379 or the NAIC Code 514210 with a SBA Size Standard of $21 million.

The NDR capability is predicated on an IBM OS/390 system (currently version 2 release 10) with ACP/NCP, and RACF (or similar security) providing TSO and supporting IBM's CICS Transaction Server for OS/390 version 1 release 3 (See Section C.2.3.2).  The COBOL for OS/390 compiler is used to compile programs (batch and CICS).  The NDR does not intend to consider any alternative environments and, furthermore, requires support from a vendor who has at least one year's operating experience with TS 1.3 on the proposed system by the proposal due date.  This approach will facilitate the transition from the current timesharing environment to the new one.  

The NDR's current support is based on the use of an IBM 7060-H70 multiprise mainframe with two 100 MIP engines running under the OS/390, version 2 release 10, operating system.  An identical, equivalent, or faster mainframe that supports hardware data compression is required.  The vendor's mainframe must support NDR's estimated peak processing requirements as specified in Section C.3, Table C-2, and it must also be able to support NDR's response time requirements (see Section C.4.4).

This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. The draft solicitation for comments and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a WorldWide Web  (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the FedBizOpps page is www.fedbizopps.gov or  www.eps.gov . It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments  (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

(4)Why would HUD want FEIN? HUD will use the data from the contractor to supplement data from other third party sources.  A comparison of income sources reported by tenants will be made against income sources reported by the third-party sources, which includes the contractor's data. The comparison of FEIN facilitates such comparisons of income sources more reliably than the mere names of the employers. (5)Will multiple contracts be awarded?

HUD expects the exchange of information (request and response) to be transmitted electronically. (14)The solicitation mentions that HUD plans to develop an income verification system (UIV) in the near future, can you provide an estimated time this will be available?  The system is expected to be available to users in March of 2003. (15) The solicitation states that it is okay to transfer the files via the Internet.  Is it okay to send batched data in one of the following formats: An excel spreadsheet or Access database or Word document?  Excel, Access - Yes.  Word - No.  ASCII is preferable.

(19)What type of equipment and or software currently used to verify income?  Public housing agencies across the nation - approximately 4,000 agencies - use a variety of computer and manual systems to verify the income of tenants and applicants for assisted housing.

The contractor must be located within the United States. (21)When are the income verification request and by what agency?

If the data are not available in the contractor's database, then the contractor will indicate so for each tenant for whom a request for information was made. (23)The solicitation indicates that quotes may be received via fax or mail. Is it acceptable for us to ship our quote via priority overnight delivery service such as UPS?  Yes (24)Under STATEMENT OF WORK, it says, "The Contractor shall provide at a minimum..." and then lists the types of data the Contractor will be required to provide to HUD. "At a minimum" appears to imply that HUD would be amenable to receiving more types of data than those listed in the solicitation. Is that correct? No (25)Will HUD be providing a copy of all bidders' questions and HUD's answers to all bidders? Relevant questions received within the 5-day limit are hereby answered within this notice.

No (28)Will the selected vendor be verifying employment information provided by tenants and passed to the vendor or will the selected vendor be required to locate employment information based upon the tenant's name and SSN? The selected vendor will be expected to provide information based on the tenant's social security number and name. Vendors who require other personal identifiers should submit their bids. (29)Will small businesses have an advantage over large businesses?  The requirement will be awarded to the contractor that offers the best value to the Government. (30)What is the proposal evaluation criterion?  Technical capacity, past performance and price (31)The winner may not have a match for every record.  What level of performance is expected from the winning offeror with respect to being able to match records?  The scope of the vendor's database is expected to be national. Vendor's with databases that fall short of being national in scope should state clearly the scope and limitations of the population covered in their databases. (32)Does the 200,000 records required in the RFQ mean HUD is looking for the contractor match 200,000 records per year OR conduct an unlimited number of matches until 200,000 valid hits are received? HUD is expecting the contractor to match an amount not to exceed 200,000 records per year. (33)Are there a set number of records required to be matched each month?  No (34)Is there a minimum number of records the Department will forward to the contractor for matching purposes?  No (35)Will all of HUDs portfolio be matched in the first 12 months? No (36) The Department indicates this RFQ is, "being solicited on an unrestricted basis.  The NAICS code is 561990 and the small business size standard is $6 million.

<DESC>The sources sought synopsis issued on 18 Jun 2002 is cancelled in its entirety and replaced with the following.  The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), 412th Test Wing, Electronic Warfare Directorate, is seeking sources with demonstrated expertise and experience to support Test, Operations and Maintenance (TO&M) for the Air Force Electronic Warfare Evaluation Simulator (AFEWES), a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) Test and Evaluation (T&E) facility located at Air Force Plant No. 4, Fort Worth, Texas.   The Air Force Electronic Warfare Evaluation Simulator (AFEWES) Test, Operations, and Maintenance sources sought synopsis serves as a dialogue between the Government and potential sources and constitutes one form of early industry involvement.  The Government requests industry recommendations, opinions, and feedback.  Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way, or solicit offers from all responsible sources.  The Government will consider all responses to determine the extent of interest of qualified sources in the AFEWES Program.  Industry must submit sufficient information for the Government to determine their capabilities and experience to perform the AFEWES requirements.  The Air Force Flight Test Center anticipates the award of a five-year fixed priced Indefinite Quantity contract that has a three-year base period with one two-year priced option period; however, the Government will consider other contract types.   Anticipated award will be in Q3 FY03 with the performance period to begin 01 Oct 2003.  It is anticipated that the resultant contract will include at a minimum a ninety (90) day phase-in period to afford sufficient time to be able to operate all AFEWES Infrared and Radio Frequency simulators, including, but not limited to, the Jammer Techniques Simulator, Multi-Emitter Generator, AFEWES Clutter Generator, RF and IR high-fidelity threat simulators and other unique, one-of-a-kind AFEWES test equipment.   Since the facility inception in 1958, AFEWES simulations have been developed, operated, maintained, and periodically upgraded at the AF Plant 4 location by Lockheed-Martin Aeronautics Company (or its predecessors) under contract to the United States Air Force.  AFEWES contains high-fidelity, fully-dynamic background (open-loop) and primary player (closed-loop) T&E resources in the Radio Frequency (RF), Millimeter Wave (MMW), and Infrared (IR) spectral regions.  AFEWES simulations represent widely diverse computer and technology levels.  All simulations operate in real-time, at real frequency/wavelength.  The RF/MMW background player simulation is the Multiple Emitter Generator (MEG).  When used autonomously, the MEG provides a dense signal environment for testing passive Electronic Warfare (EW) receivers.  When used in conjunction with the Primary Players, the MEG supports multi-spectral T&E and the evaluation of defensive countermeasures effectiveness in a realistically dense battlefield scenario.  The RF primary player simulations are high-fidelity Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM), simulations that operate between 0.5 and 18.0 GHz.  IR primary player simulations are comprised of multiple red and gray SAM and Air-to-Air Missile (AAM) simulations which include representative hardware, integrated with a flight motion table and target scene projector that operates at correct IR wavelengths.  AFEWES simulations support testing throughout all phases of the electronic warfare acquisition cycle for Department of Defense (DoD), foreign military customers, and contractor EW programs.  Successful TO&M contract performance requires in-depth knowledge, and hands-on staffing to perform daily testing, operating and maintenance functions.  Additionally, technical management of the AFEWES test facility is required.   Firms having an interest, capability and appropriate background are invited to submit particulars of qualification and experience.   Sources must demonstrate the experience and capability to perform preparation, set-up and conduct tests in all areas of the AFEWES laboratory complex.  Sources must demonstrate the knowledge and capability to perform operation and maintenance for the entire AFEWES facility; including unique computer control systems, simulator cable maintenance, flight motion tables, data collection and analysis equipment, secure communications and data transmission hardware and software and internal/external interfaces.  Sources must demonstrate the experience and capability to operate and maintain the existing AFEWES systems without the use of pre-existing operation and maintenance manuals, as they do not currently exist.  Sources demonstrated capability to upgrade existing simulators according to latest information will be evaluated as well as their capability to acquire replacement or spare parts for and repair of simulators and Special Test Equipment (STE).  Critical to this program is the sources knowledge, capability, and demonstrated performance to develop and/or integrate new simulators and STE into the existing AFEWES architecture as this new equipment becomes available from AFEWES upgrade tasks/contracts.  Sources must be capable of integrating Government Furnished Equipment into applicable AFEWES simulators and configuring this equipment for Open Air Range data input, processing, and operations.   Potential sources will be screened for their demonstrated knowledge, experience and capability in the following areas:  operating and maintaining the AFEWES legacy system simulators, as well as conducting multiple, simultaneous tests to include planning, conducting, and reporting functions. Sources possessing the demonstrated experience and capability to perform the requested work are invited to submit a summary of their capabilities and descriptive literature addressing the above technical areas. Responses to this sources sought synopsis should include sufficient information to demonstrate the experience and capability to perform all areas of the required support, as listed above, as part of a qualification package.  The statement of capability should include relevant background and experience, with contract numbers, names and phone numbers of contracting office POC, and names and phone numbers of technical office POC for each contract. Responses to this announcement should be unclassified. Any company proprietary information shall be separately marked. Responses shall be single spaced, single sided and shall be submitted in five copies. There are no page limits to responses. Drawings, diagrams, or figures may be provided as an attachment to the response to clarify stated capabilities.  Because of the nature of EW testing, and the technical characteristics of the simulators, the successful offeror will be required to have as a minimum, a secret clearance, and be qualified to upgrade the clearance to TOP SECRET, immediately upon award.   Sources are advised that the Government intends to use non-Government personnel (Tybrin Corp) to provide technical reviews of statements of capability submitted in response to this synopsis.   Industry is also advised that the solicitation and any resultant contract will be subject to AFMC FAR Sup Clauses 5352.209-9002 Organizational Conflict of Interest (AFMC) (Jul 1997), and 5352.217-9010 Associate Contractor Agreements (AFMC) (Jul 1997).   Sources are advised that any future, actual solicitation issued on the AFEWES Program shall be in accordance with Air Force Material Command FARS Clause 5352.227-9001, (Jul 1997) Qualification of Offeror under Export-Controlled Restricted Solicitation, which states: (This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.

<DESC>The Blood Diseases and Resources Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is conducting a market survey to assess the availability and potential technical capability of small business firms as defined by the Small Business Act.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size is 500 employees which is the conversion of SIC code 8731.  Small businesses are sought to perform as the Administrative Center for the Somatic Cell Therapy Processing project.  The objective of this project is to develop novel cellular therapies that will aid investigators by providing support in areas ranging from basic science through animal studies to proof-of-principle and eventually human trials.  It is anticipated that up to three somatic cell processing facilities will be awarded under separate contracts.  The facilities will implement the rapid, safe, and smooth transition of basic research ideas to clinical practice as well as supply clinical grade products produced in a manner that is compliant with all regulatory requirements.  The Administrative Center will have oversight of the cell processing facilities and will have the following responsibilities:  1) provide management and coordination of the cell processing facilities and assist investigators in developing and preparing protocols and standards of procedures; 2) knowledge of current FDA regulations and assist facilities in developing, obtaining, and maintaining any INDs required for manufactured cellular therapies; 3) implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance procedures for manufacturing processes; 4) participate with facilities to train interested investigators in regulatory procedures; 5) monitor and report adverse events associated with products manufactured in the facilities; 6) assure prompt accumulation, entry, and editing of product-related data in accordance with protocols; 7) initiate and maintain inventories of reagents produced by the facilities; 8) arrange for additional sample testing and/or substudies on products manufactured by the facilities; and 9) analyze study data, participate in the writing of manuscripts and reports, design and maintain a manual of procedures as well as performing other administrative functions pertaining to the project.  Small business firms having demonstrated experience in performing tasks 1-9 above are invited to submit capability statements (original and two copies).  Capability statements must provide evidence of experience in performing the responsibilities described above and demonstrate the following:  1) qualifications and availability of staff needed to perform the work, including expertise in preparing regulatory submissions to the FDA, biostatistics, data collection, data monitoring, data analysis, quality control, quality assurance, and standardization; 2) experience and expertise of both staff and the organization in the operation of an administrative center in coordinating, monitoring and managing all activities required for collaborative development of cell processing protocols including, but not limited to, oversight of facilities operations and communication, assisting facilities in developing regulatory submissions for the FDA, and assisting in archiving samples for repository placement; 3) evidence of prior experience in monitoring multicenter studies related to cell processing or transfusion medicine, both in the collection of data from multiple sites, as well as experience in monitoring quality and timeliness of data; 4) evidence in soliciting cooperation from the facilities and exercising leadership in data acquisition, management, and analysis; 5) facilities and resources necessary for the performance of the requirements listed above; and 6) the firm's status as a small business under NAICS code 541710.  Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP), and responses should not include budgetary information.  The RFP release date is pending.  The government intends to negotiate one contract for the period of five years with an approximate date of award September 30, 2003.  Firms responding to this market survey should provide pertinent information to the requirements mentioned above within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this announcement to the address shown above.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to release a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) entitled "Tuberculosis Curriculum Coordinating Center" to establish a consortium of educational institutions interested in tuberculosis (TB) curriculum development. The objective of the Consortium will be to strengthen, expand, and increase access to the best ongoing educational and training opportunities in tuberculosis for medical and allied health schools in the United States, especially those that provide primary care to under-served
populations.  

The Consortium will have a pyramidical structure with the Tuberculosis Curriculum Coordinating Center (TCCC) at the top level, four or five educational institutions called Curriculum Centers (CCs) at the middle level, and at the bottom level five regional educational institutions working with each CC.  The TCCC will coordinate and participate in all activities of the Consortium for the purpose of defining tuberculosis curriculum deficiencies and needs in United States medical and allied health schools.  The Consortium will be expected to review existing educational materials and to modify and adapt them to the cultural and specific needs of targeted high-risk communities, such as immigrants from countries where tuberculosis is endemic, inner city immigrant and drug user communities, correctional facilities, as well as homeless individuals.  

The TCCC will identify and establish formal working relationships with five educational institutions (CCs).  Each center will be represented by one or more faculty members with expertise in TB.  The CCs will in turn be required to establish and demonstrate working relationships with five regional schools that serve populations in communities that are at high risk of developing TB.   The CCs will be required to demonstrate access to faculty with TB expertise and an academic appointment at a level sufficient to exert influence on curriculum preparation and coordination at each regional school.  The TCCC will be required to work with the CCs in a collaborative effort to: 1) analyze current TB educational materials, eliminate outdated materials, and select materials appropriate for different educational levels; 2) modify and adapt these materials to the cultural and specific needs of targeted communities; 3) obtain Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forms clearance; and 4) develop and test survey instruments to assess student knowledge of TB.  The TCCC will be responsible for preparing agendas for, coordinating, and managing meetings and conference calls of the Consortium.  The
TCCC will also be responsible for the development and maintenance of a website on an open-source server for placement of TB core curriculum.  The web-based curriculum will be the result of a highly collaborative and integrated effort among Consortium participants, utilize state-of-the-art technology for distant learning, and be a primary source for all educational and training
materials generated under this program.  The TCCC will pursue Continuous Medical Education (CME) accreditation for training completed via the website.

In order to accomplish the above tasks the TCCC must demonstrate the ability to 1) coordinate all activities of the Consortium; 2) establish collaborative working relationships with faculty
members to develop and update TB course curriculum and define TB competencies; 3) evaluate existing educational materials; 4) review and critique materials to ensure they are complete and
accurate; and 5) develop, maintain, and enhance a website that contains TB educational materials and provides for distant learning.  The TCCC Principal Investigator must have demonstrated
leadership experience in interaction with faculty members and investigators from multiple sites. The TCCC must have a regular commitment from a physician with expertise in the care and
treatment of patients with TB.

This announcement is a market survey to assess the availability and technical capability of small businesses, as defined by NAICS code 611710 for educational support services, to respond to the
BAA.  The appropriate size standard is 6.0 million dollars per annum. 

Small business firms having demonstrated experience in meeting the requirements described above are invited to submit capability statements in original and 2 copies.  Capability statements
must provide evidence of 1) the availability and professional qualifications of technical staff needed to perform the work, 
2)the experience and expertise in both individuals and the
organization to meet the entire range of activities, 3) evidence of prior experience in developing scientific curriculum, 
4)facilities and resources for the performance of the requirements listed above, and 5) the firm's status as a small business under NAICS code 611710.  Capability statements in response to this sources sought synopsis that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is not a request for contract proposals and responses
should not include budgetary information.  The BAA release date is pending.  The government intends to negotiate one contract for the period of 5 years, with approximate date of award September 30, 2003.  Firms responding to this market survey should provide pertinent information to the requirements mentioned above by December 6, 2002.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR DESIGN BUILD PLUS 03(DBP03)

The Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence, Design and Construction Directorate (AFCEE) is in the process of creating a follow-on acquisition to Design Build Plus (DB+).  This Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract (MAC) for planning, design and construction of Air Force facilities worldwide will be very similar to the DB+ model.   This Request for Information (RFI) seeks industry comment on the DBP03 concept based on the generalized information contained in this document.  This RFI is neither a formal solicitation nor a request for proposals.  This RFI is for informational and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Air Force or AFCEE.

DESCRIPTION

As with Design Build Plus (DB+), the DBP03 acquisition will meld aspects of traditional Design-Bid-Build (D-B-B), those of Design-Build (D-B), Turn-Key (T-K) and those of Architectural/Engineering (A/E) professional services.  AFCEE will employ an A/E firm currently under contract with AFCEE to provide Concept Definition design services.  The purpose of the A/E firm, known as the Concept Definition A/E, is to assist AFCEE in performing its inherently governmental functions.  The Concept Definition A/E may perform pre-design services (planning, siting selection, Requirements Document/Project Management Plan (RD/PMP) development, DD Form 1391 development, environmental surveys, and parametric cost estimates) and concept design of the proposed project (floor plans, preliminary site plans, narratives of proposed facility) infrastructure, and parametric cost estimates as the project develops).  The final product from Concept Definition A/E would be a Request for Proposal (RFP) to complete the design and construct the proposed facility.  The Air Force intends to place considerable importance on this RFP product, as it will establish the quality-based performance criteria and any prescriptive requirements for the project to which the DB+ contractor must provide or adhere.  The Concept Definition A/E or any of its subsidiaries will not be eligible to perform any of the work proposed under the RFP they developed.

SCOPE

It is anticipated what the scope of DBP03 will be $3.5 billion for Full and Open awarded contracts and $400 million for 8(a) Set-Asides set-aside contracts.

FEEDBACK

AFCEE would appreciate your input to the topics mentioned below by December 6, 2002.  Your comments are important to us.  They will assist us in establishing realistic goals and objectives. 

1.  SAMPLE TASK:

Law requires a sample task be used in the selection process to establish the design, construction, and competitive pricing capabilities of each proposer.  Please provide your recommended minimum requirement to successfully prove your design, construction and competitive pricing capabilities. 

2.  BONDING CAPACITY:

AFCEE is anticipating a bonding minimum of $100 million for the Full and Open solicitation and $20 million for the 8(a) set-aside solicitation.  What is your most likely aggregate bonding capacity?

3.  SOURCE SELECTION: 

AFCEE is anticipating the use of one of the following source selection methods.  Each one has different implications on Government manpower requirements during the source selection process.  Please recommend your preferred method.  You may suggest additional alternatives. 

a.  Combined source selection ? Full and Open & 8(a) Set-Asides.  One RFP, one sample task, but two Sections L&M, carried out in one source selection action.  

b.  Serial source selection ? Full & Open and 8(a) Set-Asides.  Two separate solicitations carried out in an integrated series of source selection actions (back-to-back).

c.  Parallel source selection ? Full & Open and 8(a) Set-Asides.  Two separate solicitations carried out in one concurrent source selection action.

4.  8(a) SET-ASIDES

AFCEE is in the process of determining the best method to select 8(a) contractors.  Two methods discussed have been nationwide selection and regional selection.  In both cases, it is AFCEE?s desire to award individual task orders on a nationwide basis.  Please provide a response to the following:

a.  Identify your preferred method of selection?  (Additional methods may be suggested)

b.  Your thoughts on a regional selection and task order award on a nationwide basis?  It is anticipated that a ?decline without penalty? clause would be incorporated into the DBP03 contract.  This would allow an 8(a) contractor to decline work outside their region without penalty.   

c.  Please provide the dollar amount of the largest individual contract you have been awarded as an 8(a), your aggregate bonding capacity, and the 8(a) graduation date.

d.  How do you intend to perform the required 15% self-performance on a nationwide basis?

5.  TEAMING:

It is anticipated that the following teaming arrangements would be offered.

	Joint Venture (full and open)
	Joint Venture, current SBA Mentor Prot?g? participation or ability to participate.  
	8(a) Set-Asides
	General Contractor Lead
	A/E Lead
	Native American
	Alaska Native Corporation

a.  Please provide your preferred teaming arrangement.  You may suggest additional teaming arrangements. 

b.  If you are an 8(a) contractor, have you  entered  into an SBA Mentor-Protege agreement?? 
c.  Have you previously performed as a Mentor-Prot?g? joint venture in the construction arena?

6.  NAICS:

NAICS 236115 - Single Family Housing Construction will be the primary evaluation factor.

Additional projects may include Multi-Family Housing, Commercial and Institutional building construction.

Please provide a synopsis our your company?s capability in performing the construction types describe above.

7.  OTHER CONSTRUCTION:

The statement of work will also include other construction efforts such as dormitories; Homeland Defense related construction and construction related to international hostilities (e.g. hangars, AGE facilities, runways, etc.).

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

A draft Statement of Work is forthcoming.  A notice will be posted on the FedBizOps web site when the Statement of Work is available.  This should occur within a couple of days.  Please provide comments on ways to improve the Statement of Work.

Verification of each calibration will be accomplished with a drug free control, a control at 75% of cutoff concentration, a control at 125% of cutoff concentration and a control at 200% of cutoff concentration.  An acceptable verification will have analytical readings for the drug free < 75% < cutoff < 125% < 200% controls. Open and blind quality control urine will be distributed throughout a test batch and will make up about 10% of the number of total specimens. The reagent must meet the performance criteria outlined in C.3 using this testing protocol.  3.  CHARACTERISTICS OF REAGENTS.  3.1.  PCP.  The reagent shall identify specimens containing PCP. The assay shall identify as positive by the initial test 95% of the specimens that contain 31 ng/mL or more of PCP.  No less than 85% of the presumptive positives shall be confirmed positive by GC/MS at the 25-ng/mL-confirmation cutoff for PCP.  The initial test cutoff concentration is 25 ng/mL of PCP.  3.2.  An assay of 20 sequential aliquots of each of the following samples using the reagent must have a coefficient of variation of the mean concentration value of less than 7.5%: cutoff calibrator, control urine with concentration at 75% of cutoff and control urine with concentration at 125% of cutoff.  The coefficient of variation for calibrators and controls at these concentrations distributed throughout a testing batch must also be less than 10%.  A batch will consist of the samples tested between verifications of calibration.  Throughout the batch there must not be significant drift in control values.  3.3.  The contractor must provide 250 ml of drug free (for amphetamines, LSD, THCCOOH, Benzoylecgonine, Cocaine, Barbiturates, PCP, and Opiates, and must also contain less than 20 ng/mL of benzodiazepines) urine with each reagent kit order (equivalent to 2,000 tests/reagent kit).  The drug free urine provided with the reagent must have a GC/MS drug concentration less than the limit of quantitation for the analyte methodologies.  In addition, immunoassay of the drug free urine should have semi-quantitative concentration readings equivalent to or less than those recorded for drug controls at 20% of the DoD immunoassay cutoff concentrations.  The negative urine should not be sent automatically.  If a laboratory request negative urine, it may be shipped with the monthly reagent delivery and supplied in 1-liter volume containers.  The military laboratories cannot redeem or exchange unused allocations of negative urine accrued by reagent purchase for additional reagents or other supplies from the vendor.  3.4.  A minimum of 95 percent of the open low concentration quality control samples (75 percent of the 25 ng/mL PCP cutoff) must produce negative results in each analytical run and as calculated on a weekly basis.  3.5.  A minimum of 95 percent of the open positive quality control samples (125 percent of the 25 ng/mL PCP cutoff) must be identified as positive in each analytical run and as calculated on a weekly basis.  3.6.  An assay of 20 sequential controls containing drug at 200% of the cutoff concentration must have a coefficient of variation of the mean concentration reading less than 7.5%.  3.7.  PCP.  Each immunological reagent shall be checked for cross?reactivity to drugs, chemicals, or metabolites that might be expected to produce a positive response.  Drugs required to be tested for cross-reactivity include but are not limited to dextromethorphan.  3.8.  The immunological reagent shall be checked for cross-reactivity to each drug/metabolite listed in C.1.2.  With the exception of the cross reactivity between amphetamine and methamphetamine, the reagent must not give a positive assay result for any of the drug/metabolites listed from any of the other six drug classes when they are in concentrations greater than 1 mg/mL or the solubility limit of the drug in urine, whichever is less.  4.
