<CONTACT>RON DONEZ CONTRACTING SPECIALIST 9162789342     ;
<DESC>The US Geological Survey is looking for sources that can provide and install a Baltimore Air Coil cooling tower F1842-LM or equivalent onto an existing engineered structural support at the USGS Western Fisheries Resource Center in Seattle, WA. The statement of work is as follows: USGS - WFRC Cooling Tower Replacement I	GENERAL INFORMATION 	A.	Introduction The Western Fisheries Research Center - Seattle Laboratory is located in Seattle, Washington.  The WFRC carries out research and provide technical assistance to support the best possible stewardship of the Nation's natural resources, emphasizing fish populations and aquatic ecosystems of the West.  The WFRC has a 50 year history of excellence in fisheries disciplines and are leaders in the field of molecular and microbiology within the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  The WFRC addresses the unique issues of large western river systems such as the Columbia, and the challenges faced by desert aquatic systems and their threatened or endangered fish species. The WFRC's Seattle headquarters laboratory is located at Sand Point on the shores of Lake Washington.  The wet laboratory draws large quantities (approximately 500,000 gallon a day) of fresh water from the lake for fish experiments.  Roughly 20% of this water is converted into Hot Process water, and another 20% is converted into Cold Process water. This laboratory, completed in 1994 at a cost of 10 million dollars, replaced a World War II era U.S. Navy building in which the WFRC had conducted fishery research for nearly three decades.  The new laboratory provides WFRC scientists with a world-class resource unique in the USGS, and the research community. The WFRC is a 60,000 square foot laboratory of which approximately 10,000 square feet are dedicated to the wet laboratory which at any given time hosts 20 to 30 long and short term live fish 	B.	Background A cooling tower designed to accommodate the evaporative limits for a 130T chiller has deteriorated to the point of needing to be replaced. This tower is essential for the operation of the 130T chiller that cools the lake water for fish experimentation at WFRC during the winter months. This unit is original equipment that was installed with the new construction of the center. At the time of installation, and prior to 1997, there was no water treatment system in place to protect it from corrosion and scaling. Even with the water treatment that has since been in place, the interior of the tower is at the end of its unusable life. C.	Definitions/ Applicable Documents 	N/A D.	Scope The purpose of this project is the replacement of a deteriorated Baltimore Air Coil cooling tower: Model # - F1842-LM Serial # - 92200569 at the Western Fisheries Research Center - Seattle Laboratory with a new model that is equipped with energy efficient components such as variable speed motor controls. The contractor will provide all equipment and man power necessary to replace the cooling tower. II	WORK REQUIREMENTS 	A.	Technical Requirements The following replacement shall include the following: a.	Project administration and safety b.	Provide new replacement cooling tower (direct replacement for existing) c.	Make any modifications necessary to conform to new cooling tower including reconfiguring piping, insulation, electrical, and control lines d.	Delivery of new tower and offload e.	Install/adapt structural bases, electrical, piping, and controls f.	Deliver equipment to site crane staging area (crane to be supplied by contractor) g.	Detach existing fluid cooler from rooftop platform h.	Modify existing rooftop piping and electrical configuration to accommodate new equipment i.	Remove existing fluid cooler from rooftop, transport to disposal j.	Rig and fit new fluid cooler to mezzanine k.	Re-connect to existing power supply wiring l.	Re-connect to existing control wiring m.	Rough in loop and feed/fill piping n.	Pipe drain/overflow o.	Connect piping to new fluid cooler p.	Fill and test system q.	Test operate new fluid cooler and put into service r.	Provide start-up and commissioning of new equipment s.	Site clean up 	B.	Deliverables 1.	A fully functioning cooling tower installed and accompanied with all supporting owners manuals 2.	Any available and applicable product drawings/literature 3.	The cooling tower shall be turned over to the WFRC fully assembled/installed and ready for use by WFRC personnel  	 III	SUPPORTING INFORMATION A.	Place of Performance 	Western Fisheries Research Center, 6505 NE 65th St, Seattle, WA  98115 	B.	Period of Performance 	45 days from award 	C.	Government Furnished Property 	Existing power, control, water lines (to be modified as needed to accommodate new cooling tower) 	D.	Special Considerations The contractor will be working in the fire lane for the WFRC. Care should be taken to avoid blocking this area for extended periods of time and have the area open to allow egress while not on site. The cooling tower is on the second floor of the mezzanine, located outside adjacent to staff parking. This area's access will be restricted for use by employees at WFRC during all phases of this project. The contractor must comply with all OSHA standards during all phases of the contract.  If you wish to have your firm placed on the source list for the Request for Quotes, which will be issued approximately July 6,2007, please send an e-mail to the Contracting Officer (rdonez@usgs.gov) containing the solicitiation number and the following information for your firm (name, address, phone, fax and point of contact/e-mail address).

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Portland, Oregon, has a requirement for a contractor to prepare a Burned Area Emergency Stabilization Plan and/or Burned Area Rehabilitation Plan for areas serviced by Region 1 of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Tasks within Region 1 may be performed at National Wildlife Refuges (NWR), National Fish Hatcheries and other fishery offices located throughout the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, California, Nevada, Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  Scope of Work:  The Contractor (FSE) will prepare a Burned Area Emergency Stabilization Plan (ES) and/or Burned Area Rehabilitation Plan (BAR) for given areas (refuges, monuments, others) according to provisions contained in Chapter 620 DM 3-Burned Area Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation, Presidential Proclamation 7319 of June 9, 2000, Interagency Burned Area Response Guidebook, current agency directives and plans, and the area Fire Management Plan.  The ES plan will involve 1) gathering, organizing and reviewing existing information on the fire affected area including Incident Management Team actions and recommendations, Resource Advisor reports and concerns, management plans, scientific reports, maps, jurisdictional information, cultural reports, biological reports and data, and other information; 2)  performing general field assessments to become familiar with the area and to initially assess the situation; 3)  evaluating and documenting the impacts of the fire on infrastructure and natural resources; 4)  prioritizing areas for emergency stabilization projects; and 5) developing a draft and final ES plan.  Rehabilitation plans (BAR) will be written as a separate plan, if ordered, independently of an emergency stabilization plan (ES).  The rehabilitation plan will specify non-emergency treatments and activities which meet approved land management plans to be carried out within three years following containment of a wildland fire.  The contractor will furnish all materials required by the BAER Team including transportation, logistical resources, communications (2 way programmable narrowband compatible radios and cell phones), appropriate nomex fire line clothing, leather boots meeting fire line requirements, personal protective equipment, and personal computers.  The contractor is required to have the BAER Team fire qualified with Incident Qualifications Card and equipped to be located on open fire line and on fires that have not been declared controlled or contained.  An Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded for one base and four option years.  The minimum quantity of services to be ordered by task order against this contract is $5,000.00.  The maximum quantity of services to be ordered annually under this contract is $200,000.  This will be a "best value" procurement with award based on technical approach, past performance/organization, personnel qualifications and experience and price. Evaluations factors as a whole are more important than price; however, between proposals that are evaluated as equal, price to the Government will be a major selection factor. Solicitation number: 101817Q475 may be viewed thru a link to the National Business Center Interior Electronic Acquisition System-Electronic Commerce at "http://www.fedbizopps.gov" or "http://www.nbc.gov".

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner for use with US visa programs.  Recently, the Homeland Security Council mandated the capture of all 10 fingerprints of visa applicants for whom US Consular officials receive information that indicates that they may have US law enforcement records.  On June 7, 2005, the Homeland Security Council decided as follows: "It should be the policy of the United States Government that biometric screening of foreign visitors to the United States be based on a fingerprint standard requiring 10-print capture at enrollment and 2-print verification thereafter."<BR><BR>Traditional fingerprint collection methods employing paper cards and ink are slow and inaccurate.  Due to this factor, the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to enhance and expedite the capture process by making it entirely electronic.<BR><BR>Ten prints are needed to check the FBI ten-print fingerprint system Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) in order to ensure that we do not issue visas to criminals who are ineligible for visas.  The transition to ten prints is also necessary for the effective functioning of the IDENT fingerprint system because ten prints cause fewer false positives than two prints.<BR><BR>Consular Affairs is scheduled to complete the conversion of all posts to 10-fingerprint scanning by December 2007. Cross Match L SCAN Guardian scanners are required for this project.  They were selected because they have been extensively tested and used by the FBI and piloted in London, Riyadh, San Salvador, and Islamabad by Consular Affairs.  The Guardian L SCAN is certified for both civil identification flats and full criminal 10-print rolls and flats, and the image quality complies with the FBI EFTS Appendix F.  Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner is found to be the most robust and reliable (in terms of output and data capture and interpretation) units of their kind now available.  Furthermore, the software that CA currently has only works with the Cross Match Guardian Scanners. The addition of ten print fingerprint scanning technology will enable the Bureau to identify applicants with criminal or other US law enforcement records based on biometric data, regardless of the written personal information submitted on their applications.  This will ensure that the Department of State fully complies with Section 303 of The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.  The legislation specifically states that the Department of State must “issue to aliens only machine-readable tamper resistant visas and other travel and entry documents that use biometric identifiers”.   CA requires that any fingerprint scanner must meet the following software compatibility requirements: •	Must utilize an IEEE-1394 PC interface for high speed and efficiency of processing. •	Must be able to read images from an Oracle database. •	Must be able to process the image and store the results into an Oracle database. In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner requested without delay so that the pilot testing required for the verification of field functionality can commence as scheduled.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST requires the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner for use with US visa programs.  Recently, the Homeland Security Council mandated the capture of all 10 fingerprints of visa applicants for whom US Consular officials receive information that indicates that they may have US law enforcement records.  On June 7, 2005, the Homeland Security Council decided as follows: "It should be the policy of the United States Government that biometric screening of foreign visitors to the United States be based on a fingerprint standard requiring 10-print capture at enrollment and 2-print verification thereafter."<BR><BR>

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement to upgrade its Auger PHI 610 scanning system to meet PHI 660 specifications. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the upgrade from RBD Enterprises of Bend, OR, because upgrading the current systems requires a thorough knowledge of the mechnancial, electrical, and software design of the existing system, and the required information is contained within proprietary designs that are only available to that company.  Replacement of the software is not an option, as NASA/GRC would then not be able to compare new data with previously acquired data.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified Technical Point of Contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Monday, July 2, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source purchase order to lease a Pulsed Doppler Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) for Operational Evaluation for four months at Las Vegas (LAS) McCarran International Airport. Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System Policy 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.   This specific requirement is to support the Office of Terminal Weather's mission to perform an operational evaluation and test of the performance of LIDAR at (LAS) McCarran International Airport.  The need for this requirement is to improve wind shear detection at LAS.  The Terminal Doppler Weather Radar does not provide good dry microburst detection, and the test and evaluation will determine if the LIDAR is the solution to complement the TDWR at airports in dry climate locations.  Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies' Wind Tracer is the LIDAR consisting of environmental equipment shelter, transceiver and electronics, scanner, signal processing system, air conditioner/heater, UPS Backup, system control and monitoring. The lease also will include site survey, logistics, planning, and installation, two graphic situational displays and full service maintenance. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement because of the time constraints associated with the completion of this effort. It is in the best interest of the FAA to procure a four month lease agreement as a single source to Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies in order to meet the time constraints of the operational evaluation and test.  If your firm believes it can fulfill the requirement, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Loni Chinn, Contracting Officer by 10:00 A.M. EST, July 6, 2007.

Destination to the National Logistics Support Center in Kansas City, Missouri commencing in November 2007.  NOAA intends to negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with Lockheed Martin Sippican, Inc. (Sippican), located in Marion, Massachusetts.  Sippican is the sole manufacturer of the Loran-C Mark II Microsonde and is the only known source that can provide the required supplies.  This particular model of Loran-C radiosonde is required, because it is the only known Loran-C radiosonde which is compatible with the existing W-9000 ground equipment at the three upper air sites where the radiosondes will be flown.  Changing the ground equipment at the present time is not practicable.  Although NOAA expects that only Sippican can provide the required supplies, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Solicitation DG133W-07-RP-0144 will be issued on or about July 10, 2007 and will close on or about August 9, 2007.  See Notes 12, 22, and 26.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has a requirement to establish, maintain, and operate a program for timely response to reports of marine mammals (both alive and dead) entangled in active and derelict commercial fishing gear.  This requirement includes the responsibility to conduct training to aid in the empowerment and enhancement of the skillset of network members in order to enable them to conduct their own responses, whenever possible, as well as public dissemination of information, approved by NMFS, gained from the response efforts.   The goals of NMFS are to maintain a team of experts to respond to marine mammal entanglements, prevent entanglements from becoming fatal, and to increase the pool of individuals qualified to assist the primary team or, eventually,  to assume full capability and responsibility of the response efforts.  The accomplishment of these goals requires a sound reporting and monitoring protocol as well as the necessary equipment needed for an emergency response team to maximize the potential for decreased timing responses to each incident.  The proposed contract is necessary to maintain a formal disentanglement network as a part of a greater management scheme that involves the U.S. Coast Guard, NMFS east coast regions, several state fisheries agencies, individual fishermen, and conservation and research groups.  The disentanglement program will require dedicated staff along with the infrastructure and administrative resources to support them.  The necessary support shall include office staffing, communications, public/media relations, education and outreach, provision and maintenance of equipment kits and caches, and training of network participants, including small boat safety and handling as required by NOAA small boat program.  The disentanglement network established by NMFS through it's current contractor includes providing assistance in Canadian territorial waters, as requested by NMFS, to the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans for entanglement response.  This proposed contract shall require that these contacts along the Atlantic coast of the United States be maintained.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541620.  The small business size standard is $6.5M. To be eligible for award, offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.gov and obtain a DUNS number by calling 1-800-333-0505.  Proof of CCR registration must be included in submitted proposal package.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. A copy of the solicitation will be attached to this announcement as a downloadable Word file on or about July 9, 2007.  A hard copy of the solicitation will only be provided in response to a written or faxed request received directly from the requestor.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  Requests for hard copies of the solicitation may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Offers received by August 6, 2007 will be considered for award.  Award will be made on or about August 28, 2007.

<DESC>The Contractor shall develop a Education Clearinghouse to provide easy, one-stop access to information and resources that will assist the field in improving the teaching of American history.  The primary audience for the Clearinghouse is teachers.  Secondary audiences are those responsible for K-12 history curriculum or professional development for teachers, including: administrators, curriculum specialists, university faculty in history and history education, and State associations, as well as the general public.  The clearinghouse will also include information on historic preservation as it relates to history education.

This Clearinghouse will be a comprehensive center for history education.  The Clearinghouse will serve as central point for providing public access to a wide range of resources to improve teachers' ability to teach American history in a more engaging and effective manner.  Many history and education organizations currently provide the history field with good information in areas such as academic research, lesson planning, and information on professional development opportunities such as professional conferences.  However, ED recognizes the need to create a center at the National level to synthesize and disseminate the information that these organizations make available.  Also, as part of ED's efforts to fill a national leadership role in history education, ED expects the Clearinghouse to become a source of original work products such as newsletters, policy briefs, issue briefs, and research briefs.

The internet will serve as a primary vehicle through which Clearinghouse staff will provide access to history education resources.  The Clearinghouse web site will provide users with an easy-to-understand and navigate portal that allows simple access and search capabilities for information directly posted on the site and also links to relevant resources on other Web sites.  Content on the site shall be presented in a way that captures teachers' attention and encourages them to make return visits to the site.  New information and features shall be added frequently to maintain interest.  The contractor shall also provide hard copies of items and mail them to teachers without Internet access.

The anticipated RFP issue date is July 13, 2007 and the close date is August 13, 2007.

<DESC>The Joint Force Command Headquarters Brunssum (JFC Brunssum) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the provision of Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL) to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) located at the Kabul Area of Operation (AO) in Afghanistan.  

JFC Brunssum is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. The Host Nation will add to its bidders list of pre-selected firms those U.S. companies that are nominated by the Department of Commerce. Please see the Bidding Procedure section for more information.
 
The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. A draft Statement of Work (SOW) will be the basis of a bidders conference to be attended by any interested contractors. 

All correspondence with the U.S. Department of Commerce relating to this project should use the reference IFIB-ISAF-POL-2007.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The primary requirement of this service is to meet the specific POL needs of the ISAF located in the Kabul Area of Operation (AO), predominantly for delivery to Kabul Airfield (KAIA). To allow operational flexibility in case of supply or transport difficulties between the AO the sources of supply, ISAF requires multiple suppliers, multiple transporters, and multiple routes of transit into the country. POL storage at KAIA will be a NATO-owned facility. A secondary requirement will be the provision of fuel to other locations in the Regional Command (RC), not limited to the Kabul AO, on a case-by-case basis.

The contractor will maintain ownership/title of all bulk fuel throughout the supply, delivery, and storage process. 

BIDDING PROCEDURE

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

As provided for under MBC rules, nominations to the bidders list will continue to be accepted by the Host Nation after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Deadline for requesting Declaration of Eligibility: 3 July 2007

2. Estimated RFP release date: TBD

3. Estimated bid closing date: TBD

<DESC>The Navy has a continuing need for a BMPCOE.  The BMPCOE collects and validates best practices and makes them readily available throughout the nation. BMP provides a solution to quality, cost, and reliability problems by getting contractors to share how they solve problems. The BMP credo of sharing knowledge, insight, and experience has created a unique data gathering, validation, dissemination, and application initiative. A key BMP Program objective is based on companies voluntarily sharing information and is executed through an on-site survey process. BMP provides a professional validation of best practices as surveyed by teams of experts. Surveys are purely voluntary and are done at the request of participating companies/agencies. The survey teams identify best practices in the areas of design, test, production, facilities, logistics, and management. They also review industry-wide problems, investigate alternatives, and document results. The information gathered is disseminated through publications, workshops, and an easily accessible computer database.
BMPCOE makes the validated best practices easily and readily accessible, and these best practices are a key element of BMP's Program Manager's WorkStation (PMWS). PMWS is a suite of tools available on BMP's network and Web Site at www.bmpcoe.org. In addition to collecting and disseminating results of the survey process, this task will provide for advanced research, test, and, when successful, the fielding of new "expert systems" modules and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for the Program Manager's WorkStation (PMWS). Sponsored by BMPCOE, the PMWS is in use, and is made available to program managers throughout all Military Services, other Government Agencies, the U.S. Industrial Base, and academia. The BMP network and PMWS suite are constantly upgrading to improve access and collaborative management within program offices and among users supported by the BMPCOE. The leverage to the Department of Defense (DoD) in general, and the Navy (ONR) in particular, provided by BMP and its PMWS has been without precedent, and the following research and development efforts will further improve the ability of program managers and their staffs, in government, industry, and academia to do more with less.

As a result of the popularity and utility of BMP and its PMWS tool suite, collateral tools, and systems engineering processes, BMP has emerged as a leading support organization to various organizational entities, activities, and/or program offices in all of its areas of expertise (including the various tasks herein). Consequently, BMP performs a substantial amount of yearly Work for Others business. Work for Others business means that these various organizational entities, activities, and/or program offices provide funding to BMPCOE to perform specific tasks.

A site visit day for the GFP is scheduled on 09-JUL-2007 at 10:00 am at the current BMPCOE located at 4321 Hartwick Road, College Park, MD 20740. Additional information can be obtained from Ms. Rebecca Clayton at 703-696-8179.

These installations include but are not limited to: Naval Station Pearl Harbor (includes Pacific Command; Commander, Pacific Fleet; Commander, Navy Region Hawaii; Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet; Fleet Industrial Supply Center, Pearl Harbor; Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Pacific; Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility; Naval Security Group Department, Kunia; Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility; Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command Activity Pacific; Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific and Hawaii; and Navy Exchange); Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai; 15th Air Lift Wing, Hickam AFB; Schofield Barracks; Fort Shafter; and Marine Corps Base Hawaii (includes MCBH Kaneohe Bay; and Camp Smith).  To register for the Industry Forum, please visit the website at:  https://portal.navfac.navy.mil/navfacpac. 

In 2004, the combined military branches in Hawaii controlled 236,303 acres.  On the island of Oahu, the military controls 85,718 acres.  Collectively in calendar year 2006, the military consumed 1,198,800 MWhrs with a consolidated electric bill of $187 Million.
Specifically, the DoD desires to acquire power generated from conventional and alternative fuel sources, and renewable energy sources as defined in Executive Order 13423 ((renewable energy) means energy produced by solar, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean (including tidal, wave, current and thermal), geothermal, municipal solid waste, or new hydroelectric generation capacity achieved from increased efficiency or additions of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric project).  Energy displacement projects, such as solar water heaters that displace heating energy, are not part of this scope, unless innovatively combined with another generating technology.  The current requirement is for all generation to be produced on the military installation.  It is the desire of the DoD that the generation plants will be developed, constructed, owned, operated and maintained by a non-federal government entity or entities.
The desire of the DoD is to purchase power without any direct interest in the ownership or responsibility for the operation or maintenance of the generation assets.  The DoD may consider several procurement authorities and contract formats to accommodate this acquisition; for example, a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), a Public Private Venture (PPV), and/or an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL).  The DoD may consider other alternatives if deemed beneficial to the government.
Specific sites for potential distributed generation plants will be shared at the Industry Forum.
Finally, it is the DoDs intent to purchase power at a rate which is lower than what is currently being purchased for the base. Currently the electricity rate for DoD installations ranges from $0.14/kWh (installations on the island of Oahu) to $0.30/kWh (installations on the island of Kauai).
Specifically, the DoD is currently interested in identifying risks and advantages associated with awarding a contract(s) for the procurement of power, including, but not limited to; awarding a contract within a timeframe where current Federal and State Tax Credits can be applied. Unless extended by Congress, the current deadline for receiving the Federal Renewable Tax Credit is December 2008. Perceived risks are supply of material, construction timelines, Renewable Energy Credit (REC) sales and pricing, and capital financing availability.  Responses to this RFI should address these and other issues that the responder feels should be brought to the attention of the DoD.
The DoD would also like to ascertain whether the sale of power to other parties other than the DoD is either desirable and/or feasible.  In that regard, responses should address specifically what capacity or size of generation asset would be envisioned, and what acreage of land would be developed.  Furthermore, the DoD requests information in regards to an alternate arrangement for a PPA where a site for the distributed generation system would be unspecified. Responses should include considerations of site and location, limitations of site and location, market demand for power, power transmission and distribution costs, and any other pertinent information the responder deems should be brought to the attention of the DoD.  The DoD plans to provide site specific information, including capacity or size of generation asset required and acreage of land available, at the Industry Forum.
The DoD requests that interested parties submit a Statement of Interest and as a minimum provide the following information: (1) Name and location of company, type of business; (2) capability and relevant experience; (3) financial capacity to develop, construct, own, operate and maintain a distributed generation system of desired magnitude; and (4) points of contact.  It is the Governments intent with this RFI to receive Industrys Input as stated in the Statement of Interest Questionnaire.  Marketing brochures or elaborate descriptions of the company are neither necessary nor desired.
The Forum concept is to focus on the acquisition of Distributed Generation for DoD installations in the State of Hawaii.  The intent of the Forum is to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regards to soliciting proposals for Distributed Generation (DG) for various military installations in the State of Hawaii.
All information submitted will be considered proprietary and for official government use only.  Interested parties are encouraged to mark their submissions accordingly.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL (RFP), AND A CONTRACT AWARD WILL NOT BE MADE FROM THE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF INTEREST. The Statement of Interest is due thirty (30) days after this posting date. The maximum length of the Statement of Interest is seven (7) pages. POC: MARK ASATO (808) 471-5691 OR EMAIL: DoDHiGen@navy.mil

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) has a requirement for capabilities and facilities to establish and manage a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) to support NIAID sponsored clinical research programs in allergy/asthma, autoimmune, and transplant-related diseases.   
		   Description 
The Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to recompete a requirement for capabilities and facilities to establish and manage a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) to support NIAID sponsored clinical research programs in allergy/asthma, autoimmune, and transplant-related diseases.   

Under the current contract to the PPD Corporation (HHSN266200400075C), the SDCC has served to provide a broad range of clinical research support services to the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN).  Under this contract, the Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) will support each of the following two research programs: 

The Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) was established in 1999 and is currently under a contract to the University of California, San Francisco.  The overall goal of the ITN is to accelerate the evaluation of promising approaches for the induction and maintenance of immune tolerance in four clinical areas: solid organ transplantation, islet cell transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and asthma and allergic diseases.  

The Asthma and Allergic Diseases Cooperative Research Centers (AADCRCs) were established in 1971 to promote integrated, multidisciplinary basic and clinical research on the immunologic mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of asthma and allergic diseases.  The overall goal of this program is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of asthma and allergic diseases, and to provide a rational foundation for the development of effective therapeutic and prevention strategies.  


The Contractor shall serve as the SDCC for clinical and non-clinical research activities carried out by the ITN with the responsibility for a broad range of support functions, including: statistical design and analysis; clinical data collection, storage, management, quality control, reporting and associated training for clinical site personnel; safety oversight; preparation of study-related materials; and clinical study website development and maintenance.  

In addition, the Contractor shall also support the AADCRCs by providing assistance in the statistical design, analysis and final reporting for some clinical trials and mechanistic studies upon request of the Project Officer.  This will typically involve a multi-center effort and a collaborative relationship with clinical investigators, other supporting contractors, and DAIT/NIAID staff.    

(Note: Although the ITN generates both clinical and mechanistic data from each trial, the scope of SDCC statistical functions is limited only to clinical data as specified in each protocol.  Statistical design and analysis of mechanistic data and combined data from both clinical trials and mechanistic studies will be performed collaboratively by the ITN Clinical Trials Group and the ITN Bioinformatics Group).

The contract will be funded for a base period of six (6) years to provide SDCC support for the research activities of the ITN and the AADCRCs.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to exercise three (3) options: Option 1 provides for an extension of the contract for one (1) additional year to continue the SDCC support services specified in the base period for both research programs; Option 2 provides for additional SDCC support for data collection, storage, management, quality control and reporting for some  AADCRC studies at the request of the Project Officer; and Option 3 provides SDCC support for other DAIT-sponsored research programs and projects involving clinical research on immune-mediated diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, solid organ, tissue and cell transplantation, and autoimmune disorders.  These other programs and projects that may be supported under Option 3 include new individual clinical trial grants and existing and future clinical research programs/networks and projects awarded by DAIT.   It is anticipated that up to one cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded for a period of six years, beginning approximately September 29, 2008, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 25.5 FTEs for the Base period, zero additional FTEs for Option #1, 6 additional FTEs for Option #2, and 3 additional FTEs for Option 3.  The anticipated total effort for the Base period and Options 1, 2, and 3 is approximately 34.5 FTEs.

Construction cost is anticipated to be approximately $100,000 to $250,000 thousand.  The Department of Veterans Affairs is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Every effort will be made to ensure that all persons, regardless of race, religion, sex, color, ethnicity, and national origin have equal access to contracts and other business opportunities with the Department of Veterans Affairs.  PROJECT BACKGROUND &amp; DESCRIPTON The Department of Veterans Affairs, is seeking a qualified executive design professional to perform design and construction phase services for a project to expand two new parking lots on the Veterans Affairs Regional Office campus, to be called Employee (Overflow) Parking Lot. The Employee (Overflow) Parking Lot project will provide 80 to 90 parking places on a currently undeveloped site immediately adjacent to the Main employee parking lot west of the Regional Office.  The project also will improve 54 existing spaces in a gravel lot on an undeveloped site on the west end of campus adjacent to new Employee (Overflow) Parking Lot. Improvements will include lot surfacing or paving, parking stall marking, site drainage, night lighting, paved driveway entries,  landscaping, and signage.  The Veterans Affairs Regional Office is committed to sustainability and requires this project will be designed, at a minimum, to incorporate &quot;core&quot; LEED credits that are applicable to the nature of the project, such as storm water disposition and water-conserving irrigation and landscaping.  SCOPE OF SERVICES The scope of services for Employee (Overflow) Parking Lot  includes civil engineering, electrical engineering (for lighting) and landscape architecture for schematic design and design development, construction documents, bidding, construction administration, record documents, and warranty period services. The lead firm (which will contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs) may be a civil engineer and/or a landscape architect, as long as both disciplines are included in the scope of services. Based on funding availability and Department of Veterans Affairs approvals, and as directed, the design professional will:  1. Prepare schematic design documents.  2. Prepare design development documents.  3. Prepare construction documents, including complete plans and specifications suitable for lump sum, competitive public bidding.  4. Prepare cost estimates at all phases (a sub consultant may be used for this service).  5. Provide construction phase services.  6. Provide record documents created in AutoCAD.  7. Provide warranty period services.  8. Provide additional services as requested by the Regional Office.  SCHEDULE Schematic Design for the Employee (Overflow) Parking Lot is scheduled to begin in October 2007. The exact schedule will be determined in consultation with the selected design professional. The schedule for construction is to be complete by December 31, 2007.  DESIGN FEES  The fee for basic services as described above for the Employee (Overflow) Parking Lot is anticipated to approximately $20,000. These fees include the services of all consultants.  SELECTION CRITERIA The Screening Committee will be seeking a design firm with experience in comparable projects. Applicants should clearly highlight such projects and their similarities to the proposed project. Specific responses will be reviewed more carefully than those stressing breadth of experience or general qualifications. Experience of individuals on comparable projects while with the proposing firm will carry more weight than experience with other employers. Major considerations in the selection of the successful firm will be the following:  o Design and planning excellence and demonstrated firm and staff capability to respond creatively and sensitively to the requirements of this project and the fabric of the existing Veterans Affairs Regional Office campus, with an economy of means.  o Demonstrated firm and staff experience in the design and construction of sustainable landscaped parking lots with alternative (i.e., non-asphalt) surfaces.  o Proven technical, budget, and schedule management capabilities.  o Experience preparing bidding documents suitable for lump sum, competitive public bidding; so experience with design-expand may be a plus, but is not required.  o Qualifications of the principals and project team members, including a clear definition of the primary responsibility of each.  o Proximity to the Regional Office, or ability to provide a comparable level of service if non-local.  o Ability to provide Professional Liability Insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.  SELECTION PROCESS Firms interested in submitting qualifications should notify the Department of Veterans Affairs by printing and returning the registration form to the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office, 9500 Bay Pines Blvd, St. Petersburg, FL 33708. Failure to register with the Department of Veterans Affairs may result in firms not receiving updates to the Request for Statements of Qualification, should any be issued.

Sub consultants, if any are proposed, should NOT submit a registration form; such submittals will not be acknowledged. Written Qualifications Statements should be in accordance with the attached Submittal Format.  The Department of Veterans Affairs will convene a Screening Committee to review submissions and recommend a short list of firms to be interviewed by a Selection Committee. Screening is expected to take approximately one week. The Selection Committee anticipates scheduling all interviews of short listed firms on a particular day it will appoint, approximately one to two weeks after receiving the recommendations of the Screening Committee.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of an HP digital sender.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the HP 9250c Digital Sender as equipment that will enable the government to scale down bulky files by scanning documents and storing them in a digital format.  The Digital Sender 9250c is designed to support network authentication, which will require users to log on before they can use the digital-sending options.  The Digital Sender 9250c can also make use of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to find e-mail addresses on directory servers that are located elsewhere on a network.  The HP Digital Sender 9250c is a net accessible device that users can employ to scan, package, and distribute scanned documents.  It converts black-and-white and color documents, drawings, and photographs into an electronic form for direct distribution to multiple destinations.  It includes a flatbed scanner as well as an automatic document feeder that accepts up to 50 pages. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The HP 9250c Digital Sender has undergone test and assessment, received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board, and has been deployed at several offices of the U.S. Department of State.  The following features are unique to the HP 9250c Digital Sender and best meet the Department’s requirements for a digital sender: •	E-mail can be used to distribute the electronic forms.  The document can be scanned and sent to one or more e-mail recipients in the form of a PDF, JPEG, TIFF, or MTIFF file. •	The 9250C is designed to directly send documents to a LAN fax, Internet fax, or Windows 2000 fax destination •	Network folders or FTP can be used to save electronic forms created by the 9250c Digital Sender with additional information about the document.   •	A printer can also be set up as a workflow destination, allowing scanned documents to be printed<BR><BR>

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Micro-Sensors for Imaging. The objective of this effort is to develop technologies for extremely light weight micro-cameras sensitive in the visible to short wave and in longer wave infrared; and to demonstrate such camera systems in micro-vehicles and head mounted applications.  The proposed research should investigate and exploit innovative approaches that will enable revolutionary advances in science, materials, detectors, focal plane arrays, micro-packaging, optics, electronics and signal processing leading to extremely light weight cameras.  Specifically excluded is research, which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice

The primary goal of this program is to establish the micro-systems technology for extremely light weight, low power cameras with the performance necessary for medium to short range applications.  The components comprising the light weight camera include the optics, packaged detector, electronics and camera housing. Innovations in optical and detecting materials; sensor design and fabrication, signal processing, and micro-packaging are necessary to achieve goals for extremely light weight.  

PROGRAM SCOPE   
 	
This program addresses development of sensor technology critical to micro-vehicle and head-mounted system applications, integration of sensor technology into a package consistent with the application, and demonstration of system prototypes.  Micro-air and micro-ground platforms and helmet mounted applications require:  sensor operation at room temperature or with extremely low power cooling and temperature stabilization, sensor micro-package with operational lifetime consistent with military operations, and optics and electronics consistent with the platform.  The first phase of the program shall demonstrate the feasibility of integrating an imaging array into a micro-package of the size and weight necessary for the application and with performance compatible with system goals.  This will include demonstration of the key attributes of the proposed approach, and paths to evaluate the risk.  The measured data shall be supported by models and calculations predicting performance.  Options may be exercised to continue the program after this initial demonstration.  

The second phase will consist of an integrated system feasibility demonstration for the proposed application.

<DESC>This notice is to update all interested parties on the CFT acquisition process.  We have finished obtaining permission from all required levels at Tinker.  The entire package will now be forwarded to AFMC and the Pentagon (SAF/AQ)  for final review and approval.  No major questions or objections were raised here at Tinker during the review, and none are anticipated from the Pentagon.  The review authorities at the Pentagon are aware of the urgency of the situation and are expecting the package.  While we anticipate review to occur swiftly, this can be a relative term.  An estimated release date for the formal RFP is not available, as it simply cannot be predicted.  A best guess is sometime in July  2007.  The next posting will  hopefully be to let everyone know a more exact date.  Thank you for interest and continued patience.

<DESC>Sources Sought


This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. Qualified sources are limited to 8(a), Hubzone, and small businesses including service disabled veteran owned small businesses, veteran owned small businesses and women owned small businesses. Those parties that have an interest and ability to provide FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) with the services detailed below should SUBMIT CAPABILITY STATEMENTS. The capability statement and supporting data that clearly illustrate/exhibit the contractor's ability to perform the specified requirement, such as previous similar services performed or resumes, must be submitted no later than February 7, 2007. An electronic copy and four hard copies of the capability statement and each supporting document shall be sent to the contact listed in this announcement. This IS NOT a request for proposals. This synopsis seeks to identify the interest from prospective contractors to assist FDA in the ongoing research, development, and implementation of CDRH's Medical Product Safety Network (MedSun).  

Project Description:     

MedSun is a CDRH adverse event reporting/feedback pilot program that has been funded since 2002 under a Task Order contract.  That contract expires in August 2007.  The MedSun program currently includes 350 hospitals and nursing homes which report on-line to CDRH about problems with the use of medical devices.  The program involves investigation of those problems, creating solutions to those issues, and providing feedback to the clinical community about the problems and the solutions.  Educational tools are developed to teach clinicians how to recognize device problems, how to write quality reports about those problems, and how to improve the safe and effective use of devices.  This development is a creative, ongoing process.  The program requires specific, advanced technical capabilities and knowledge.  The technical capabilities include: understanding and experience with sociological research, understanding and experience of surveys and sampling methodologies, experience with a wide array of large health data bases and national health care organizations, techniques for quality assurance, understanding of trend analysis, sound judgment about data quality and usefulness, and development of outcome measures. Technical capabilities also include a wide array of research techniques for special studies to understand the use of medical devices in the clinical community, the ability to present technical materials in written and graphical form to non-technical audiences, and a staff of nurses, physicians, and engineers highly knowledgeable of the use of medical devices in all areas of hospitals. In addition to these technical capabilities, a detailed understanding of federal and state policies related to collection of health care data and medical device adverse events is critical, as well as a detailed understanding of the medical device related statutes of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and the associated medical device regulations. 

Because the MedSun program is an ongoing program, there can be no time lag in transitioning the current program from the current contractor to a new contractor.  Therefore, a prospective candidate must have the in-house capability to be able to assume the full project and provide seamless workflow from the beginning of the new Task Order contract.

Describe in detail your proven capability and current in-house capacity to perform all the following required capabilities, as well as those cited in the Project Description paragraph, above:

Experience in recruiting a representative sample of acute-care hospitals for participation in long-term research efforts. If your firm lacks prior experience with this task, describe specific steps that you would take to to recruit and retain acute care hospitals for participation in long-term research efforts.

Experience in training hospital staff in use of electronic reporting system to report device-related events and providing technical support to more than 1000 system users.

Experience in maintaining on-going cooperation from health-care provider organizations in a national, large-scale patient safety reporting effort.

Demonstrated ability to maintain high level of data security handling sensitive data collected from health provider organizations; credibility with hospital community regarding collection and handling of organizationally sensitive data.

Capability to provide programming and systems support to FDA in maintaining and performing enhancements on secure on-line patient safety reporting system.

Demonstrated ability to obtain project participation of nationally-known patient safety experts in an advisory capacity.

Demonstrated ability to produce useful multi-media educational tools designed to teach clinicians to recognize and report problems with medical devices.

Project management staff with knowledge of medical technology and experience in managing a clinically trained staff.

On-board staff, or plans to bring staff on board, with clinical training and hospital-based experience in biomedical engineering and nursing in device-intensive settings with experience in root-cause analysis.

On-board staff, or plans to bring staff on board, with experience in developing device problem codes, and in coding adverse event reports with patient and device problem codes.

Experience in conducting web-based rapid response organizational surveys.

Experience in subcontracting to major medical institutions to conduct research.

Experience in planning, organizing and conducting conferences for 300 to 400 hospital-based staff involved with device safety (such as risk managers and biomedical engineers).

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to make a single award for professional services to support the MedSun program.   MedSun is a medical device adverse event reporting network. It is comprised of a primary network and several sub-networks. The primary network collects information on radiological devices generally, while the sub-networks collect information about specific classes of devices. The program involves investigation of the adverse events reported and providing feedback to the clinical community about the events and possible remedies thereto.  Currently 350 hospitals participate in the MedSun program, providing reports to both the primary network and sub-networks.

The purpose of the intended contract is twofold: to obtain assistance in the continued development of the program, and to process incoming reports and to analyze the data. 

With respect to program development, the contractor shall recruit and train participating sites, develop incentives plans to retain participating sites, and increase participation in sub-networks.  The contractor shall also maintain and market the MedSun websites, and administer, update and test the MedSun database.  The development of communication plans, small scale compliance evaluations, and rapid response surveys is also required. Additionally, the contractor shall advise the FDA on program related issues.

With respect to the processing of reports and data analysis, the contractor shall process incoming reports.  Processing the reports is not solely a clerical function, but requires the expertise to understand the reported events from a clinical and biomedical perspective.  The contractor shall also code the reports, analyze the reports, meet with the FDA to review reports, and perform follow-up to the reports as requested.  Additionally, the contractor shall assist the FDA in evaluating the impact of the MedSun program and shall develop methods to link data received to the demographics of the participating hospitals.

The contract is expected to consist of a one year base period, with four one year option periods.  The deliverables called for under the contract shall be provided according to the schedule set forth therein.  Some contractor employees will be required to work on-site at the FDA? facility located at 1350 Piccard Dr Rockville, MD 20850 ? others may work off-site.  It is anticipated that a written solicitation will be released on or about June 4, 2007.  Award will be made on or before September 21, 2007.  

All responsible sources may submit an offer, and the FDA will consider all offers submitted. All contractors doing business with the Federal Government must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  The website for registration is www.ccr.gov.

Offer due date and time for receipt of proposals will be set at the time the full solicitation is posted, but not less than 30 calendar days from such time.  The solicitation cited above can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).

At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company's , CCR Point of Contact )your Company's DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number),Your Telephone Number, Your E-Mail Address. 

Also, Beginning January 1, 2005, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) all vendors will be required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. 


ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.   Potential offerors should refer to the solicitation package regarding instructions involving the use of ORCA.  

Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities website for amendments, if any, to the solicitation.  All requests must be submitted to:

<DESC>This amendment provides questions and answers and revised the points of contacts for the subject RFP.  The following questions and answers are provided: 1. Regarding the vacuum system: this system is not described as a standard feature by the "preferred vendor" and we need more information; please describe exactly what is required.  Specifically,  a.    What vacuum level is required in the streak camera when it is being re-connected to the experiment.  Answer: The experiments will not be conducted in vacuum.  The vacuum required is for the x-ray system when not connected to an external vacuum system. b.     What is the desired flange configuration? Answer:  Since it is not expected for this system to be attached to a vacuum system the flange configuration is not a concern. Please supply a complete description of othe vacuum requirements.  Answer:  Not required as the vacuum system is for the operation of the streak system and not dependent on the experiments. 2. Regarding the streak plug-in requirements: Optronis streak cameras are designed for optimal performance at all streak speeds.  For example, the jitter of an Optronis streak camera is specified at <5 picoseconds as opposed to 20 picoseconds for others.  Is it acceptable to supply 2 plugin sweep units in order to best optimize all ranges, rather than compromising by forcing no plug ins? Answer:  We prefer not to have to swap out sweep units. Responses are still due no later than 3:30 PM EST on 28 June 2007.  Responses may be provided electronically or via US mail.  Electronically sent to renee.m.brown@navy.mil or georgia.warder@navy.mil.  US Mail:  4072 North Jackson Street Suite 132 Bldg. 1558, NSWC Indian Head, MD  20640-5035 ATTN:  C13 or C13A.

The due date for responses to this announcment has been extended to August 3, 2007. Please note: any questions received to date, and any that may be forthcoming, will be answered at a future date prior to the REVISED due date of August 3, 2007. Also, please note that this announcement is not an RFP, all requirements for responding to this announcement are contained within the announcment below. 



NREL On-Site Photovoltaic (PV) Project

Opportunity Announcement

June 6, 2007

Summary:

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) located in Golden, Colorado and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office (GO) are seeking opportunities to collaborate with a solar energy project developer for the purpose of developing an on-site solar electricity generation project at NREL. Development of this project is encouraged by a utility incentive program that was implemented in Colorado for purposes of compliance with Colorado's Renewable Energy Standard (RES). The Colorado Legislature recently increased the RES to require higher percentages of solar electricity generation by qualifying retail utilities. Though not subject to the RES, DOE and NREL are customers of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Xcel), a major U.S. investor-owned electric and natural gas utility with regulated operations in Colorado that is subject to compliance with the RES. Prospective developers responding to this Opportunity Announcement must be willing to prepare and submit a proposal to Xcel Energy's Solar*Rewards Program as a third-party developer for a customer-sited photovoltaic (PV) system at NREL. 

Project Structure:

DOE and NREL expect the developer to be capable of designing, financing and installing a ground-mounted PV system that can produce a minimum of 1,200 MWH per year. The system will be located on Federal government property at NREL's South Table Mountain (STM) site in Golden, Colorado. Approximately five acres of land will be available for the project. In addition, DOE and NREL expect the developer to own, operate and maintain the PV system for at least twenty years. In addition to the ground-mounted system, other opportunities may exist to develop roof-mounted PV projects on existing DOE-owned buildings at NREL, as well as on buildings currently in the design phase for which construction has not yet begun. 

Based on prior Xcel Request for Proposals (RFP), DOE and NREL anticipate that the financial structure for the project will include the following elements: (1) a 20-year power purchase agreement for DOE to purchase the entire electricity output of the PV system; (2) a one-time rebate payment from Xcel to the developer in the amount of $2.00 per watt for up to a maximum of 100 kW per system, payable upon confirmation of the Commercial Operation Date; (3) monthly payments from Xcel to the developer for all Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SO-RECs) generated for a 20-year period; and (4) any Federal or state tax credits for which the developer may be eligible. 

 
Prospective developers must be willing to enter into specific agreements with various parties which may be involved in the successful execution of this project. These agreements include the following: (1) a no-cost easement with DOE for access to the land; (2) a power purchase agreement with the Western Area Power Administration (Western) for the electricity generated by the ground-mounted PV system; (3) a site use agreement with the NREL Division of the Midwest Research Institute for installation, operation and maintenance activities conducted at the site; (4) a third-party rebate contract with Xcel; and (5) a third-party SO-REC contract with Xcel for all SO-RECs generated.

Project Selection and Timing:

While no announcement has yet occurred for 2007, DOE and NREL expect Xcel to issue another RFP for customer-sited PV generating facilities above 100 kW and up to 2 MW DC under Xcel's Solar*Rewards Program. Typically, Xcel provides very short response times for proposal preparation after an RFP is released. In order to allow more time for developers to prepare a proposal for submission to Xcel, DOE and NREL intend to identify solar project developers prior to Xcel's release of an RFP. Because of the financial incentives offered through Xcel's Solar*Rewards Program, future execution of this project depends on the developer's proposal being selected by Xcel under an upcoming RFP.

Based on responses to this Opportunity Announcement, DOE and NREL intend to select two or three solar project developers. The selected developers will be given more detailed site information and a site tour for their use in preparing a more detailed proposal for submission to Xcel. DOE has begun an environmental assessment (EA) for this project pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The EA will be completed by DOE at no cost to the developer. DOE and NREL will allow the developers flexibility to decide the level of effort they wish to put into proposal preparation prior to issuance of an RFP by Xcel. All proposal preparation and development costs are to be borne by the developer. At such time as Xcel issues an RFP, DOE and NREL will ask the developers to submit their final proposals to DOE and NREL for review. Based on this review, DOE and NREL will cooperate to select one developer who will then submit its proposal to Xcel. All selection decisions will be final and are within the sole discretion of DOE and NREL. 

Based on past experience, DOE and NREL expect that Xcel's process will be highly competitive and their selection criteria will be based largely on SO-REC price. Prospective developers are encouraged to create a financial structure for the project aimed at minimizing the SO-REC price and the price of electricity generated.

 
Response Requirements:

Response length is limited to two, double-sided pages, 8.5 in. x 11 in., with no smaller than 12 point font and 1 inch margins. 

Responses shall include the following information:

Past Experience. DOE and NREL will consider past experience in financing, designing, installing, owning, operating, and maintaining PV systems of similar size and complexity. The developer must have experience with a minimum of one installed and operating PV system of at least 500 kW. If the developer forms a joint venture or other teaming arrangement, these same considerations will be applied to the parties to the joint venture or teaming arrangement cumulatively.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Columbia Environmental Research Center, has a requirement to obtain an independent peer review upon a focused scientific review that shall either validate the efforts to date, or set in motion needed improvements that can be incorporated into future studies under this program.   The peer review shall convene a panel of experts that can address, as science peers the following lines of research with the shovelnose sturgeon and pallid sturgeon; fish ecology-behavior, fish physiology-especially reproductive, hydrology/geomorphology-relation between fish and physical habitat in a managed system, and GIS/data management-tools for understanding fish movement, habitat selection in a large system.  The peer review shall include presentations and literature research plus a final report addressing stated objectives. The U.S. Geological Survey considers this specified requirement as a sole source to Sustainable Ecosystems Institute (SEI) of Portland, Oregon.  This contractor has demonstrated the ability to provide this type of independent science review within the time frame required.  More importantly, while under contract with the Corps, SEI has reviewed other portions of the Missouri River Recovery Program which are closely linked to the CERC Comprehensive Sturgeon Research Program.  This critical experience enables the review to take place within the context of all management actions that include research and monitoring, habitat improvements and propagation.  SEI has a familiarity with the science and information gaps on pallid sturgeon restoration, and has a working familiarity with experts that are knowledgeable in the disciplines and subject matter necessary for the science review being sought.   Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services will submit a capabilities statement to the contracting officer USGS, PO Box 25046 Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO 8025-0046 no later than the closing date of this requirement (06/29/2007) 4:00 PM MST.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist; if no submissions are received by the above appointed time, the Government will proceed with noncompetitive award without further notice.  This is NOT a Request for Quote (RFQ); the Government does not anticipate issuing a written solicitation.  This notice and any resulting contract or order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-04, effective 08 June 2005.  No number notes apply.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) is soliciting proposals in the following area of Advance Guidance and Control - Assessment of Operational and Safety Benefits. The objective of the SIR is to solicit proposals in the following area of flight safety research to conduct research that removes some of the obstacles to the introduction and certification of advanced flight guidance and control (FG&C) systems that are safer and operationally more effective than the current generation of FG&C systems onboard transport aircraft.  The work will implement a previously developed representative advanced functionally-integrated FG&C system called Total Energy Control System (TECS) and Total Heading Control System (THCS) algorithms in a part-task simulation, and perform an in-depth effectiveness and safety evaluation. The research task shall use the simulation and other methods to analyze the TECS/THCS system concept, identify possible certification issues and avenues to resolve them, and develop appropriate system operational, performance and safety requirements and objectives.  The outputs generated from this research will be used by the FAA as input for development of FAA policy and guidance, as well as provide input to later tasks that will subsequently accomplish the overall research plan. The Technical evaluation will be based on three (3) factors: (1) Technical Approach; (2) Relevance to Aviation Safety; and (3) Research Performance Competence. Offerors will be required to submit separate technical and cost proposals for each task bid.  For evaluation purposes, technical is considered more important than cost. Award will be based on Best Value to the Government. Only technical proposals with a technical rating of Outstanding or Highly Acceptable will be considered for award.

<DESC>Sources Sought


This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. Qualified sources are limited to 8(a), Hubzone, and small businesses including service disabled veteran owned small businesses, veteran owned small businesses and women owned small businesses. Those parties that have an interest and ability to provide FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) with the services detailed below should SUBMIT CAPABILITY STATEMENTS. The capability statement and supporting data that clearly illustrate/exhibit the contractor's ability to perform the specified requirement, such as previous similar services performed or resumes, must be submitted no later than February 5, 2007. An electronic copy and four hard copies of the capability statement and each supporting document shall be sent to the contact listed in this announcement. This IS NOT a request for proposals. This synopsis seeks to identify the interest from prospective contractors to assist FDA in the ongoing research, development, and implementation of CDRH's Medical Product Safety Network (MedSun).  

Project Description:     

MedSun is a CDRH adverse event reporting/feedback pilot program that has been funded since 2002 under a Task Order contract.  That contract expires in August 2007.  The MedSun program currently includes 350 hospitals and nursing homes which report on-line to CDRH about problems with the use of medical devices.  The program involves investigation of those problems, creating solutions to those issues, and providing feedback to the clinical community about the problems and the solutions.  Educational tools are developed to teach clinicians how to recognize device problems, how to write quality reports about those problems, and how to improve the safe and effective use of devices.  This development is a creative, ongoing process.  The program requires specific, advanced technical capabilities and knowledge.  The technical capabilities include: understanding and experience with sociological research, understanding and experience of surveys and sampling methodologies, experience with a wide array of large health data bases and national health care organizations, techniques for quality assurance, understanding of trend analysis, sound judgment about data quality and usefulness, and development of outcome measures. Technical capabilities also include a wide array of research techniques for special studies to understand the use of medical devices in the clinical community, the ability to present technical materials in written and graphical form to non-technical audiences, and a staff of nurses, physicians, and engineers highly knowledgeable of the use of medical devices in all areas of hospitals. In addition to these technical capabilities, a detailed understanding of federal and state policies related to collection of health care data and medical device adverse events is critical, as well as a detailed understanding of the medical device related statutes of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and the associated medical device regulations. 

Because the MedSun program is an ongoing program, there can be no time lag in transitioning the current program from the current contractor to a new contractor.  Therefore, a prospective candidate must have the in-house capability to be able to assume the full project and provide seamless workflow from the beginning of the new Task Order contract.

Describe in detail your proven capability and current in-house capacity to perform all the following required capabilities, as well as those cited in the Project Description paragraph, above:

Experience in recruiting a representative sample of acute-care hospitals for participation in long-term research efforts.

Experience in training hospital staff in use of electronic reporting system to report device-related events and providing technical support to more than 1000 system users.

Experience in maintaining on-going cooperation from health-care provider organizations in a national, large-scale patient safety reporting effort.

Demonstrated ability to maintain high level of data security handling sensitive data collected from health provider organizations; credibility with hospital community regarding collection and handling of organizationally sensitive data.

Capability to provide programming and systems support to FDA in maintaining and performing enhancements on secure on-line patient safety reporting system.

Demonstrated ability to obtain project participation of nationally-known patient safety experts in an advisory capacity.

Demonstrated ability to produce useful multi-media educational tools designed to teach clinicians to recognize and report problems with medical devices.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION HTC711-07-Q-0123 is issued for informational and planning purposes only.  The information requested by this synopsis will be used within United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.  Please note that USTRANSCOM will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this Request For Information (RFI).  USTRANSCOM requires listings of products and services that will be required to support / execute / perform / and provide the Defense Courier Service Surface Conveyance Tracking System for 52 Government owned vehicles worldwide. 

1.  PURPOSE.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain technical information regarding tracking capabilities for surface conveyances such as vans and trucks.  

2. BACKGROUND:  The Defense Courier Surface (DCS) is responsible for delivery of sensitive materials in several parts of the world.  In many cases, DCS-owned surface assets such as vans and trucks are used to deliver these items.

To help ensure the security and safe delivery of these materials, DCS is investigating options for the tracking and monitoring of its surface deliveries.  This RFI solicits from commercial vendors descriptions of capabilities and technologies that DCS might leverage to that end.

3.  HIGH-LEVEL DESIRED CAPABILITIES DESCRIPTION.  Vendor responses to this RFI should describe proposed technologies and capabilities that could be used to support the DCS conveyance tracking desired capabilities listed below.

a)	The capability should enable monitoring of DCS vans and trucks.  A ?conveyance manager? should be able to sit at an office workstation, display a geographic area of interest, and ? using that geographical display - show the last reported location of any DCS conveyances making deliveries in that region.
b)	The conveyance should automatically report its location at flexible time periods.  For example, highly sensitive deliveries might require position reports every 5 minutes; while less sensitive deliveries might require position reports every 30 minutes.
c)	The conveyance manager should automatically be alerted if the conveyance deviates significantly from an assigned route or if the conveyance falls significantly behind schedule.  The conveyance manager should be able to define business rules for route and schedule deviation, and other business rules that might be appropriate.
d)	The driver of the conveyance should have a capability to contact the conveyance manager in case of emergency.
e)	The conveyance should have the ability to connect other sensors to the system e.g. door opening, security cage breech and tip over/roll over sensors and relay information from these sensors to alert the conveyance manager when activated.
f)	The conveyance should include the ability to activate remote devices installed on the vehicle e.g. remote vehicle disabling, remote door lock/unlock.
g)	The driver of the conveyance should have a ?panic button? available in case of emergency.
h)	The conveyance should alert the conveyance manager automatically if the conveyance tips over
i)	Information from the conveyance tracking solution should be generically exportable to other software applications or systems as needed by DCS.

<ARCHDATE>09072007
<CONTACT>Ryan Annibali, 732-532-3832
<DESC>The US Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command intends to procure Agilent Technologies Test Equipment. It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price Contract will be awarded on a sole source basis to Agilent Technologies, 9780 S Mer idian Blvd., Englewood, CO 80112, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i) Only One Responsible Source.  CERDECs Software Defined Radio (SDR) capabilities require a suite of test equipment and supporting accessories that has the capability to support programs like the Radio Enabling Technologies, Nextgen Applications (RETNA) Software Defined Radio Defense Te chnology Objective (DTO). CERDECs JTRS Army Center of Excellence Laboratory also requires extensive radio frequency test capabilities to support its role in testing future JTRS Ground Mobile Radio (GMR) waveforms in support of the JTRS Joint Program Execu tive Office (JPEO).  The power meter E4417A is needed to accurately test the output power of power amplifiers as found in the JTRS GMR or the RETNA programs. Further this is needed to accurately gauge proper software control of amplifiers as found in software defined radios. T o measure High Frequency (HF) amplifier power levels  the E9304A power sensor which operates in the 9 kHz to 6 GHz is needed. To accurately measure high wattage levels as found in HF and VHF radios a higher power rating sensor is needed, in this case E9300B. To facilitate high power amplifier testing, antenna testing, or simply testing radio systems at full power level necessitates high power attenuators, in this case the 8498A rated for 25 Watts. To allow general lab hook up and testing of radio systems or an tennas an array of various attenuators is needed. These attenuators are also needed to accurately measure isolation and noise performance of JTRS and legacy tactical radio systems. These attenuators are 8491B-003, 8491B-006, 8491B-010, 8491B-020, 8491B-030 , and finally 8491B-060. To aid in isolation and noise performance testing precision and fully automated attenuators must be utilized. Electronically controlled 8494H 0-11 dB and 8496H 0  110 dB attenuators allow computer control to promote automated test ing as well offer precise attenuation values. The Type N interconnection kit 11716A, cables 8120-2703, mainframe chassis 3499A, mainframe modules 44470A, and remote attenuator drivers  11713A all support and augment the electronically controlled 8494H and 8496H attenuators to offer additional versatility in the use as a precise remotely controlled attenuator.  In addition to testing of radio hardware one may also need to verify the software control over radio hardware. This will be performed on CERDECs SDR-4000 or USRP in house software defined radio development platforms. To officially utilize one of CERDECs S DRs one must be able to transmit over the air. To accomplish this goal a complete transmitter or receiver chain must be built to augment the SDR. To provide for amplification for use by both the transmitter and receiver are the 83006A general purpose ampli fier and the 11909A low noise amplifier. External reference is also needed for testing and this will require function generator 33205A.  To provide realistic testing of radio systems one must test a number of radios together in a combined radio frequency network.  To fully assemble such a network, a number of power dividers and splitters is needed to combine radio communications. This is ac complished through the RF bridge 86205A, power divider 11636A, and the 11667A power splitter. RETNA has developed a power amplifier and is currently undergoing continuous refinement. To support continued development CERDEC must be able to independently verify performance of the RETNA power amplifier. To adequately power a power amplifier a high vol tage power supply is needed. The 300 Volt N5771A supply will adequately meet this need. In addition to power, voltage, current, and temperature will also need to be mon itored on any amplifier under test. The 34401A bench top meter and U1252A handheld meter provide the means to monitor this information and capture it in real time. Accessories such as the E2308A thermistor, additional probes 34132A, 30 Amp current shunt 34 330A, high voltage 40 kV probe 34136A, precise Kelvin probe 11059A, and the U1180A handheld thermistor allow the 34401A and U1252A meters to accomplish these data capture roles. This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Solicitation Number W15P7T-07-R-P449 is assigned for r eference purposes. The U.S. Army C-E LCMC has established the IBOP website as part of the Army's Single Face to Industry, to allow electronic posting of Solicitation for Request for Proposals (RFP) Request for Quotations (RFQ) and Invitation for Bids (IFB)  from C-E LCMC to Industry. All parties interested in doing business with C-E LCMC are invited to access, operate, send and receive information from the IBOP at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil. See Note 22 and 26.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil   Potential sources sought to participate in the regional standardization of Lancets and Lancet Devices. A.	General Information:      Southeast Region (TRBO Reg 3&4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Caro lina, and Tennessee announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of Lancets and Lancet Devices.   The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is intended that standardized product be obtained through the Do D Prime Vendor Program.    The major facilities in the area includes:  MacDill AFB, FL, Eglin AFB, FL, Keesler AFB, MS, Fort Benning, GA, Fort Gordon, GA, Fort Stewart, GA, Fort Jackson, SC, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL, Naval Hospital Beaufort, SC, and Naval Hospital Pensacola,  FL.        This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, (DSCP) Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreemen t (DAPA) with the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) AND A separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendo rs to distribute their items.  This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is NOT a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime Vendor program please access the web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.     The agreement with incentive pricing will be based on a committed volume for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from the date of award with three (3) - 12 month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  A single award is intended in this project; ho wever, the Southeast Region acknowledges the possibility of more than one vendor for this agreement. Consideration will be based on best value to Government, based on evaluation of factors listed here. Anticipated award date is October 2007.  The evaluatio n will be based on technical/company, clinical/performance, and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade off criteria.           Point of Contact is Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   B.	Products & Performance Required    The Southeast Region is seeking product lines in the category of Lancets and Lancet Devices.  The yearly estimated total volume for Lancets and Lancet Devices is $26,918.10.  This is based on the historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.     At the request of the Southeast Region MTFs vendors will provide on-site support, in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brand, types and p ackaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors    DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) Point of Contact (Name and phone number, fax, email address, and Solicitation Number) to Ginny Slayton, Virginia.slayton@us. army.mil (706) 787-2019 before 5:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement in order to remain competitive.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.      This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical/company criteria (Phase I), no charge product sa mples for clinical/performance evaluation (Phase II), and submission of electronic best price offers (Phase III).  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the So utheast Region that its initial submission responses, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before 5:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that fail to meet the re-submittal deadline will be disqualified.    D.  Evaluation Criteria    The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from nine Military Treatment facilities in the Southeast Region.  They are the final decision makers for this initiative.      Phase I.  Vendors will be required to the provide responses to the technical/company criteria outlined herein.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the solicitation response will be eliminated from the standardization process.  A Clinical Product T eam (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will review the responses and determine acceptability.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criter ia will be invited to participate in Phase II, the clinical/performance evaluation.      Phase II.  The TRBO will request specific product samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected MTFs.  Vendors are required to ship specific product samples and amounts directly to the MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar day s from the issue of the notice to ship samples.  Vendors products must be received in the MTFs by 5:00 P.M. EST on the 14th calendar day at the participating MTFs in order to remain in the competitive process.  Each vendor participating in Phase II is adv ised to confirm receipt of delivery of product samples and provide such information to the TRBO before 5:00 P.M. EST on the 14th calendar day in order to remain competitive.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days.     Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like scale with a 1-5 scoring format.  The scale descriptors are: one-not clinically acceptable and five-clinically superior product. The CPT has set a threshold of 3.0 for ac ceptability of product sample review for standardization.  Vendors, whose clinical /performance results are lower than a 3.0 average, will not be considered clinically acceptable and will be disqualified.  All clinical/performance questions weighted equall y.   Phase III.  After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, the vendors in the clinical/performance evaluation group who met the minimum 3.0 threshold will be invited to participate in Phase III, pricing evaluations.  Vendors will b e asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast Region, as well as to submit their best pricing offers in the event of more than one award.  Vendors will be given 14 calenda r days from the issue of notice to submit their best pricing offer.  Vendors who do not send their best pricing offers by 5:00 P.M. EST on the 14th calendar day to the TRBO office will be disqualified.       Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  Pricing will be evaluated based on the best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exc eed 5 years).  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.   1.  Phase I:  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation Requirements In Phase I, the CPT will review the following technical/company criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is: Generally responses to all questions in this section m ust demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or  products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has a DAPA for Lancets and Lancet Devices; 4) the quoter has an agreement covering the items, with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region; 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoters information provided  is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.).  The following technical/company criteria must be submitted before 5:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement in order to remain competitive:     a.	Vendor(s) must have and provide their DAPA number for Lancets and Lancet Devices.     b.	Will your company offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified)?  c.	Vendor(s) must have a separate agreement with Owens & Minor for distribution in the Southeast Region.  Must provide your prime vendor conversion number.  d.	Vendor(s) must identify all itemized brand(s) and styles that are manufactured and/or distributed for Lancets and Lancet Devices.   e.	Vendor(s) must identify if company has had any history of back orders and/or recalls for the Lancets and Lancet Devices.  Explaining the a) dates and duration b) cause, c) resolution. f.	Vendor(s) must identify company return goods policy & all warranties.   g.	Vendor(s) must identify the types of educational tools, materials or staff training that the company provides for Lancet and Lancet Devices.   h.	Vendor(s) must identify if their company provides 24/7 customer service. i.	Vendor(s) must be able to provide a full product line of Lancets and Lancet Devices to include but not limited to:  Safety & Non-Safety Lancets; a full range of blades/needle sizes; lancing devices and holders, retractable blades/needles, sterile, singl e use and disposable. j.	Vendor(s) must identify if safety features are an integral part of the lancets.  Provide electronic literature to support safety feature.    2.	Phase II:  Clinical/Performance Criteria Evaluation Requirements A CPT comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will facilitate evaluation of the products based upon the following clinical/performance evaluation criteria to determine acceptability:   a.	Lancet is simple and easy to use. b.	Safety feature provides a barrier between hands & blade/needle after use and remains protective through disposable. c.	Lancing device has minimal sound upon activation. d.	Safety feature easily engages in a one-handed activation. e.	Safety Lancet design allows for comfortable grip. f.	Safety feature can not be deactivated.    3. Phase III:  Price Evaluation Requirements                								              Technical/company (Phase I) and Clinical/performance (Phase II) factors will be evaluated first.  The technical/company and clinical/performance evaluations will determine who the acceptable offerors are.  Then the quotes (Phase III) will be compared regarding incentive price and the TPRB will perform a technical/price trade off (i.e., very superior technical capabilities may justify paying a higher price).  THE CLOSING DATE  IS 16 JULY 2007 5:00PM EDT.

<SUBJECT>Towed Array Production and Conversion
<DESC>This notice supersedes the previously published FEDBIZOPS notices of 30 April 2007 for Twin Line Arrays and 12 June 2007 for Towed Array Production and Conversion. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command in support of Naval Sea Systems Command, Program Executive Office Littoral & Mine Warfare (PEO LMW), Maritime Surveillance Systems (MSS) Program Office PMS 485 and other Navy activities requires additional TB-29A and TL-29A arrays (and related engineering services) in order to support the surveillance and submarine fleets in achieving their missions and intends to procure those materials and services.  The effort would include: â€¢ New procurement of up to five TL-29A arrays â€¢ New procurement of up to two TB-29A arrays â€¢ Conversion (and subsequent integration testing) of up to six submarine TB-29A arrays into three TL-29A arrays â€¢ Engineering support services â€¢ Provisioned Items Orders (PIOs) for TL-29A. The proposed acquisition would specifically provide for: â€¢ One new TL-29A array in FY08 with an option for one new TL-29A array or a potential conversion (vice a new array). â€¢ An FY 08 option for two TB-29A arrays for the submarine community. FY09 â€“ FY11 would be option years which include one array conversion in each year with an option in FY09 and FY11 for three new TL-29A production arrays, one in FY09 and two in FY11 for foreign programs. There may also be a requirement during FY08 â€“ FY11 for an unknown quantity of PIO items and for engineering services to complete conversion work and negligible repair efforts. The Government believes that Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors of Syracuse, NY with their previous requisite knowledge and technical expertise is the only contractor capable of fulfilling these requirements without substantial duplication of cost and without unacceptable delays. It is anticipated this contract will be awarded in December 2007.  The value of this contract is expected to be approximately $76,800,000.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 334511.  Please see Numbered Note 22. Response to this announcement should be addressed to Pamela Rose at pamela.rose@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration TYPE 1 DIABETES TRIALNET MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE EFFECTS OF METABOLIC CONTROL ON PROGRESSION OF TYPE 1 DIABETES
<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaborations with Industry to provide continuous subcutantous insulin infusion (CSII) pumps and continuous glucose sensors (CGSs) for use in a NIH-sponsored multi-center trial to evaluate the effects of intensive metabolic control in newly-diagnosed type 1 diabetes using a glucose sensor-insulin infusion pump closed-loop system at the onset of diabetes followed by continuous real-time glucose monitoring associated with continuous insulin infusion therapy. 

INTRODUCTION:

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is planning to conduct a multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tight metabolic control from diagnosis of type 1 diabetes on preservation of endogenous insulin production as measured by stimulated C-peptide.  The trial will be conducted by investigators participating in the NIDDK sponsored TrialNet consortium. Study aims are to (1) determine if early and sustained restoration of metabolic control preserves C-peptide production in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes compared to patients receiving routine diabetes management, and (2) to ascertain whether allowing surviving islet cells to be less metabolically active will impact the underlying autoimmune process of type 1 diabetes.

The TrialNet Metabolic Control Study will enroll 108 patients, age 3-20 years, with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.  Two-thirds of those enrolled will be randomized to the experimental treatment group while the other one-third will be randomized to standard treatment.  Patients assigned to the experimental treatment group will have their insulin administered using a glucose sensor-insulin infusion pump closed-loop system within one week of diagnosis.  If admitted for ketoacidosis, the closed-loop system will begin when meals are initiated.  The closed-loop system will consist of a subcutaneous glucose sensor with insulin pump for intravenous or subcutaneous insulin delivery.  On discontinuing the closed-loop system, patients will be started on CGS monitoring in real time in conjunction with a CSII pump.  Patients assigned to standard treatment will receive conventional treatment for newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.  Study subjects will be enrolled over a one year period and then followed for two years.  Primary outcome is the effect of tight metabolic control on the maintenance of the C-peptide area under the curve in response to a mixed meal at one year following enrollment and secondary outcomes will include the effect of metabolic control on immunologic assays relevant to type 1 diabetes.

STUDY GOAL:  The goal of this study is to determine whether intensive metabolic control of type 1 diabetes from the time of diagnosis preserves residual ?? cell function and therefore insulin secretion, improving blood glucose control and decreasing the negative short- and long-term consequences of hyperglycemia.  

CAPABILITY STATEMENT:  The ??Collaborator Capability Statements?? received in response to this announcement will be reviewed by a Selection Committee.  The Committee will utilize the information provided in the ??Collaborator Capability Statements?? received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed ten (10) pages of narrative (not including appendices) and should address all of the following selection criteria:

1.	The statement must include all clinical data available on the use of the device(s).
2.	The statement must include the most recent Investigator??s Brochure for such devices.
3.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of device(s) according to a mutually agreed upon schedule for the duration of the Metabolic Control Study to be conducted by TrialNet.
4.	The statement should indicate willingness to supply the device(s) for immediate use in the TrialNet Metabolic Control Study.
5.	The statement must indicate willingness to provide TrialNet with cross-reference letter for FDA access to the Device Master File and any other documents that may be necessary to file the IDE.
6.	The statement must indicate willingness to have data collection and analysis performed by the TrialNet Coordinating Center (TNCC).
7.	The statement must indicate willingness to agree to share the complete adverse event profile from human studies of the device(s) with the TrialNet Consortium.
8.	The statement must indicate willingness to agree to share all unanticipated adverse device effects safety data from other studies involving their device(s) with the TrialNet Consortium.
9.	The statement should indicate willingness to have the device(s) used in conjunction with other device(s) used in the TrialNet Metabolic Control Study.
10.	The statement should address willingness to have the device(s) used at all TrialNet study sites involved in the Metabolic Control Study, including those in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
11.	The statement must address willingness to allow prompt publication of research results.
12.	The statement must include a description of the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.

For the In-Hospital Closed Loop System:  

1.	The system should have a CGS which communicates with either a computer or hand-held device (PDA).  The computer or device must contain an algorithm for determining insulin delivery based on the CGS signal (absolute value and rate of change) and must then communicate the information to a CSII pump.
2.	The sensor should have accuracy with a Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) of <15% excluding glucose values used to calibrate the device.
3.	The algorithm should have been previously tested in human subjects with at least 500 hours of viable clinical data.

For the Out-Patient (Home) Real Time CGS Augmented CSII Pump System:

1.	The real-time CGS should provide data in real time with rate of change information and alarms for hyper- and hypoglycemia.
2.	The CSII pump should calculate insulin doses based on carbohydrate to insulin ratios and insulin sensitivity factors.
3.	The information from the CGS and CSII pump needs to be downloadable into an integrated database for the subject to review glucose trends and patterns in association with their insulin doses and carbohydrate intake.  This data must be able to be viewed by subjects and study staff on a study website.    
4.	The information from the CGS and CSII pump should be analyzable by a computer program which recognizes patterns and then provides study staff with recommendations for changes in insulin therapy which can then be communicated to the patient.
5.	The Collaborator must be willing to work with the TrialNet Biostatistics Coordinating Center (BSC) to assure that the data generated by the CGS and CSII pump is in a format compatible with the BSC database.   

Potential Industry Collaborators can provide some or all of the devices to be used during the TrialNet Metabolic Control study.  Three to six TrialNet sites will conduct the study, and each site will need sufficient complete closed-loop apparatus for the study of two subjects simultaneously.  In addition, the TrialNet sites will need to provide the components of the open-loop system to approximately 108 study subjects.  

Potential Collaborators should submit a brief capability statement to the contact person noted below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  The Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) into which the selected Collaborator is expected to enter is an agreement designed to enable a collaboration between Government laboratories and industry. IT IS NOT A GRANT, AND IS NOT A CONTRACT FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF GOODS OR SERVICES. The NIH is prohibited from transferring funds to a CTA collaborator.  Under a CTA, NIH can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort.  The Collaborator typically contributes materials and expertise to the collaboration.  This will be an in-kind collaborative arrangement.

SUBMISSION DATES:  Only written capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before July 13, 2007 will be considered.

Description
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - Routing Protocols and Management (RPM) for High Capacity Networks

Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is requesting information on revolutionary ideas and approaches to map administrative, business, and war fighting mission requirements to the supporting networks and information systems.  The requested information is sought to determine if industry has ideas that warrant specific project-oriented investment by DARPA in this area.  No funding has currently been allocated to this effort.  A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and/or other solicitation may or may not result from the findings of this Request for Information (RFI).  




Introduction

Modern communications networks were designed and developed when memory and processing power were limiting factors rather than plentiful and generally ubiquitous throughout the network.  Today's environment finds memory and processing power available even at the tactical edge of the Global Information Grid (GIG).  Routing Protocols and Management (RPM) for High Capacity Networks is considering methods to re-think and potentially redesign some of the basic concepts that have shaped today's Internet technology.  The goal of any DARPA program in this area is to improve transfer speeds, network routing efficiency, reliability, simplify network configuration, and reduce cost.  

Problem Definition

Modern communications networks were designed and developed when memory and processing power were limiting factors rather than plentiful and generally ubiquitous throughout the network.  Today's environment finds memory and processing power available even at the tactical edge of the Global Information Grid (GIG).  Routing Protocols and Management (RPM) for High Capacity Networks is considering methods to re-think and potentially redesign some of the basic concepts that have shaped today's Internet technology.  The goal of any DARPA program in this area is to improve transfer speeds, network routing efficiency, reliability, simplify network configuration, and reduce cost.  

Problem Definition

DARPA is interested in ideas that will lead to the development of new addressing schemes (e.g., a structured hierarchical addressing system) to supplement the current IP scheme.  New addressing schemes should make the network faster, cheaper, or easier to administer.  Additionally, we hope to implement a prioritization system to allow higher priority traffic faster service through the network, along with the authentication system such a system requires.  

This RFI seeks ways to enhance network prioritization and authentication for priority users; create multipath route discovery and distribution; lower manpower requirements for network configuration; and efficiently connect Dense Wave Division Multiplex (DWDM) networks and conventional IP networks.  The program assumes the existence of DWDM switched networks and seeks to make the connection between a normal IP network and a DWDM switched network as simple and efficient as possible.

The long-term goal is to develop new systems that use network capacity as efficiently and inexpensively as possible.  Ideas that require modifications to addressing schemes (e.g., modifying IP), changes to the Domain Name Server (DNS), or other established Internet Standards are acceptable as long as these changes can be justified.

DARPA is interested in responses describing the solution with low granularity, at the device or process level, rather than at the macro or enterprise level.  DARPA is interested in autonomic or semi-autonomic systems that require little manual intervention.  Finally, simplicity and ability to transition a solution are of interest - large theoretical systems that require extensive training to operate would be of little value as a potential program.

DARPA is not interested in evolutionary improvements to existing fielded or commercial systems, nor funding requests or investment opportunities to bring existing work into production.  This RFI seeks potential high-risk, high payoff research opportunities related to Routing Protocols and Management for High Capacity Networks that may provide revolutionary capabilities for the Department of Defense.  
 
Request for Information Focus Areas

In an effort to shape future work on Routing Protocols and Management for High Capacity Networks, DARPA/STO is soliciting position papers addressing the following areas:
1. Concepts and ideas for novel methods to allow multipath route discovery and multipath route distribution; improve network routing efficiency and reliability; simplify network configuration and management; provide for different levels of priority and precedence; and improve authentication/attribution.  

 2. Technical methods to efficiently and inexpensively interconnect DWDM networks and conventional IP networks.  These can be linked to, a part of, or separate from a submission for #1 above. 
3. The impact of your proposed idea(s) on the personnel needed to operate networks
4. Potential metrics to measure the effectiveness of what you propose

Workshop

DARPA will hold a workshop for selected RFI respondents in the vicinity of Arlington, VA in October 07. The workshop may include an overview of previous DARPA programs, historical assumptions, today's requirements and challenges, invited presentations, submitter presentations, discussions, and Q&A. Respondents interested in attending should visit the registration website at https://www.enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=NEX74474

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES    (JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

(End of provision)
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
Commandant (G-A)
U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters
Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement
1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402
Washington, DC  20593
Telephone: (202) 372-3692
 Fax: (202) 475-3904
Closing date and time for receipt of offers is August 3, 2007, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about August 3, 2007.  Contact Sheila Midgette at 252-335-6493 or Sheila.G.Midgette@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-A)

(End of provision) 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-A)

STATEMENT OF WORK:
Helicopter Transportation between Kodiak, AK and various NDS sites in the Kodiak AOR


1.0	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE

1.1	The Coast Guard MLCP(te-3) has a project to replace the existing analog microwave system with a digital microwave system.  This requires that we have technicians at both the mountain top site and the link site. The only access to the mountain tip sites and link sites is via helicopter transportation.

2.0	REQUIRED COMPLETION DATE

2.1	On or before 30 September 2007. The actual completion date will depend on equipment availability, personnel and helicopter availability. We need a window to complete this installation between 10 July through 30 September. We need this large window as weather, personnel, equipment and helicopter availability play a major role in planning and scheduling purposes.

2.2	Transportation schedule will be arranged by installation team. Transportation can be accomplished during daylight hours seven days a week at the direction of the Helicopter Charter.

3.0	CONTRACTOR FURNISHED EQUIPMENT

3.1	The contractor shall provide helicopter transportation form Kodiak, AK to Cape Gull and return. At this time the installation team plans to spend one night on site at Cape Gull. This will require a return trip from Cape Gull to Kodiak on a separate day.

3.2	The contractor shall provide helicopter transportation from Kodiak, AK to Raspberry Island and return. At this time the installation team plans to spend one night on site at Raspberry Island. This will require a return trip from Raspberry Island to Kodiak on a separate day. The second phase of the project will require transportation of personnel, equipment and tools to Raspberry Island in late August. This will require an additional two round trips between Kodiak and Raspberry Island. The second phase of the installation will be coordinated with the installation at Sheratin Mtn as this will require coordinated efforts of teams on Sheratin Mountain, Raspberry Island and Pillar Mountain.

3.3	The contractor shall provide helicopter transportation form Kodiak, AK to Sitkinak Island and return. At this time the installation team plans to spend one night on site at Sitkinak Island. This will require a return trip from Sitkinak Island to Kodiak on a separate day. We are investigating the possibility of fixed wing transportation to Akiok and Sitkinak Island at this time. 

3.4	The contractor shall provide helicopter transportation from Kodiak, AK to Akiok and return. At this time the installation team plans to spend one night on site at Akiok.  This will require a return trip from Akiok to Kodiak on a separate day.

3.5	The contractor shall provide helicopter transportation from Kodia, AK to Sheratin Mtn and return. Many trips will be required as batteries, antennas, personnel, tools and microwave repeaters will be transported to and from the site. Estimated flight time between Kodiak and Sheratin Mtn is 30 min round trip. This installation will happen in stages over a couple months. Number of trips is only an estimate and will more than likely change.

3.6	This installation crew will consist of two technicians and approximately 200-300 pounds of equipment, tools and survival gear. These weights are only estimates and may increase or decrease once we have all the equipment and tools in Kodiak, AK. This may require a second trip to get all gear and personnel to and from the site.

4.0	POINT OF CONTACT

4.1	The USCG POC for the Statement of Work is CWO Randell Meyers at 510-637-5418 (desk) 510-637-5498 (fax)

<DESC>70 - General purpose information technology equipment.
The solicitation number is ITBPA2007.  The solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-13.

The requirements will be fulfilled using the Simplified Acquisition procedures, Part 13 of the FAR, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG), to the maximum extent possible.  

This is a total small business set-aside.  The associated North American Classification System (NAICS) code is 443120 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) established Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for Information Technology (IT) requirements for computer hardware and software products in July 2004.  The USPTO intends to add to its existing BPA vendors to fulfill its continuing IT requirements for computer hardware and software products and to further competition.   The USPTO expects to make multiple awards resulting from this synopsis/solicitation. The USPTO's IT product requirements for FY 2006 were approximately $95.5 million, approximately $30 million of which was fulfilled by the BPA Holders for IT Products.  There is, however, no guarantee of requirements. Vendors are not required to have a General Services Administration (GSA) contract in order to submit a proposal in response to this RFQ.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the USPTO.  Teaming is allowed and the USPTO encourages teaming with other small businesses. All BPA orders are generally competed among the BPA holders using simplified acquisition procedures. However, the USPTO reserves the right to limit competition for individual requirements to selected BPA holders, i.e., HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran-owned businesses, to accomplish its socio-economic goals.  The BPAs will have a period of performance of 5 years.  In accordance with FAR 13.303-6, the USPTO will review the BPA at least annually.  If necessary, the USPTO will update or modify existing arrangements as a result of i.e, "changes in market conditions, sources of supply, and other pertinent factors that may warrant making new arrangements with different suppliers or modifying existing arrangements."  The USPTO reserves the right to cancel any company's BPA for any reason, including but not limited to: poor performance, failure to respond to requests for quotes, vendor's prices are determined to be no longer competitive, and all of the reasons listed under FAR 13.303-6(b)(2).      

The Government is seeking a one-stop shopping vehicle, which offers a wide array of computer hardware and software products to include computer hardware, software and licenses, and maintenance that is found under Schedule 70 - General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services. Examples of items that the USPTO may be procuring are:  servers, server racks, color scanners, mass storage units, fiber channel ports and fabric management software, dual port fibre channel cards, routers and switches, security software, automated tape libraries, data tape cartridges, security software, and virus control software.  The vendor must be able to demonstrate that they can offer the USPTO a vast array of IT Products.  The USPTO is not looking for vendors who can only offer a few products or product brands.  Vendors who can only offer a few products and/or limited product brands will be found unacceptable, and will not be considered for award.  Currently, the USPTO has an existing contract vehicle under which it procures desktop computer hardware.  Items on the desktop computer hardware contract vehicle are excluded from these BPAs.   Blanket Purchase Agreement Calls (BPCs) will be issued for any orders placed under any awarded BPA.   Offerors must be authorized dealers or resellers of products that they are offering to the Government at the time of the offering.  The USPTO does not purchase grey market IT products.  Vendors that submit proposals in response to this synopsis/solicitation are required to have been in business for three years or longer.  Vendors that submit proposals who do not meet this requirement will be disqualified and eliminated from competition. The vendor must have the financial resources or the ability to establish lines of credit that will allow the company to fulfill USPTO's IT requirements.  
  
Individual awarded BPCs will state the date and place of delivery, and acceptance and FOB point.  Place of delivery may vary but most hardware deliveries will go to the USPTO warehouse located in Alexandria, VA, 22314.

Factors:  (1) Ability to provide a vast array of computer hardware and software products, (2) Past Performance and Experience, (3) Other Factors, and (4) Price.
    
The provision at 52.212.1, Instructions to Offeror-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  In addition, Offerors are required to submit the following:
(1) Brief capabilities statement addressing ability to provide a vast array of IT Products, not to exceed 5 pages, with optional catalogs and brochures (Capabilities statement, catalogs, and brochures shall not exceed 20 pages in length); (2)(a), a completed Past Performance Evaluation Order submitted to Open Ratings, Inc.; and (2)(b), references to substantiate sales from 5 current customers with whom the offeror has had an established relationship for over one year and sales in excess of $50,000 for the year; and (3) brief capabilities addressing Other Factors, not to exceed 3 pages; and (4) prices for products.  Specifications for products that the vendor must price are listed at: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm. 
Documentation provided for past performance references (item #2 above) will not count toward the 20-page limitation.  There is no required format for the capabilities statement. Table of contents and any cover letter will not be included in the 20-page limitation.    The cover letter and any information contained in the cover letter will not be evaluated.

This project requires a detailed and broad understanding of various types of North Carolina and other state and local level datasets, survey instruments, and other tools useful for health services research including public health.  The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research is one of the nation's oldest and largest health services research centers.  Located on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the center encompasses an interdisciplinary program of research, consultation, technical assistance and training focusing on the accessibility, adequacy, organization, cost and effectiveness of health care services.  Sheps Center staff regularly conduct research with datasets for projects studying hospital networks, nursing home residents' attitudes, childhood immunizations receipt, measure of medical under service, and telemedicine.  This work encompasses identifying, locating and evaluating the usefulness of data files and/or instruments for projects.  The Center's expert health services researchers frequently use data sources such as physician supply, general demographics, rural/urban indicators, and hospital survey information.  Staff use data files for specific projects such as disease incidence, locations of federally supported health clinics, regional economic indicators, residential socioeconomic status indicators, population projections, industry-specific employment, toxic waste sites, and hospital discharge data.  Additionally, Sheps Center staff  have developed several North Carolina state data systems with local level data including the North Carolina Health Professions Data System.  Sheps Center staff are expert health services researchers and librarians skilled in identification, evaluation and analysis and use of HSR and public health datasets and instruments and searching HSR information systems and are, therefore, uniquely qualified to evaluate North Carolina and other state and local level data tools and identify those suitable for the HSRR database and to create in-depth individual records.

<DESC>70 - General purpose information technology equipment.
The solicitation number is ITBPA2007.  THE CLOSING DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS IS REVISED TO 11:00 AM EST, JANUARY 3, 2007.

Updates to this synopsis/solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov), as well as the USPTO Office of Procurement homepage at: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm.  This solicitation shall not be construed as a commitment of any kind.    
 beyond that time?
The current BPAs have two remaining options, if exercised, which will extend out to 6/30/2009. It is up to the USPTO if it wishes to exercise the options. 

10.  Will you provide extensions to current BPAs to match that of the new BPAs that you will be awarding in the future?
No.  The current BPAs were awarded with a basic period of two years, and three one-year options, for a potential of five years.  The new BPA will have a five-year period of performance, as with the previous BPAs.  It is unknown at this time whether the current BPAs will be allowed to expire on 6/30/2009, or re-competed.

11.  Will the Government contemplate relaxing the requirement in Item C of the Supplemental Instructions, Factor #2(b), to permit quotations from vendors with less than 5 long-standing customers at less than $50,000.00/year volume, and if so, what would the volume be?
No.  The USPTO has already lowered the requirement from the previous BPA. The previous BPA included the requirement that the company furnish references that had an established relationship for over one year, and sales in excess of $100,000 for the year.  

12. Attachment 2 ? Nortel Data Switches:  It appears that several of the specifications called out are obsolete technology and we assume that it is acceptable for us to bid the latest technology that will either meet or exceed the published specifications, could you please confirm that this is acceptable to the USPTO?
Yes. Specifically, the combined synopsis/solicitation stated:  ?If a part number has changed or been replaced for the hardware or software as a result of an upgrade by the manufacturer, the offeror is to price the most recent version or replacement part number.  The offeror shall note the new part or version number on its pricing documentation.?

13.  Is this BPA based on an existing contract? 
There were BPAs awarded in 2004 for IT Products, the same as this.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued to add to those awarded in 2004.

14.   Does this Small Business Set-Aside BPA require products to be provided from small business manufacturers?  Will the non-manufacturer rule apply?
As the purpose of this RFQ is to establish a BPA and specific requirements are not identified at this time, the nonmanufacturer rule does not apply. If it is determined necessary to seek a waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule, the USPTO contracting officer will contact the SBA. 

15.   If we are a Prime on this BPA with a team of various small businesses that we currently partner with would all PO's come through our company (small business) or would they or could they go directly to some of our partners who are HUBZone, SDV-O, & Minority-owned to meet some of your socio-economic goals?
The BPA will be issued to the prime only and orders will only be issued to the prime.
  
16.   The RFP states that $30 million of IT purchased in FY 2006 were fulfilled by BPA Holders for IT products.  Please clarify if the $30 million is for the BPA currently being competed or does this figure include other IT BPA's?  
As stated in the synopsis/solicitation: ?The USPTO?s IT product requirements for FY 2006 were approximately $95.5 million, approximately $30 million of which was (emphasis added) fulfilled by the BPA Holders for IT Products.? No, the $30 million is not for the BPA currently being competed.  This is the amount of requirements which were fulfilled in FY2006 utilizing the existing BPAs.  The approximate figure of $30 million was disclosed so companies would have a better understanding of the volume that the USPTO procured in FY 2006 using the existing BPAs. 
 
17.  Reference Attachment 6 and 7 - PowerEdge 2850 and PowerEdge 1850:  Due to recent technology refreshes the PowerEdge 2850 and 1850 have recently been transitioned to the PowerEdge 2950 and 1950, we assume that it is acceptable for us to bid the latest technology that will either meet or exceed the published specifications, could you please confirm that this acceptable to the USPTO? 
Yes. Specifically, the combined synopsis/solicitation stated:  ?If a part number has changed or been replaced for the hardware or software as a result of an upgrade by the manufacturer, the offeror is to price the most recent version or replacement part number.  The offeror shall note the new part or version number on its pricing documentation.?

18.  Reference Quotes for Dell PowerEdge 2860 servers:  Dell no longer offers the 2850, but offers the 2950.  In this case the specs for the 2950 are different.  Is there any chance the end user my issue new specs for these requests? 
New specs will not be issued since it is not the USPTO?s intent to issue any orders at this time. The purpose of providing the specifications for specific items is to obtain pricing information to conduct price evaluation. As specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, ?If a part number has changed or been replaced for the hardware or software as a result of an upgrade by the manufacturer, the offeror is to price the most recent version or replacement part number.  The offeror shall note the new part or version number on its pricing documentation.?  

Reminder: The receipt date and time for proposals is 11:00 a.m. EST, January 3, 2007.   Updates to this synopsis/solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov), as well as the USPTO Office of Procurement homepage at: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm.  This solicitation shall not be construed as a commitment of any kind.

<DESC>Amendment 2 

Questions and Answers, Ref: Synopsis/Solicitation No. ITBPA2007

1. Please provide estimated award date.
There is no estimated award date at this time.  Award of the BPAs will depend on the number of proposals which are received.   Based upon the number of proposals we received last time, it may take up to 6 months.
 
2. Page 2 - In reference to the various specifications provided, can you please further clarify the following statement: ?The USPTO is not looking for vendors who can only offer a few products or product brands.? Can it be assumed that alternate product brands can be offered in lieu of the product brands listed or is this an all or nothing RFQ?

As stated in the synopsis/solicitation, ?Vendors who can only offer a few products and/or limited product brands will be found unacceptable, and will not be considered for award?.  A vendor which can only offer to sell the PTO, for example, security software, would be found unacceptable because it cannot offer a vast array of IT Products.   Since the purpose of this BPA is to fulfill future requirements which are unknown at this time, offering alternate products is not an option.  There will be no stated prices, or product brands listed in the awarded BPAs.  Requirements will be competed among the awarded BPA holders as the requirements are identified.  

3. E. (page 4) it says that ??the vendor must select 5 specifications to price?? does that mean we can just choose not to price those items that we are not authorized to sell?

In order to consider price, which is required, the vendor must price 5 specifications.  The vendor may price any of the specifications, regardless of whether or not it is authorized to sell the particular product.  However, once the BPAs are awarded, vendors must be authorized to sell the products which they are quoting.  As stated in the synopsis/solicitation, ?The prices will be used strictly for evaluation purposes only.? There will not be any orders resulting from this pricing.

4. Pages 3 and 4 - Under ?Supplemental Instructions? ?
Please clarify under B. if you are requesting past performance evaluations from trade references.
Reference Factor No. 2(a), the USPTO is requesting past performance evaluations from the vendor?s customers.  Customers could include companies, federal government agencies, state or local governments, etc., which the Offeror has sold IT products similar to those identified in the synopsis/solicitation.

5.  Please confirm you are asking for customer references under C. (regarding Factor No. 2(b). 
The USPTO is requesting ?customer references? under Factor No. 2(b), with whom the offeror has had an established relationship for over one year and has had sales for IT products in excess of $50,000 per year.

6.  Confirm that the NACIS code 443120 is for 500 employees or fewer is the small business size for this solicitation.
The nonmanufacturer size standard of 500 employees shall be used for purposes of Government procurement of supplies.  This BPA is for supplies; therefore, the small business size standard of 500 employees will apply.

7.  In regards to solicitation ITBPA2007 how many awards is the Patent and Trademark Office anticipating will be awarded?
It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made.  The USPTO wishes to remain flexible in the number of awards it may make.

8.  Please confirm that current BPA holders cannot submit a response to the new BPA solicitation.
The current BPA holders already have a BPA; therefore, it is not necessary to submit a proposal.  The current BPA awards, if all of the options are exercised, will extend out to 6/30/2009.  As a reminder, the previous combined synopsis/solicitation under which the current BPA holders were awarded stated ?the USPTO may solicit additional companies at any time to replace or increase existing BPAs to fulfill the USPTO?s requirements?.

9. Since our BPA expires in June of 2007, how do we continue our BPA

Final Questions and Answers NAMA-07-R-0010
Quote due No Later Than 3:00 PM, June 20, 2007

Question - This is not a color system correct?     
Answer - Correct, both the roll-film microfilm and microfiche scanners are to produce grayscale or bi-tonal images, they are not color scanners.

Question - Should we ignore the speed issues for Production Environment for the microfiche scanner?     
Answer - The production capacity cited in the RFP is incorrect, the production capacity for microfiche scanners should be 15,000 to 35,000 images per day.

Question- Will remote access to the scan stations and server be allowed for 
support purposes?
Answer- At this time, remote access is not possible. We are working on trying to make it possible.

Question- If remote access is allowed, does the NARA have existing preferred 
remote access software to be installed on the systems, or will that be 
up to the contractor to provide?
Answer- Since currently there is no remote access, we do not have a preferred remote access software application at this time.

Question- Will the NARA be providing the equipment and media to perform the backups, or should this be included in the proposal?
Answer: Mass digital storage and back-up of digital files is not part of this acquisition. NARA is working on these needs and functionality separately.

Question- How many different digitization projects will be going on during the 
period of performance?
Answer: The number of projects at any given time will vary. Typically, it may be between 8 and 16 on-going or longer-term projects across all of our lab areas, and many individual work requests.

Question- The document mentions that the local network shared drives are currently being backed up to tape devices.  I did not see any other mention of a backup strategy for the integrated system.
Answer:  NARA is working on the Electronic Records Archives (ERA, info at- http://www.archives.gov/era/). All digital copies we create using the equipment to be purchased under this acquisition will likely be stored and managed over the long-term in the ERA infrastructure.
