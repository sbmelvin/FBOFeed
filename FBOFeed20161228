<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is hereby seeking industry comments for the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for the MSFC and Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) Protective Services (MMPS) requirement. A Sources Sought Notice for this requirement was previously posted on August 24, 2015, under NNM15558047L to include a Request for Information (RFI). <br /><br /><br />The DRFP is not a solicitation but is issued as an acquisition planning instrument and as a means of soliciting industry comments for use in developing the RFP. This draft does not commit MSFC to pay any proposal preparation costs, nor does it obligate NASA MSFC to procure or contract for these activities. This request should not be construed as authorization to proceed with, or be paid for charges incurred by performing any of the work called for in this DRFP.
<p><br />The purpose of the DRFP is to assist the Government in developing the highest quality RFP. Prospective Offerors in accordance with NFS 1815.201, Exchanges with Industry Before Receipt of Proposals, are invited to: (1) comment on all aspects of the draft RFP, including the requirements, schedules, proposal instructions, and evaluation approaches; (2) identify unnecessary or inefficient requirements; and (3) comment on any perceived safety, occupational, health, security (including information technology security), environmental, export control, or other programmatic risk issues associated with performance of the work.</p>
<p><br />An Industry Day Virtual Meeting will be held on December 5, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. CT. The Industry Day Virtual Meeting is for informational purposes only.

<p><br />This requirement is a follow-on to NNM12AA08C which was awarded to Excalibur Associates, Inc. as a Firm-Fixed price (FFP) Mission contract with a FFP Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) element. The MMPS contract currently provides a variety of protective services for MSFC and MAF including physical security operations, personnel security, technology protection, emergency operations, and training requirements. <br /><br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services with a size standard of $20.5M.</p>
<p><br />It is currently estimated that the RFP seeking proposals from interested and qualified Offerors will be posted on or about January 13, 2017. It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for the eventual release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).</p>

<p><br />The National Institute of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC) intends to award a one year fixed price purchase order to American Association of Blood Banks, Inc. Bethesda, MD DUNS# 072645492 on a sole source basis to procure blood and blood products necessary for patient treatment, often critically ill patients involved in clinical trials.</p>
<p>Blood and blood products such as red blood cells leuko reduced, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelets pheresis leuko reduced are critical to support the mission of the NIH CC, Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM). Blood supply is not easily estimated as it based on patient protocol, volume, and need. Urgent and rare blood supplies may be needed at any given time for life sustaining purposes. American Association of Blood Banks is distinctively able to provide supplemental blood and blood products when insufficient products are able to be collected by DTM to provide adequate blood inventory to support Clinical Center patients.</p>
<p>American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) is uniquely qualified due to its affiliation with blood centers nationwide to locate and obtain blood from blood centers with surplus inventory to alleviate regional blood shortages that can't be managed by local or even regional blood suppliers. AABB relies on a nationwide network of FDA licensed blood facilities with a surplus of blood and blood components. There is no other known blood supplier that possesses a nationwide network clearinghouse that enables the association to become a resource-sharing network. There is 24/7 access to the AABB team who is ready to assist with locating and shipping blood components at all times.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b). Interested concerns capable of providing the same or similar products or services as described in this notice may submit a capability statement outlining their capabilities. Capability Statements must be received within the time set forth in this synopsis to be considered by the Government. A determination to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />Each response should include the following Business Information:<br />a. DUNS.<br />b. Company Name, address, POC, Phone and Email address<br />c. Current GSA Schedules or NAICS codes appropriate to this Award.<br />d. Type of Company (i.e., small business, 8(a), woman owned, hubZone, veteran owned, etc.) as validated in System For Award Management (SAM). All offerors must register on the SAM located at http://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/#1 <br />e. Capability Statement</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Trustees of Boston University, 85 E Newton St M-921, Boston, MA, 02118-2340, to procure Forensic Genotyping of 2270 DNA samples from Offspring Exam 8 on behalf of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) Framingham Heart Study.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; NHLBI) -- embarked on an ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic.</p>
<p>The objective of the Framingham Heart Study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The Framingham Heart Study continues to make important scientific contributions by enhancing its research capabilities and capitalizing on its inherent resources. New diagnostic technologies, such as echocardiography (an ultrasound examination of the heart), carotid-artery ultrasound, bone densitometry (for monitoring osteoporosis), and computerized tomography of the coronary arteries, are evaluated and integrated into ongoing protocols.</p>
<p>While pursuing the study's established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators are expanding their research into other areas such as the role of genetic factors in CVD. Framingham investigators also collaborate with leading researchers from around the country and throughout the world on projects in stroke and dementia, osteoporosis and arthritis, nutrition, diabetes, eye diseases, hearing disorders, lung diseases, and genetic patterns of common diseases.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure Forensic Genotyping of 2270 DNA samples from Offspring Exam 8. The contractor will provide services to isolate and aliquot RNA from existing Framingham Heart Study (FHS) PAXGENE samples.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>For this procurement, the contractor shall:</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide services to isolate and aliquot RNA from the pre-existing Framingham Heart Study PAXGENE samples.<br />&bull;	RNA will be QC'd with a RIN number determination<br />&bull;	Remaining isolated RNA will be aliquoted into appropriate size aliquots and returned to FHS Genetics lab for storage and consumption as determined by the FHS Genetics Committee.<br />&bull;	Return of results by the Contractor will be accompanied by summary quality control measures for each sample.<br />&bull;	QC data will be returned to FHS within 20-30 weeks of receipt of the Isolated RNA samples.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that the primary PaxGene samples, from which the RNA will be isolated, currently reside in The Framingham Heart Study Genetics Lab at Boston University. These samples are all non-renewable resources and must remain in the custody of Boston University for scientific continuity. Consistency is critical to data validity, and we must ensure that experimental protocols are maintained and unchanged for all studies performed, as any changes to the protocol could skew results and invalidate current work practices.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b), soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

<p>The use of the MATOC will provide the Government with a construction product delivery method that can accommodate quick and straight-forward projects, as well as some small but complex projects, and can help minimize design effort and related overhead expenditures, as well as handle compressed schedules. The Government will evaluate and select, for contract award, two (2) to five (5) qualified Offerors, whose Proposals are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with consideration given to both the technical evaluation factors and price.</p>
<p>Task Orders will primarily address new construction, design-build or design-bid-build, general building renovation, road and airfield pavement repair, utility work to include water, sewer, electrical, and gas, and general environmental work including, but not limited to, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical, concrete work, and environmental remedial work. This solicitation will cover the geographical area of Georgia (country).</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, a two-phase source selection process will be used to evaluate the contractors for award. Those contractors who are considered most qualified during Phase I (not to exceed five (5) contractors) will be requested to submit the proposal requirements for Phase II. Specific evaluation criteria will be provided in the solicitation documents.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of the MATOC is not-to-exceed US$30,000,000.00 for the life of the contract, which will consist of a base period of three (3) years and two (2) one(1)-year option periods. The Contract will end upon completion of the five (5) years (if all options are exercised) or upon attainment of the US$30,000,000.00 capacity. Individual projects issued under the MATOC will contain their own estimated values. There will be no limits on the number of task orders awarded/issued in any year. The minimum guarantee shall be $5,000.00. This amount shall cover the duration of the entire contract (Base Period and Option Periods).</p>
<p>The Corps of Engineers, Europe District intends to advertise the solicitation for this MATOC on or about 28 Dec 2015. Only firms that the U.S. Government determines qualified will be included as a part of a Restricted Plan Holders List (RPHL). Only qualified firms on the RPHL will be invited to participate and be provided a copy of the solicitation.</p>
<p>If the Offeror wishes to perform some of the work using subcontractors (subject to the 25% prime contractor work requirement stated in FAR 52.236-1, Performance of Work by the Contractor), the prime contractor may use subcontractors of any nationality providing they submit commitment letters from those subcontractors. The contractor may not change subcontractors without the Contracting Officer's approval. Approval will not be given unless the contracting officer, in the exercise of his/her sole discretion, considers the proposed substitute to be equal in all respects to the originally proposed subcontractor and the contracting officer considers the substitution to be in the best interests of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a cryogen-free cryostat to study optomechanical systems in a regime where the mechanical motion is near the quantum zero-point motion.
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified business sources. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>NOTE: This notice is strictly for obtaining Market Research. There will be no Question &amp; Answer period under this Sources Sought Notice.</p>
<p>General system requirements:</p>
<p>The cryostat will be in the form of a vacuum chamber that will mount on the user's optical table. Inside the vacuum chamber will be a tapped optical breadboard, with a diameter of at least 5". The vertical space available to the user should be at least 4".</p>
<p>The system must be capable of maintaining a base temperature of approximately 4.5 K or below with a heat load of 75 mW.</p>
<p>The vacuum level should be below 4 x 10-7 Torr in the sample volume.</p>
<p>Optical access to the experimental region should be provided by at least two viewports, allowing laser light to enter and exit. Electrical access to the experimental region should be provided by at least two flanges.</p>
<p>Tolerable vibration level: Acceleration level measured on the sample platform in vacuum with the cryocooler on: Below 10-4 ms-2/Hz&frac12; (10-5 g/Hz&frac12; ) in the frequency range 0.5 Hz - 20 kHz.</p>
<p>Greater experimental volume, greater tolerable heat load, lower vibration level, and convenience of use are all desirable. It is recognized that there will be tradeoffs involved in the design of such a system. It is the purpose of this sources sought notice to determine the capability to manufacture such a system.</p>
<p>Additionally, NIST is searching for systems that are capable of operating usefully in a transient regime, in which the cryocooler is shut off. It is anticipated that the temperature and pressure will rise, but with appropriate design the temperature and pressure may remain low enough that the system could function usefully in a transient mode. Various technologies could be used for this purpose, including a heat switch or a volume of liquid helium that is condensed from a cylinder and maintains the sample temperature for the time it takes to boil off and be recaptured.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the instruments that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 1000 employees or less.</p>
<p>Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture Cryostats with the above capabilities are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to Lynda.Horton@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.</p>
<p>Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided.</p>
<p>2. Name of company(s) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).</p>
<p>3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems.</p>
<p>4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to Lynda.Horton@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).</p>
<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>6. Manufacturers are requested to describe their ability to provide a system meeting these requirements, including as much information as possible concerning temperature, permissible heat load, experimental volume, vibration levels, and available options.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification<br />International Met Systems, Inc., is the only known qualified source of this regulator. All regulators for the Upper Air Program are required to be identical to the item which was provided with the original equipment. It is not possible to substitute for this item; any logistical spares must be form, fit, and function identical to the original equipment item. The original Upper Air Program equipment was subjected to a stringent qualification test regime which included operational testing, field testing, and environmental qualification testing. Acceptance of any item other than the original equipment would require that testing be completely re-accomplished. This is not acceptable, as it would require significant funding and time to accomplish and would result in fielded Upper air Program systems being unavailable during the period. If the Upper Air Program is unavailable, the mission of the National Weather Service to provide forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property would be severely hindered. For this reason, only part number 900316 available from International Met Systems, Inc., are deemed acceptable at this time.<br />Sources Sought<br />This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available.

<DESC><strong>SYNOPSIS: </strong><br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">The National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) hereby provides notice of its intent to award a sole-source, firm fixed price purchase order to <strong>Information Technology Industry Council, Inc.</strong>, 1101 K Street, NW, Suite 610, Washington, DC 20005. The order is expected to be awarded under FAR 6.302-1. A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared.<br /><br />The NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) has a requirement to renew the membership to the InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) Executive Board for the calendar year 2017 for participation in the activities of INCITS at its consensus body level, the Executive Board, and access to all of the INCITS level documents requires membership on the INCITS Executive Board. INCITS is also the US Technical Advisory Group for International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) on Information Technology. Membership on JTC 1 is restricted to National Bodies and Liaison organizations. Liaison members are required to be multinational in nature. As a United States Government (USG) agency, the only way that NIST can participate in JTC 1 is through the unique US National Body member, which is the INCITS Executive Board. The INCITS Executive Board has sole oversight of its twenty-three Technical Committees. JTC 1 has sole oversight of its twenty-four Subcommittees/Working Groups.<br /><br />Membership on the INCITS Executive Board provides the NIST ITL with an opportunity to identify issues which could impact its program of work in Information Technology (IT) standardization and testing. Without staying informed of current and future issues in this field that are being undertaken by INCITS and JTC 1, the NIST ITL's programs could be hindered, affecting the overall mission of the division. Participation in this activity also enables NIST ITL to enhance its ability to influence the timely development of national and international IT standards, which are consistent with U.S. Government and industry goals.<br /><br />INCITS is a division of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI). See: http://www.itic.org/about/divisions.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to The University of Nevada (Professor George Danko) for the purchase of services described in the statement of work using the UTHA RA thermal simulation tool model.
<p>The thermal simulation model described was developed by George Dank of the University of Nevada-Reno (UNR) using UNR's Multiflux software code. Because UNR is the owner of this code and the thermal simulation model, any modifications to the underlying code must be made by UNR. No other entities have access to the underlying software code. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within seven (7) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. Please review the below statement of work in its entirety to determine whether the requirement can be met by your company.</p>
<p>Statement of Work</p>
<p>SECTION 1</p>
<p>VENDOR will use the UHTA RA model to analyze both a 23-person tent-type RA and a 6-person rigid-type RA that were tested by NIOSH in its Experimental Mine in Bruceton, PA. VENDOR will compare the analysis results to the test results for dataset. The parameters to be compared include the internal RA temperatures, the internal RA relative humidity values, the RA surface temperatures, and the mine strata temperatures.<br />For each dataset, VENDOR will adjust the heat transfer coefficients to achieve good agreement between the model and the test results. For the purposes here, good agreement means within tolerance values of +/- 1&deg;F or +/- 2.5 %RH. These tolerance values may be adjusted at the mutual agreement of both VENDOR and NIOSH. Upon completion of all of the analyses, VENDOR will develop functions for the heat transfer coefficients, if necessary.<br />VENDOR will also modify the GUI for the model to enable the model to use constant air and/or constant surface temperature boundary conditions to facilitate comparisons with RA heat/humidity tests conducted in a high bay or temperature-controlled laboratory facility. In addition, VENDOR will modify the GUI to enable the mine roof, rib, and floor strata material properties and temperatures to be specified up to a depth of 6 ft. Note that NIOSH testing has shown that temperatures at a depth of 4 feet change by less than 1&deg;F during NIOSH in-mine RA heat and humidity tests. Six feet is specified here as a "safety factor" of sorts.</p>
<p>SECTION 2- TASKS TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>1. Match the 23-person tent-type RA test results from the Experimental Mine.<br />For each of the datasets below perform the following: collect and enter detailed RA input data regarding geometry, material properties, human model heat input, CO2 scrubber heat source, etc.; collect measured data including temperature, relative humidity, airflow velocities, and heat input; predict temperature, relative humidity, and apparent temperature over 96 hour test period and compare to measured results; adjust model to improve prediction; predict final temperature, relative humidity, and apparent temperature at end of 96 hours and compare to measured results using variations in the operating conditions of the RA; and vary model time division for increased modeling speed.</p>
<p>a. Dry test with heat input of 23 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat<br />b. Dry/wet test with heat input of 23 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat<br />c. Dry/wet test with heat input of 30 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat<br />d. Dry/wet test with heat input of 23 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat with 1500 cfm of mine ventilation flowing across the RA</p>
<p>2. Match the 6-person rigid-type RA test results from the Experimental Mine.<br />For each of the datasets below perform the following: collect and enter detailed RA input data regarding geometry, material properties, human model heat input, CO2 scrubber heat source, etc.; collect measured data including temperature, relative humidity, airflow velocities, and heat input; predict temperature, relative humidity, and apparent temperature over 96 hour test period and compare to measured results; adjust model to improve prediction; predict final temperature, relative humidity, and apparent temperature at end of 96 hours and compare to measured results using variations in the operating conditions of the RA; and vary model time division for increased modeling speed.</p>
<p>a. Dry test with heat input of 6 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat<br />b. Dry/wet test with heat input of 6 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat <br />c. Dry/wet test with heat input of 6 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat with a 25% heat increase above the "normal" heat input<br />d. Dry/wet test with heat input of 6 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat with simulated miners placed on 2-inch-thick polystyrene disks<br />3. Develop functions for heat transfer coefficients, if required.<br />4. Update UHTA model to include any modifications made to the UHTA model as part of this effort.<br />5. Modify GUI of UHTA to allow users to specify temperature boundary conditions to facilitate use of "high bay", constant-surface-temperature, or constant-air-temperature boundary conditions.</p>
<p>SECTION 3 - GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIALS</p>
<p>NIOSH will provide VENDOR with Excel spreadsheets for the following:<br />1. Experimental Mine geometry and strata properties<br />2. 23-person tent-type RA geometry and material properties<br />3. Test setup and sensor location information for in-mine 23-person tent-type RA heat/humidity tests<br />4. 23-person tent-type RA test data for dry test with heat input of 23 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat<br />5. 23-person tent-type RA test data for dry/wet test with heat input of 23 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat<br />6. 23-person tent-type RA test data for dry/wet test with heat input of 30 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat<br />7. 23-person tent-type RA test data for dry/wet test with heat input of 23 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat with 1500 cfm of mine ventilation flowing across the RA<br />8. 6-person rigid-type RA geometry and material properties<br />9. Test setup and sensor location information for in-mine 6-person rigid-type RA heat/humidity tests<br />10. 6-person rigid-type RA test data for dry test with heat input of 6 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat<br />11. 6-person rigid-type RA test data for dry/wet test with heat input of 6 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat <br />12. 6-person rigid-type RA test data for dry/wet test with heat input of 6 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat with a 25% heat increase above the "normal" heat input<br />13. 6-person rigid-type RA test data for dry/wet test with heat input of 6 miners and CO2 scrubbing system heat with simulated miners placed on 2-inch-thick polystyrene disks</p>

Submission requirements: 
Provide up to a maximum of eight (8) projects with design/services completed within the past five (5) years immediately preceding the date of issuance of this notice that best demonstrate specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas outlined above.
  Sufficient information to determine the date of completion of the project must be included in the project description or the project will not be considered.  If the project submitted was a design-bid-build (full design), then the design must be complete.  If the project was design-build, the design-build construction contract must be complete.  If more than the maximum number of projects is submitted, the Government will not evaluate projects beyond the maximum number specified in the submission requirements and projects will be evaluated in the order in which they are presented within the SF 330.  

All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and perform work under this contract.
  Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from consideration in the evaluation.  To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF 330 Part I, Section F, block 25, â€œFirm Nameâ€ Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21. Include an e-mail address and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c).  In block 24, include in the project description the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, and a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above.  If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work that firm provided towards the performance of the overall project.
  If a project was performed by a joint venture, and not all joint venture partners are on the team proposed for this contract, the firm/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract.  Likewise, if the firm/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the firm/team member proposed for this contract and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole.  If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the firm is a joint venture, projects performed by the joint venture should be submitted; however, if there are no projects performed by the joint venture, projects must be submitted for each joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of eight projects.
  Firms failing to provide projects from all joint venture partners will be considered to have not met the requirements of the criterion. 

Projects shall be submitted on the SF 330 at Part I, Section F and shall be completed projects.  Projects not completed will be excluded from evaluation consideration.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not submit an IDIQ contract as an example project.  Instead, list relevant task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above.  The Government will not evaluate information provided for an IDIQ contract.  Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.
  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being considered less qualified.

All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in the SF 330, Part I, Section F. The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part I, Section F in evaluation of Criterion 1.

Criterion 2â€”Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence (SF330, Part I, Sections E  and  G):
Firms will be evaluated on professional qualifications, competence, and experience of the proposed key personnel in providing services to accomplish the tasks required under this contract, including participation in example projects in the SF330, Part I, Section G.
 Key personnel are individuals who will have major contract or project management responsibilities and/or will provide unusual or unique expertise. Failure to provide a balanced workforce in the disciplines required to satisfy the requirements of the scope listed above will result in the firm being considered not qualified. Specific disciplines that must be included in key personnel are quality control, task order managers, project managers, and architects.   Key personnel, including sub-consultants, must be U. S. citizens and able to obtain security clearances as required.
Firms may be considered more favorably by including professional qualifications, competence, and experience, including participation in example projects, for the following disciplines: Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, Geotechnical, Cost Engineer, Lighting Designer, Landscape Architect, and Interior Design.

Evaluating past performance and experience will include information provided in Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) or CPARS/ACASS for Criterion 1 projects and may include customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criteria.
  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. 

Submission Requirements:
SUBMIT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION FOR EACH PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1.  IF A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (Attachment (A)) included in this notice is provided for the firm or its team members to submit to the client for each project the firm includes under Criterion 1, Specialized Experience.  A FIRM SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS IS AVAILABLE.
 
IF A CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.
  Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF 330.  If the firm is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, firms should complete and submit with their responses the first page of the PPQ (Attachment (A)), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Firms may submit a PPQ previously submitted under a different Notice/RFP (legible copies are acceptable) as long as it is on the same form as posted with this Synopsis.  Firms should follow up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  If requested by the client, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Governments point of contact, Abigail Ferdon, via email at abigail.ferdon@navy.mil, prior to the response date.
  Firms shall not incorporate by reference into their response PPQs or CPARS previously submitted in response to other A-E services procurements.  However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation. 

Firms may provide any information on problems encountered and the corrective actions taken on projects submitted under Criterion 1 Specialized Experience.  Firms may also address any adverse past performance issues.  Information shall not exceed two double-sided pages (or four single-sided pages) in total.

Awards, letters of commendation, certificates of appreciation, etc. shall not be submitted and will not be considered in the evaluation.

Criterion 4â€”Quality Control Program (SF 330, Part I, Section H):

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer- System for Award Management (JUL 2013)
 (a) Method of payment. 
(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term  EFT  refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
(ii) Request the Government to extend payment due dates until such time as the Government makes payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
(b) Mandatory submission of Contractor's EFT information. 
(1) The Contractor is required to provide the Government with the information required to make payment by EFT (see paragraph (j) of this clause). The Contractor shall provide this information directly to the office designated in this contract to receive that information (hereafter: ``designated office'') by the date and time specified for receipt of quotes. If not otherwise specified in this contract, the payment office is the designated office for receipt of the Contractor's EFT information. If more than one designated office is named for the contract, the Contractor shall provide a separate notice to each office. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the designated office(s).
(2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the designated office. However, EFT information supplied to a designated office shall be applicable only to contracts that identify that designated office as the office to receive EFT information for that contract.
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fed-wire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.
(d) Suspension of payment. (1) The Government is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract-financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.
(2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of this contract, the Contractor's request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days of the suspension.
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (d) shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (j) of this clause to the designated office, and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractor's financial agent.
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract.
(j) EFT information. The Contractor shall provide the following information to the designated office. The Contractor may supply this data for this or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause). The Contractor shall designate a single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing the EFT information using the EFT methods described in paragraph (c) of this clause.
(1) The contract number (or other procurement identification number).
(2) The Contractor's name and remittance address, as stated in the contract(s).
(3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this information.
(4) The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the Contractor's financial agent.
(5) The Contractor's account number and the type of account (checking, saving, or lockbox).
(6) If applicable, the Fed-wire Transfer System telegraphic abbreviation of the Contractor's financial agent.
(7) If applicable, the Contractor shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the Contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fed-wire Transfer System; and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire transfer payment.
(End of clause)

<p>We estimated we will have 700 employees that will use the coveralls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We asked the sections how many coveralls they require and that is how we came up with the 700.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone works a 5 day work<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;<br />(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;<br />(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and<br />(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;<br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The Dominican Republic (DR) is the largest economy in the Caribbean and shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.&nbsp; The 11.5 million inhabitants of the DR include nearly 500,000 Haitians, and the two countries are major trading partners.&nbsp; Despite its classification as a middle-income country, 41 percent of the DR's population lives in poverty.&nbsp; Major development challenges include a high incidence of violent crime and narcotics trafficking, vulnerability to climate change, weak institutions, poor education, and lack of job opportunities for youth.&nbsp; Vulnerable groups, such as women, people with disabilities, people of Haitian descent, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, are often subject to discrimination. The Dominican Republic ranks 140 out of 148 countries for quality of the educational system and is the 11th most vulnerable country in the world to climate change. Transparency International ranks the Dominican Republic as in the 22nd percentile for corruption and 25th percentile for rule of law, demonstrating a high level of corruption and violence.</span></p>

Vocational training and job placement services are also provided, as well as assistance in obtaining the identification documents that are required to study and work.&nbsp;USAID also focuses on improving the quality of education, by strengthening the ability of students in the early grades to read and develop other basic skills. USAID assists entities like the police, prosecutors, judges, and civil society organizations, to improve law enforcement&rsquo;s effectiveness in fighting crime.&nbsp;</span></p>

These planning efforts will be complemented by strengthening the capacity of local governments to gather, manage, and use climate information and the implementation of on-the ground adaptation measures. In addition, USAID is promoting an index-based insurance system for dairy livestock producers and implementing a regional marine biodiversity conservation program.&nbsp;</span></p>

USAID&rsquo;s efforts are focused on the development of community and facility-based service delivery models that provide quality health services for key populations with the highest HIV prevalence. These include female sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgendered individuals and undocumented Dominicans of Haitian descent. Through improved case finding, quality clinical services, community-based support combined with focused efforts to improve supply chain management and human resources for health, USAID expects to establish models in the public sector that can be transferred for national scale-up.</span></p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Pakistan Team Leader is a member of the USAID Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Chief of FPD, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division: Africa (AFR), Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), Pakistan (PAK), Middle East (ME), and Europe and Asia (EA). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>Under this solicitation, the Regional Team Leader will be responsible for overseeing specific OTI country programs in Pakistan, supervising program teams in Washington, DC and the field, and serving as the principle OTI interlocutor on all existing and forecasted programs in the region. This is a program-funded USPSC position that focuses the vast majority of its time on managing country programs. The Pakistan Team Leader will insure that U.S. Government funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practices and U.S. Government policy.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Regional Team Leader requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of programs, funds and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Regional Team Leader is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.</p>

<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Pakistan Team Leader is a member of the USAID Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Chief of FPD, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division: Africa (AFR), Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), Pakistan (PAK), Middle East (ME), and Europe and Asia (EA). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>Under this solicitation, the Regional Team Leader will be responsible for overseeing specific OTI country programs in Pakistan, supervising program teams in Washington, DC and the field, and serving as the principle OTI interlocutor on all existing and forecasted programs in the region. This is a program-funded USPSC position that focuses the vast majority of its time on managing country programs. The Pakistan Team Leader will insure that U.S. Government funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practices and U.S. Government policy.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Regional Team Leader requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of programs, funds and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Regional Team Leader is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.</p>

Ensure that employee performance evaluations are completed in a timely manner in accordance with OTI office policy;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise the implementation of OTI-financed activities, including overseeing and/or managing the selection of program implementers such as grantees, contractors, and Personal Services Contract employees;</p>

The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The DLA Troop Support intends to solicit for a full-line of produce support for DoD, Non-DoD (USDA School), and Reservation customers located in the State of Mississippi. This is a 100% Small Business Set Aside acquisition. The total length of the contract will be five (5.0) years. It contains One (24 month) and two (18 month) tier periods.
<p><br />Its estimated maximum dollar amount is $35,000,000.00. The delivery points require indefinite quantities of Fresh Fruit and Vegetables throughout the term of the contract. A more detailed listing of the delivery sites can be found in the solicitation. All responsible sources may submit proposals that will be considered by DLA Troop Support.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract(s) resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer(s) conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures will be used as the source selection method in this procurement. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Acceptability - A technically acceptable offer is an offer that takes no exceptions to the terms and conditions in the solicitation and complies fully with all submission requirements, including submissions relating to the two sub-factors listed below. A proposal that is deemed technically unacceptable may be removed by the Contracting Officer from further consideration for the award. By submitting a proposal with no exceptions, an offeror is confirming it possesses the necessary facilities, equipment, technical skills and capacity to successfully provide all items required by this solicitation. The following sub-factors will be evaluated and must be found acceptable for a proposal to be eligible for award:</p>
<p>A. Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) License - The offeror shall possess and submit proof of a valid current PACA license. The submitted PACA license must be effective for at least six (6) months after the solicitation closing date.</p>
<p>B. USDA Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Good Handling Practices (GHP) Audit - The offeror shall submit a GAP/GHP audit report for each place of performance identified in the offeror's proposal. The audit report(s) must demonstrate that a passing score(s) was/were received and the report(s) must be dated no more than six (6) months prior to the solicitation closing date.</p>
<p>2. Pricing - Pricing is required for all items found in the Schedule of Items (for each Group, if applicable) and for all tiers. Failure to offer pricing for all items and for all tiers may result in a proposal being removed from consideration for award as technically unacceptable. The Government will perform an aggregate price analysis on all items found in the Schedule of Items (for each Group, if applicable). To determine an offeror's evaluated aggregate price, the Contracting Officer will add an offeror's Weighted Aggregate Distribution Price (1) together with its Aggregate Delivered Price (2). The addition of these two pricing components equals the Evaluated Aggregate Price (3).&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p>The objective of this procurement is to establish a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with companies that specialize in providing professional services in the fields of program management, project management, construction management, real property management, lease administration management, workplace management, facilities management, project controls management, material handling systems consultation, technical writing, project analysis, cost estimating, project scheduling, construction inspection, computer aided design and drafting, and management and program analysis support services. In addition to general professional services, additional services may include project management oversight, design reviews, integrated technology coordination, security coordination, budget review, change order management, subject matter expertise for the Automated Storage Retrieval System (ASRS), real estate and leasing.</p>
<p>The FBI intends to establish IDIQ contracts with those vendors experienced in professional support services. The FBI will compete task orders, under this IDIQ, among the companies selected in this procurement for the support services covering existing program requirements as well as new capability requirements as identified. To be selected as an awardee of the IDIQ contract, an Offeror must demonstrate their company's ability to deliver the specified services for one or more of the specified seed task order service areas.</p>
<p>This multiple award IDIQ Contract for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for Professional Support Services will serve various sites including:</p>
<p>&bull; Washington D.C. Metropolitan area <br />&bull; Quantico, Virginia<br />&bull; Pocatello, Idaho <br />&bull; Huntsville, Alabama<br />&bull; Clarksburg, West Virginia<br />&bull; Other United States Locations<br />&bull; OCONUS Locations (as needed)</p>
<p>The Multiple Award IDIQ will consist of at least three prime contractors and have a programmatic capacity of $150M. The FBI anticipates the future task orders will be Firm-Fixed Price Level-of-Effort (IAW FAR 16.207) and Cost Reimbursable (for travel, material and insurance if required). The anticipated period of performance will be a base year with four annual options. The solicitation will also request pricing for an additional six-month option after the fourth annual option. The total duration of the IDIQ shall not exceed 66 months. Task order period of performance can exceed the base contract period of performance depending on the timing of award of the task order. The programmatic capacity is for the entire period of performance and financial capacity not expended will not be lost, but shall be extended out to the option years.</p>
<p>Part 1 Proposal Submission - Due to the sensitive nature of this acquisition and the need for an active "Top Secret" DSS Facility Clearance, the proposal submission process will be conducted in two-parts. Part 1 will be the proposal submission of Volume 1, Security. See Section L-3 for the Security requirements. Offerors who submit Volume 1, Security and receive a "Pass" rating will be the only contractors issued all attachments for this RFP, no exceptions. The Seed Task Orders may contain sensitive information regarding FBI projects, drawings, plans and staffing levels that may comprise FBI security. Therefore, the Security factor is the basis for this two-part proposal submission process. Part 1 is due to the FBI by January 6, 2017 AT 12:00 NOON EASTERN STANDARD TIME (EST). Volume 1 shall be e-mailed to the CO, David Triplett at David.Triplett@ic.fbi.gov and Mark Dillinger at Mark.Dillinger@ic.fbi.gov.</p>

<DESC><br />Pre-Solicitation Notice<br />FY17 Georgia (Country) MATOC

<p>The use of the MATOC will provide the Government with a construction product delivery method that can accommodate quick and straight-forward projects, as well as some small but complex projects, and can help minimize design effort and related overhead expenditures, as well as handle compressed schedules. The Government will evaluate and select, for contract award, two (2) to five (5) qualified Offerors, whose Proposals are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with consideration given to both the technical evaluation factors and price.</p>
<p>Task Orders will primarily address new construction, design-build or design-bid-build, general building renovation, road and airfield pavement repair, utility work to include water, sewer, electrical, and gas, and general environmental work including, but not limited to, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical, concrete work, and environmental remedial work. This solicitation will cover the geographical area of Georgia (country).</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, a two-phase source selection process will be used to evaluate the contractors for award. Those contractors who are considered most qualified during Phase I (not to exceed five (5) contractors) will be requested to submit the proposal requirements for Phase II. Specific evaluation criteria will be provided in the solicitation documents.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of the MATOC is not-to-exceed US$30,000,000.00 for the life of the contract, which will consist of a base period of three (3) years and two (2) one(1)-year option periods. The Contract will end upon completion of the five (5) years (if all options are exercised) or upon attainment of the US$30,000,000.00 capacity. Individual projects issued under the MATOC will contain their own estimated values. There will be no limits on the number of task orders awarded/issued in any year. The minimum guarantee shall be $5,000.00. This amount shall cover the duration of the entire contract (Base Period and Option Periods).</p>
<p>The Corps of Engineers, Europe District intends to advertise the solicitation for this MATOC on or about 28 Dec 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Offeror wishes to perform some of the work using subcontractors (subject to the 25% prime contractor work requirement stated in FAR 52.236-1, Performance of Work by the Contractor), the prime contractor may use subcontractors of any nationality providing they submit commitment letters from those subcontractors. The contractor may not change subcontractors without the Contracting Officer's approval. Approval will not be given unless the contracting officer, in the exercise of his/her sole discretion, considers the proposed substitute to be equal in all respects to the originally proposed subcontractor and the contracting officer considers the substitution to be in the best interests of the Government.</p>
<p><br />The USACE Europe District Contracting Office will be the sole point of contact for this solicitation. The Primary Points of Contact for this solicitation will be as follows:</p>

<DESC>Notice Information:<br />This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information only. The submission of this information is for planning purposes only. This is not a Solicitation Announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal. This request does not obligate the government to make a contract award. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District, is conducting preliminary research to determine the market capabilities of potential contractors to support the design and construction of a Troop Medical Clinic at Ft. Gordon, GA. This market research will facilitate a determination of the acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government will determine the acquisition type based on the market research and information available from other sources. The market survey is being conducted to determine if there are a reasonable number of large or small business firms interested in performing this work (including socio economic businesses). Small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses are encouraged to respond. Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate decisions.
<p><br />The NAICS code for this acquisition is 236220 Commercial &amp; Institutional Building Construction with a size standard of $36.5M. The FSC Code is Y1DB - Construction of Laboratories &amp; Clinics. The duration of the design-build construction project will be approximately 18 months and will include design and construction periods. Fast track construction may be allowed whereby site-work, utility work, and foundation work may begin before final design completion. The construction will include a base item for the Medical Clinic, and will include optional items for additional building square footage and parking spaces.</p>
<p>Project Description:<br />The design-build contractor shall design and construct a new medical clinic. The scope of the medical clinic building is approximately 58,600 GSF plus supporting facilities including utilities, site improvements, and 340 parking spaces for patients and staff. The project is needed to expand treatment capabilities and consolidate functions currently in various facilities to provide convenient and efficient care to approximately 18,600 Active Duty (AD) soldiers and Advanced Individual Training (AIT) students in one location. The Consolidated Troop Medical Clinic (CTMC) will provide the following services:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Primary Care (Soldier Centered Medical Home)<br />b.&nbsp; Hearing Conservation<br />c.&nbsp; Radiology<br />d.&nbsp; Laboratory<br />e.&nbsp; Pharmacy<br />f.&nbsp; Patient Administration<br />g.&nbsp; Behavioral Health Clinic<br />h.&nbsp; Optometry<br />I.&nbsp; Physical Therapy</p>
<p>Base and Optional Items of Work:<br />The base work will consist of a new clinic of approximately 49,200 GSF with an optional item of work for approximately 9,400 additional GSF. The option will add three (3) Soldier Centered Medical Home (SCHM) primary care teams. The base work will also include approximately 240 parking spaces with an option for 100 additional parking spaces.</p>
<p>Construction Cost Limitation (CCL):<br />The project will have a CCL of approximately $22,375,000 which includes both design and construction efforts.</p>
<p>Design Approach:<br />The Design-Build contractor is encouraged to be innovative in proposing measurable design and construction solutions that meet or exceed the mandatory requirements established by the government in the Request for Proposal, while considering cost effectiveness and overall benefit to the environment of medical care.</p>
<p>Site Work:<br />There are no existing structures above grade on the CTMC site that require demolition. However, the existing site includes pavement remnants, underground utilities, and possibly foundations from previous development that will require preparatory demolition work prior to construction of the new facility.</p>
<p>Sustainability:<br />The project shall be designed to incorporate sustainable features and products as required by Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 1-200-02 High Performance and Sustainable Building Requirements and for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) accreditation, when determined to be economically feasible and meeting the technical requirements of the Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS). The goal for the design of the CTMC shall be the attainment of LEED Silver rating as defined by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED Green Building Rating System for New Construction and Major Renovations Version 2009, or LEED for Healthcare, as determined to be the most appropriate by the Design-Build/Designer of Record (DB/DOR) team. The DB Contractor shall be responsible for finalizing the sustainable design and construction and achieving a formal certification by the USGBC.</p>
<p>Standards:<br />In addition to meeting the requirements of the Government solicitation, the project shall be designed in accordance with the criteria prescribed in UFC 4-510-01 Design: Military Medical Facilities which can be found at the Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG) website: <br />http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/browse_cat.php?o=29&amp;c=4</p>
<p>Antiterrorism Force Protection:<br />Design and construction of the CTMC shall meet the latest edition of UFC 4-010-01 DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings. In the determination of Antiterrorism Force Protection (ATFP) design requirements, the CTMC is categorized as a Primary Gathering Facility, based on the understanding that it will be routinely occupied by more than 50 personnel.</p>
<p>Equipment:<br />The DB Contractor shall provide certain contractor-furnished, contractor-installed (CFCI) equipment. The DB Contractor shall coordinate with the Government on Government-furnished, Government-installed (GFGI) equipment requirements and provide suitable structural supports, wall backing, all utility connections, and space with the required clearances for all equipment identified. Detailed equipment and furniture requirements shall be developed during iterative design after award.</p>
<p>Commissioning:<br />Total Building Commissioning (TBCx) shall as a minimum include the tasks required by the LEED enhanced commissioning credit and the requirements of the government solicitation. TBCx shall be executed during all project phases, including the design, construction, and post-construction/warranty phases. TBCx shall verify that building systems perform interactively according to the intent of the design and that the systems meet the operational needs.</p>
<p>There will be no reimbursement costs associated with providing information in response to this request<br />nor any requests for follow-up information.</p>

<DESC>Chapter VI: Other Than Full and Open Competition (OFOC) SOP
Attachment 4:  Single Source Justification for SAP under $150K

OFOC SOP Revision 05   Page 1 of 1
Original Date: 03/22/11
Revision 05 Date: 05/02/2016
JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
VA250-17-AP-3105

1A. PROJECT/TASK No.  N/A
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT:
$30,000 
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
Purchase of Heart Valve for the Trans-catheter approach for Heart Valve Replacement

Need Date: December 30, 2016

Medtronic, Inc., 710 Medtronic Pkwy, Minneapolis MN 55432

UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED: 

Of the two manufacturers that produce valves for trans-catheter approach heart valve replacement, only Medtronic s valve has these needed features. This valve is repositionable if necessary during procedure. Is designed for the 1st time positioning accuracy with the assurance to recapture and reposition. Has the lowest delivery profile across all valve sizes through a 14FR equivalent system, and is now indicated for minimum vessel diameters  5.0mm. Provides exceptional valve performance and reduced significant PVL

DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED: 
There are only two manufacturers of products for this Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) Edwards Lifescience and Medtronic. There are variances in the products which met the needs of specific criteria of individual patients being treated. This VA stocks both manufacturers  products to provide the necessary products based on the individual patient. This request is to replace specific products that were used. The physician has chosen the particular heart valve being ordered during his consult and determined this is the only one deemed appropriate for use in this specific medical situation.

5. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.
