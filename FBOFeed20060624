The goal of this RFI is to determine your company’s current capabilities to meet some or all of the challenging demands for the SIM Project.  Being space qualified is NOT a requirement at this time. SCOPE OF WORK - This document specifies performance requirements for space qualified micron displacement sensors with sub-nanometer resolution in support of the SIM Planet Finder mission, as a part of NASA’s continuing Origin Program. KEY REQUIREMENTS - The performance requirements for the sensors that are expected to be procured are generally described below. Specific applications for the three (3) types of sensors will be enveloped by the requirement ranges described below.  Being space qualified is NOT a requirement at this time. The contractor should provide the range and tolerances for each of the parameters. Sensor parameters (requirements) will fall in the ranges specified as: (a) Displacement ranges between 1.5 to 15 microns; (b) Measurement accuracy (after linearization) of 0.5 nm; (c) Resolution 0.075 nm  to 0.2 nm; and (d) Bandwidth &lt;10 Hz or up to 1 kHz RESPONSES - All responses to the RFI are due no later than July 10, 2006 to JPL, Attention: Steve Woo, M/S 201-203, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109-8099.

Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the Clinical Infectious Disease  Journal (CID) being an official publication of the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) – the most creditable and respected scientific body involved in the development, discussion and dissemination of policies and research findings related to the prevention and control of infectious diseases.  CID is the most widely respected and read publication of its kind in the world and the CDC wisshes to maximize on this investment by ensuring the most efficacy regarding dissemination. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide the training and access to appropriate environmental health professionals in both public and private sectors are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days of the publication date of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquires may be sent to Gary Morgan by email at glm1@CDC.gov or by fax to 770-488-2777.
