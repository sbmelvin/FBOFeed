<DESC>SYNOPSIS 

Subject: Kuwait Air Force Simulated Aircraft Maintenance Trainers (SAMTs) and Naval Air Maintenance Trainers (NAMTs)

Description:  

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Command intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a small purchase order with SimTech Services Corp, Winter Park, FL under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".

The Kuwaiti government is currently using SAMT Devices KU 11H102, 11H103, 11H104, 11H105 and 11H106, as well, as NAMT devices 74D090035-1005 and 74D090033-1005 for maintenance training support for the FA-18 Aircraft.   These devices are currently in an unknown operating status and the Kuwaiti Government has requested a site assessment of the condition of the devices as well as a determination of the effort required to restore and update the trainer to be compatible with the -19C Operational Flight Program (OFP) aircraft configuration.  The original manufacturer of these trainers is no longer providing support for these devices; however; the founder of SimTech was a significant contributor to the development of the initial systems.  SimTech personnel have in-depth knowledge of the training devices and the requisite engineering expertise to conduct an evaluation and provide a report on their findings.  There will be no documentation or technical support provided by the Government in support of this effort; therefore, an in-depth knowledge of the systems is required.  Additionally, the Kuwaiti government has approved a site visit window of 16 ? 20 June 2007 to facilitate the survey.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, and any other information, which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Erin Barton at erin.barton@navy.mil that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than 17 May 2007.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than two (2) pages.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

"	Proposed Issue Date:  May 25, 2007 "	Title of Project:  Northwest Arctic Heritage Center Description:  The work of this contract includes two discreet components, including the construction of the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center and the Maintenance building in Kotzebue, Alaska.  Previous work already contracted included the demolition of the existing facilities on administrative land owned by the National Park Service; preparation of the finish sub grade of both building sites; installation of new water, sewer, and storm culvert pipe on both sites; and installation of thermosyphons and thermopiles per proposed building foundation design for both facilities.  Work that is not a part of this contract includes exhibit fabrication/installation and audiovisual hardware installation in the multi-purpose room.  Proper coordination to accommodate the work not included in this contract is required.  Northwest Arctic Heritage Center:  The work comprises erection of structural members upon the existing thermopile system, enclosure of the building, installation of finishes, utility connections extending from stubs previously installed, and furnishing equipment and other permanent appurtenances.  Placement of loads upon any of the piles shall not begin until confirmation has been made by the National Park Service geotechnical consultants that subsurface conditions are stable, permafrost soils are present, and piles are ready.  The multi-purpose facility previously decommissioned and demolished may have had building materials, providing they met qualitative standards, which are designated and available for re-use in the new construction.  The remaining site work includes finish grading, traffic way surfacing, installation of site furnishings, and landscaping.  Maintenance Building:  The work comprises excavation of the existing foundation pad, placement of concrete foundation, erection of structural members, enclosure of the building, installation of finishes, utility connections extending from stubs and manholes previously installed, and furnishing equipment and other permanent appurtenances.  Placement of loads upon the foundation pad shall not begin until confirmation has been made by the National Park Service geotechnical consultants that subsurface conditions are stable and the thermosyphon system is functioning as intended.  The remaining site work includes finish grading and installation of site furnishings. "	Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price. "	Estimated price range, $5,000,000.00 to $8,000,000.00. "	Time for completion by June 1, 2009.  "	Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available. "	All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.  "	It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories.  "	In order to be considered for award, all large businesses will be required to submit an acceptable Small, HUBZone Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-owned, Veteran-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan with their proposal.   The NPS subcontracting goals for Fiscal Year 2007 for the participation of small businesses at a minimum are as follows:  Small Business Concerns - 19%; Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns - 3%; Small Women-Owned Business Concerns - 5%; HUBZone Small Business Concerns - 3%; Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns - 3%; Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Concerns - 3%; 8(a) concerns - 2.5%.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure services on a sole source basis, with Ms. Waltraud Mueller, Dr. Enders Street 5 Pfreimd, Germany 92536, regarding: Correlative fluorescence and x-ray and cryo-electron-tomography of transcriptionally active chromatin.

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106. 

The purpose of this procurement is to acquire the services of a biologist to perform correlative fluorescence and high resolution microscopy.  Specifically, the services entailed are: 1) acquire images of transcriptionally active chromatin by fluorescence microscopy; 2) find the same region in the same cell and with the help of our collaborators in Germany; 3) image it again with one of two higher resolution techniques: cryo-x-ray tomography and cryo-electron tomography.  These studies will ultimately provide the first high-resolution images of a transcriptionally active site, enabling us to better understand how transcription occurs.

Ms. Waltraud Mueller is a research biologist expert in the field of molecular and cellular biology, who pioneered the fluorescence microscopy techniques required for imaging transcriptionally active chromatin.  The specific engineered cell line under this study is unique to the research being performed in the NCI.  Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the current research being performed at the NCI. Ms. Mueller is the only source known to the NCI that has used this cell line to study chromatin structure.   

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM ET May 17, 2007.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please reference solicitation number NCI-70052-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground, Yuma, AZ has a requirement for a Real-Time Wireless Sound Location, Classification and Scoring System to locate, count and classify multiple, simultaneous, atmospheric acoustic events produced by military ordnance d uring testing at volumetric impact fields.  This system shall serve users in numerous geographic locations, all environments, all weather and all light conditions.  The system must have the capability to operate on DC battery power for all instrumentation inside the volumetric impact field and on generator power for all instrumentation within the base station.  All instrumentation must have minimum noise emissions, especially inside the volumetric impact field.  The system must operate over a range of 20 Km  from the base station to the center of the covered volume.  Volumetric impact fields do not have utilities, improvements or roads.  All volumetric impact field based instrumentation must endure exposure to natural environmental conditions 100 percent of t he time during testing.  Most base station instrumentation must mount on standard 19 instrumentation racks inside of an environmental controlled shelter.  The system must collect and store acoustical atmospheric events for 48 hours nonstop.  During all th is time, the system must display the real-time data being collected, process the data being collected and display the results of the processed data on multiple remote monitors.  The system central time must be referenced to coordinated universal time (UTC)  time.  The system must collect and utilize real -time atmospheric conditions, (temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction and ambient pressure), over the covered volume.  The wireless communications must be faultless and not susceptible to interfer ence or cause interference with other systems.  The system must be ready for Fast Ethernet networks.  The system CPU must be state of the art.  The operating system must be MS Windows, as recommended by Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) at the time of contract awa rd. The current recommendation is the XP Professional version.  The system software license and code must be included, with no limitations.  The system must be capable of performing self-diagnostic tests to verify status of all components.  For data archiv ing, the system must provide a hardware controller raid apparatus.  For surveying the location of the acoustic sensors, the system must provide real-time GPS surveying grade instrumentation.  The system must be capable of locating events in space, as well as on the surface of leveled and unleveled terrain.  The system must classify events by acoustic signatures and keep a separate count for each type of atmospheric acoustic signature event.  The system must account for simultaneous atmospheric acoustic even ts in the air, ground surface and air and ground surface combination.  Each atmospheric acoustic event must have its time of day reported and corrected to the local geographical location time zone.  Each atmospheric acoustic event must have its location co ordinates (X, Y, Z) resolved and corrected to the local geographical location coordinate system.  The system must post process data.  At the post processing time, the user must be capable of correcting the atmospherics conditions if necessary.  In addition , the user must be capable of selecting specific atmospheric acoustical event(s) for post processing single and multiple solutions.  All exterior components of the system must be rugged for use in arctic, desert and tropical test environments and high wind s.  The whole system must resist exposures to peak blast overpressures from high explosives at the base station and within the volumetric impact field.  The system must work during bright and obscure light conditions.  This acquisition is a 100% Small Busi ness Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334511 with a size standard of 750 employees.

This lodging project is similar in nature to a dormitory or hotel complex and is intended to provide temporary lodging for a) military  airmen and their families awaiting available permanent residences on base, or b) those that have vacated their residences and are in preparing to relocate to their next assignment. The majority of military installations world-wide have similar motel/hotel  projects in use. The proposed Mountain Home lodging project to be constructed is uniquely situated on a blank site within the center of the base, and within walking distance to nearby housing neighborhoods, schools, and community activity centers.  It is also within easy commute of all on base activities and offices. The proposed Government solicitation will publish a fully designed project that reflects and represents Air Force and Corps of Engineers criteria while enhancing the architectural and environm ental character of the surrounding community. Proposed constructed features of this family friendly extended stay motel or lodging project consist of 1) separate attached building modules in a residential neighborhood setting on a vacant site, resulting in  a total of 35 individual living units, with housekeeping spaces, mechanical rooms and other functional and operational spaces for a total approximate area of 55,000 square feet; and 2) exterior amenities on a prepared site to support the project include s ite utilities, landscaping, roadways and sidewalks, centralized parking, special delivery area and emergency vehicle access, circulation path and tot lot playground. An architectural concept sketch of the proposed building and other project design informat ion is available for viewing under this web site https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/solicitation_view.cfm?psolicitationnbr=W912DW07R0035. The awarded contractor will also be required to 3) Provide operation and maintenance manuals, as-built drawings and equ ipment lists.

<DESC>This notice is to announce that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Sanctuary, Honolulu, Hawaii has a requirement for a firm fixed price contract for the Discovery Center Greeting Station, Exhibit Refurbishing, and Storage Creation.

Scope of Work

Greeting Station:  Daily operations of the facility, greeting of visitors, and fielding of most questions from visitors are currently handled by a staff of docents.  As the facility is constructed now, there is not an adequate or obvious place for docents to sit, and be best positioned to greet visitors, store their bags, and do other work as needed, such as computer work.  The installation of an enclosed greeting station in the front entryway would also serve as additional space for displaying a welcome exhibit panel, house a secured computer and a workspace to provide informational materials.  

Storage:  Install storage space in the program room and behind the aquarium. Design the top of the storage units in the program room as an exhibit space for small three dimensional objects. 

?	Provide and install kitchen area hanging cabinets over counter space to store aquarium supplies.  Two wall spaces, one is 8? across, the other 6.5? across.  The two walls meet, but form an acute angle.  Ceilings are 8? high.  Storage must be at least 1? deep.
?	Provide and install aquarium room storage hanging unit to store aquarium supplies.  One hanging unit will be 8? in length, and approximately 2? tall.  The other is 6? in length, and can be up to 4? in height.  Storage must be at least 1? deep.
?	Provide and install program room custom locking storage along walls under existing panels and screen to store 12 6? folding tables and educational materials.  The six or more storage units will be approximately 18? in depth, and 3? in height.   Top of storage usable as exhibit space for small three dimensional objects and graphics, and have clear acrylic tops.  The top of the cases will be sloping.  They will be designed to compliment the existing displays and cabinetry.  

Lighting:  Highlight the new exhibit cases in the program room in order to enhance the current exhibits that are located in that room. Lighting should highlight specific parts of the room and also be flexible enough for the multipurpose aspects of the room.  In addition, install three additional electrical outlets behind our 2,500 gallon aquarium to better make use of the space and avoid the occasional need of extension cords in public areas.

The government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice. A firm fixed price purchase order will be issued with performance period of one year from date of award. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206)526-6025, attention Melvin N. Fondue. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.00


Mandatory Clause:     The Western Administrative Support Center, Acquisition Management Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this acquisition office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) before contract award.     NO award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR.     For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site:     http:///www.ccr.gov/.     In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number.

<DESC>Description:  Note as of 3 May 2007 the name associated with this acquisition has been modified from "Mobile Ground Entry Point Service (MOGEPS)" to "Transportable Communications (T-Comm) Service."  This modification is necessary to alleviate confusion with a similar name for another acquisition, and to meet other customer needs.  The service requirement itself is not changed in any respect.

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), located at Scott Air Force Base, IL intends to award a sole-source contract to AT&T Corp. for MObile Ground Entry Point Service (MOGEPS).  MOGEPS is a specialized telecommunications service needed to continue similar service previously delivered by AT&T Corp. under contract DCA200-95-C-0080.  The purpose of MOGEPS is to provide air-to-ground communications capability to certain suitably equipped aircraft performing special missions anywhere in the world.  Examples of aircraft supported are E-4B National Airborne Operations Center aircraft, E-6B Airborne National Command Post Aircraft, Air Force One, and other Air Force and Navy aircraft operating in support of the National Command Authority and National Military Command System.  MOGEPS will extend the reach of the U.S. Air Force Northstar Network to these aircraft as they occasionally operate in areas not served by Northstar.  To provide this service the contractor shall maintain two teams of personnel and portable equipment ready at all times to travel to required service locations on a minimum of twenty four hours notice.  The contractor shall provide full duplex, 15 channel, voice and data communications service over a T-1 circuit path.  The MOGEPS equipment shall link with an airborne aircraft via Ultra High Frequency radio utilizing military frequencies, or via physical connection when an aircraft is on the ground.  Within the Continental U.S., MOGEPS shall normally link to Northstar via use of a terrestrial circuit, which will be provided by the Government.  Outside the Continental U.S., the link to Northstar will normally be via a contractor arranged Ku, C, or X band satellite link back to the U.S.  MOGEPS equipment must be compatible with the legacy terminal equipment aboard the aircraft served, as the Government is not in a position to replace existing aircraft terminals to be compatible with new design MOGEPS equipment using different technology.  The aircraft terminals currently in use are based upon customized military equipment no longer manufactured, combined  in unique equipment configurations, using custom telecommunications software, and producing signals with unique technical  parameters.  There are no acceptable commercial substitutes for the equipment and software in use.  Performance of this contract requires access to classified telecommunications information.  MOGEPS team members must as a minimum have a secret security clearance.  No subcontracting opportunities are expected for this contract.  All inquiries regarding the procurement solicitation should be submitted electronically to Mr. Stan Schellenbach, Contract Specialist, e-mail stan.schellenbach@disa.mil, or Ms Lisa A. Boeckmann, Contracting Officer, e-mail lisa.boeckmann@disa.mil, no later than 14 May 2007.  NAICS Code 517110 is applicable to this acquisition.

<DESC>CORRECTION:  This action published in the FBO on 20 April 2007 is amended as follows:

In the first paragraph under "Description" delete the second through the fifth sentences and replace with the following:


The primary purpose is to conduct subsurface investigations with subsequent geotechnical/foundation analysis- including monitoring, sampling and analysis of soil and groundwater for geotechnical properties and environmental contamination using various field and laboratory tests and construction or materials testing and engineering inspection  services.  On occasion, engineering services involving consultation on, or the inspection and evaluation of materials or site conditions during the design, the construction, or after construction (such as slope stability analysis, earthwork-related site improvements, foundations, concrete and bituminous pavements, etc.) will be required.  The general intention is to provide for such engineering services as necessary to support the construction and maintenance of facilities.  For the Government to retain maximum flexibility in the interest of their clients, various services/products, such as the preparation of technical reports, studies, engineering investigations, wetland delineation and mapping, cost estimates, surveys (property, topographic, hydrographic, etc.), shop drawing reviews, construction related consultation and inspection may be required.  Typically consultant?s office or field travel time will be no greater than 7 days on a specific task order.  Materials engineering consultation and inspection services will be negotiated on an as-needed basis and need not be by in-house consultants.


At the beginning of the paragraph following the listing of Laboratory Accreditation Authorities insert - "1.  ".

All other information remains unchanged.

Description
In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997), this is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of response to this Sources Sought announcement. All responsible sources may respond, in the form of a capability statement, to this sources sought notice. All such responses will be considered.  
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (with Capabilities Requirement)
1.0	Background:  The LVCAR study is sponsored by the Modeling and Simulation Steering Committee (M&S SC).  The study will explore and assess simulation interoperability alternatives across three broad areas of concern:  notional definition of the desired future architecture standard(s), the desired business model(s), and the manner in which standards should be evolved and compliance evaluated.  The roadmap will provide rationale for these recommendations, assess user community reception of any proposed LVC architecture policy changes, and recommend next steps (e.g., prototyping any new architecture).

2.0	Description of Request:  This Sources Sought Request is to inform and determine availability of potential sources capable of participating as members of and providing relevant market information to the LVCAR Working Group (WG).  The success of the LVCAR study depends on the precision, robustness, and clarity of stated LVC requirements and a representative ensemble of use cases.  To achieve this, participation from the COCOMs, Services, Agencies and other Communities of Interest, to include industry, in a WG chaired by USJFCOM J7, is desired.  

2.1 WG Members Roles and Responsibilities:  The WG interfaces with the LVCAR study in two ways:  

a.	Provides input in support of the development of products
b.	Reviews and provide feedback on theses products, and subsequent findings and recommendations

Thus, the WG should be comprised of representatives that can support both of these functions.  Specifically, WG members should have knowledge of and access to their respective LVC user communities, and they should have sufficient technical expertise to judge the subsequent findings as well as the necessary influence to represent their constituency?s response to those findings.  Given that the LVCAR study focuses on three dimensions of LVC interoperability issues (i.e., architecture, business model, standards development processes), the WG members should be able to collect information (e.g., requirements, use case information, etc.) and represent their constituency across all these dimensions.  Tasks executed by the WG members will include information collection and distribution, attendance at meetings, facilitating communication among the study support team and WG member?s constituency, product reviews, soliciting and providing feedback, etc.  It is anticipated that some constituencies will have multiple representatives assigned to the WG.

2.2 Level of Effort (LOE) and Travel Requirements:  For the WG members it is anticipated that no more than a 10% LOE, based on every other month to quarterly WG meetings over a 15 month period, is required to sufficiently support this project.  The first WG meeting is mid-Jul 2007.  Members should also anticipate periodic teleconferences for status updates.  Any indirect level of effort required for data collection and formal staffing within a constituency is better estimated by the individual constituency.  Embedded in the direct WG membership LOE estimate is the assumption that the WG member?s respective constituent community will respond to requests for information and product review.  Members can anticipate no more than two travel days per quarter over the projected 15 month study period.  WG meetings will be in Northern Virginia, Suffolk, and Orlando.  The LVCAR study is not funded to reimburse WG members for their time and travel associated with this effort.
2.3 Capability Statement:  An interested party?s capability statement must demonstrate requisite experience with LVC architectures and an ability to participate as a WG member or as an information provider to the WG.   Responses/capability statements provided as a result of this notice shall be evaluated by the study managers and approved by the sponsor.  The following information should be included:  
a.	A summary of the party?s relevant current and prior work
b.	An assigned point-of-contact (name, address, phone number, email address) to respond to further information requests on behalf of the M&S SC.
c.	An indication of interest to become a member of the LVCAR WG or an interest in providing information / support to the LVCAR WG on an as requested basis.
d.	A one page corporate summary, including the interested party?s web site.

3.0 Data Rights:  All products (documentation, reports, etc.) and technical data developed and compiled for the LVCAR study shall become the property of the Government with unlimited Government use rights in the absence of any assertion of restrictive rights.  The WG team members shall be required to sign non-disclosure statements, to ensure integrity of sensitive information and findings.  Recommendations and findings from the study will be For Official Government Use Only (FOUO) and shall not be divulged prior to official release by the Government.

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought/RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and neither constitutes a Request For Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the question:  Will these invoices be Purchase Order (PO) or non-PO based?

Answer ? The invoices will be both PO and non-PO based.  

The Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center (ARC), is assessing the market to gain information on commercial off-the-shelf invoicing routing and approval system requirements. The ARC serves as a Shared Service Provider offering administrative services to other federal agencies.  The customer agencies vary in size and have headquarters and field offices in locations throughout the United States.  One of these services, Accounts Payable (AP), requires invoices to be routed and approved by Certifying Officials at the customer agencies.  These invoices arrive from the vendor to the ARC Accounts Payable office.  After some initial work by the technician, the invoices are routed through various contacts at the customer agencies for approval.  The customer agency applies their approval, includes any comments or instructions such as proper accounting, and routes the invoice back to AP.   

In order to more efficiently service our customers, ARC is seeking information on applications that will minimize the paper flow, streamline the invoice routing and approval process and meet the following requirements:

General
1.	Integration with Oracle Federal Financials.

5.	Accept Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) data and convert it to easily understandable format for users.
6.	Accept supplemental documents and comments and attach them to related invoice(s).

Routing and Approval
1.	Allow customizable business rules for workflow by organizational unit.
2.	Allow creation of customizable forms for use by customer agencies to submit data to AP.
3.	Provide customizable email notifications and reminders to various responsibilities that actions are pending.
4.	Allow the invoice to be ?Rejected? in the system when the hard copy is returned to the vendor.

Archiving
1.	Maintain electronic copy of imaged invoices and action history for research.
2.	Ability to archive data from prior years based on business rules.

Reporting
1.	Maintain performance statistics for Ad Hoc reporting.
2.	Maintain document history of all status changes and actions taken by user and system, date, and time.
3.	Database must be accessible via Oracle Discoverer for reporting.

Security
1.	Allow invoices to be moved to different organizational unit in case of erroneous entry.
2.	Must use integrated (trusted) security in conjunction with Domain accounts.
3.	Provide a function that displays to individual users, only those records they are permitted to view, as provided by permission levels to read, modify, or access data granted by the administrator(s).
4.	Provide a role for an administrator(s).  The administrator(s) shall be provided tools for updating files of information, adding/deleting users, and other functions that will not be available to end users of the software.

<DESC>Purpose:  To describe the work to be included in a contract to modify the Visual Examination and Repackaging Building (VERB) Secondary Containment Structure (SCS), also known as the Perma-Con?, to support Oversized Box Repackaging planned for Project 7005.

Statement of Work:  This work will modify the current structure of the VERB SCS originally constructed under previous contract and described in the drawings shown in the Drawings List.

This contract will include the design and fabrication necessary to: 

1.	Expand the SCS airlock doors from current dimensions to an 8-foot opening to allow the entry of the oversized boxes with the largest overall dimensions of L=164", W=76", H=81".

2.	The SCS design shall include the identification of locations in the SCS structure for the installation of appropriately sized ventilation ports to allow the total air flow of approximately 6000 cfm into the SCS.  These ports will be provided with removable filtration of appropriate size and construction to support the design.

3.	The SCS will be modified to include an exhaust filter bank to accommodate the 6000 cfm from the High Contamination Area (HCA) portion of the SCS.  This filter bank shall be constructed to at or near floor level to minimize contamination spread throughout the HCA.

4.	The SCS will be modified to add two moveable point ventilation sources in the HCA section of the SCS.  These point ventilation sources will be equipped with independent HEPA filtration as shown in Drawing 07005-005-32-M2 of the VERB design package.  These moveable point sources must have a range of motion from floor level to a height of 81".

5.	The design will include exhaust ducting from the exhaust filter bank to the exhaust fan isolation dampers HVAC-DMP-101, HVAC-DMP-201 and HVAC-DMP-301 as shown in Drawing 07005-005-32-M2.

6.	The design will maintain the PC2 functional classification for seismic consistent with the original design of the SCS.

7.	The contract will include costs associated with the transport and supervision of installation of all designed and fabricated equipment.

8.	Design calculations will be provided by the vendor to demonstrate adequacy of design for airflows and seismic events.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 10 calendar days from the date of this synopsis. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), has a requirement for additional customized computer systems to upgrade the current NEIC processing system. There are currently 50 unique systems in use at the NEIC, customized to meet specific USGS requirements. Additional systems must be fully compatible with the current systems. Because these systems will be used for monitoring in a mission critical system, maintenance is also required as follows: 1) Local, on-site support available seven days per week; 2) Repair of critical components within 24 hours of notification of problem; 3) Trouble shooting, as required, either remotely or on-site; 4) Replacing faulty or dubious hardware components, when necessary. A local Microsoft-Certified technician is required who is familiar with the architecture, components, and functionality of the 50 custom systems currently in use at the NEIC. Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services and supplies specified as a sole source from Bill Bennett, Centennial, Colorado, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>BAA 0701AEDCPKP:  The Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center (DTRMC), through Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) is soliciting research proposals in the area of hypersonics testing and evaluation/science and technology (T&E/S&T) development.   DTRMC seeks innovative proposals that will allow improved test and evaluation of current and future hypersonics systems over the next 10 to 15 years.  The goal is not to develop hypersonic flight systems or subsystems in this solicitation, but to investigate improved ground and flight test facilities, techniques and test methodologies that are needed to support hypersonic system/subsystem development.  This program does not support basic research, but rather the application and extension of technology to produce and understand a real or simulated flight environment.  The range of interest covers all hypersonic flight, both sustained flight in the atmosphere and the test environment of reentry vehicles.  TRMC seeks advances in hypersonic and related technologies in the areas (not in priority): 

(1)       Open air range technologies Planned high speed and hypersonic flight tests are in need of large controlled range spaces, innovative diagnostic technologies and flight test techniques. The specific needs within these range technology topics are detailed below. 
a.	Non intrusive flight diagnostics This task seeks to expand the amount of data taken from a flight test article.  Points of interest include thrust determination, thermal protection systems effectiveness, and miniaturization. Developed systems should be tested in ground facilities with the goal of possible demonstration in a flight test. 
b.	Autonomous flight termination system Operating a hypersonic system over land presents risks especially with test articles that veer off planned trajectories.  This effort seeks a system that could reliably and safely terminate a test vehicle during any portion of a flight test. Demonstration of the proposed methodology via ground test or flight tests is encouraged. 
c.	Flight test techniques High Speed and Hypersonic Systems will be tested over vast areas of land and water.  This task seeks to develop innovative flight test methods to reduce the test footprint and improve data quality over large areas of vastly differing terrain.

(2)	Test methodologies and evaluation of freejet test articles Current high speed and hypersonic freejet test techniques lead to thrust measurements with a high level of uncertainty. This effort seeks methodology, for use in DoD test facilities similar to APTU or ASTF, which could obtain high accuracy, thrust measurements from a ramjet or scramjet engine in a freejet test. Demonstration in the appropriate test environment is encouraged.

(3)	Propulsion system scaling laws As the size of high speed hypersonic propulsion systems increase, large scale propulsion test facilities (in the near term) will likely not be available in time to support technology developers. One means to alleviate some of the facility size requirements is to implement scaling parameters for propulsion tests. This enables sub-scale test articles to run in smaller tunnels yet output properties applicable for larger systems.  The objective of this solicitation is to look at current scaling methods, select those applicable to hypersonic propulsion, and demonstrate these methods via actual test articles supporting technology programs.  

(4)	Long runtime clean air true temperature test capabilities above Mach 8 Current propulsion test facilities are incapable of producing hypersonic, true temperature clean air flow beyond Mach 8 for seconds.   Though the capability to achieve flows of much higher speeds exists, it is typically in the sub-second scale.  This effort should investigate enabling technologies that could lead to a Mach 8+ facility.

(5)	Modeling and simulation data integration Data from ground and flight tests and results of CFD codes are often collected and never integrated into Integrated Test and Evaluation (IT&E) tools and methods.  This task seeks to create a comprehensive and expandable data management process that can select and store applicable hypersonic test and modeling data, providing a method for the test and analyses engineers to integrate these tools into the IT&E for the development of High Speed and Hypersonic systems. 

(6)	Arc heater diagnosis of high enthalpy flow Arc Heater test capabilities are critical for the future development of thermal protection systems.  The current suites of sensors that diagnostic tools utilize in arc heater tests are limited. This effort seeks to develop sensors and techniques to characterize and sample high enthalpy flows as well as capture surface temperatures of arc heater test articles. 

(7)	Environmental testing Planned hypersonic vehicles that operate in the earth atmosphere will likely encounter liquid and solid hydrometeors.  Existing test facilities have been used to simulate liquid hydrometeors in the appropriate flight environments.  This task seeks to understand the technology needed to simulate solid water flight conditions such as hail and snow.  Successful proposals would demonstrate methods in relevant test facilities. 

(8)	Flight fuel characteristics simulation and testing Fuel will be used as coolant on a hypersonic vehicle and will arrive at the engine with changes in temperature and structure from that carried in the fuel tank.  Test facilities need to provide this same fuel state to test engines.  With emphasis on hydrocarbon fuels and existing data (where possible), evaluate the range of cooling schemes being proposed in flight, determine the conditions of the fuel reaching the flight engine, study and determine the best method of duplicating the process in the ground test facility, and recommend appropriate hardware required to develop fuel simulation test capabilities suitable to a wide range of test articles. The goal of this solicitation is to provide validated criteria for a prototype test rig that could be verified in an appropriate test capability.

(9)	Evaluation of run-time on data suitability Mid to far term testing requirements point to test capabilities beyond Mach 8.  Currently no medium to long duration hypersonic propulsion tunnels exist that can operate at these Mach numbers.  One means to mitigate this gap is to use existing facilities and compare the results from short (minutes) duration tunnels to impulse (millisecond) tunnels.  This effort seeks techniques and solutions, from existing data (where possible), that correlate impulse and short duration tunnel results with longer duration tunnels. The objective is to demonstrate the applicability of hypersonic propulsion data from impulse facilities, with the intent to accept such data at higher Mach conditions were longer runtime data may not be available in the near-term. Solicitations should also include the proposed methodologies for obtaining non-existing data and means to validate results.

(10)	Nozzle Development Hypersonic vehicle design requires the highest quality data for validation of vehicle aerodynamic/aerothermodynamic CFD simulations.  This requirement has put a new emphasis on wind tunnel data quality and the influence of nozzle flow quality and uniformity on this data.  This task seeks to improve and demonstrate new or existing tools for purpose of future nozzle design and/or the improvement and demonstration of new or existing tools used to interpret nozzle flow parameters.

(11)	Other Technologies This topic area allows offerors to identify potential technology development opportunities not identified in previous topic areas, but may be beneficial and critical to the development of technologies to enable rapid HSH T&E capability development.

PROJECT SCOPE:  Awards totaling approximately $1-$2M are expected to be made in FY08.  Increased funding levels are anticipated to occur in the following fiscal years.  Prospective proposers should be aware that there is no certainty in the funding or level of effort.  

GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposals should address development and/or operational test and evaluation technologies.  DTRMC strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities.  Teaming among academia, industry, and/or government partners is encouraged; however, this is no a requirement.  Projects with strong transition plans to DoD T&E ground or flight test facilities or with DoD T&E facility participation will receive preference.  Because awards may be made in which contractors expect to access or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public, the contracts will contain DFARS Clause 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.  This requirement will be in subcontracts as well.  Projects will be awarded in phases with the later phases being funded in FY08 or later and will be contingent on funds availability, merit of performance and previous phases, and anticipated future T&E requirements for the technologies being addressed.  In order to minimize the magnitude of the proposal preparation and review process, a proposal abstract of no more than 15 pages total should be submitted by 8 June 2007.  Each proposal should specify the benefits to U.S. military service and the executing organization with subcontractors (where applicable), and their specific roles.  The proposal should briefly describe the out-year effort beyond completion of the Phase I effort.  Each proposal should address a specific T&E hypersonic need.

Each proposer and subcontractor will be required to submit written verification stating they are aware of their responsibility to have DoD approval for public release of information pertaining to the proposed project (including technical reports, papers, and presentations) as required by DoD regulations regarding t he dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

EVALUATION:  Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria:  (1)  overall scientific and technical merit, (2)  relevance to current T&E hypersonic technology test requirements not addressed in other DoD programs, (3) offeror?s capabilities and related experience, (4) cost realism of proposed effort and (5) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition to T&E application and/or to DoD T&E facilities.  Upon review, the Hypersonic Test Working Group, through AEDC, will respond to proposal abstracts with a recommendation to submit or not to submit a full proposal and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposals and proposal abstracts should be submitted on CD-ROM in .PDF format and forwarded to:  AEDC/PKP, Attn:  Sue Tate, 100 Kindel Drive Suite A332, Arnold AFB TN  37389-1332.

<DESC>The US Army Research Development Evaluation Command (RDECOM) Acquisition Center, Aberdeen, MD intends to negotiate on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency  requirements and under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C., Section 2304 (c) (1) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and Congressional delineated funding for Port and Hull Security 3D, Real Time Sonar System  Echoscope.  The RDECOM Acquisition Center intends to negoti ate and award a contract to Coda Octopus, Inc. Bluewater House, 100 14th avenue South, St. Petersburg, FL 33701 for to development and building of three (3) CG Underwater Inspection Systems (UISs) with training schedule, full system manuals and a guarantee  as discussed.  The prototype systems developed will be capable of the following: A. Provide the USCG with the availability of the capability to rapidly conduct searches for threats and parasitic attachments below the surface in low-visibility subsurface c onditions. B.  Independent of ambient light (night operations).  C.  Usable on Coast Guard small boats at 3 to 5 knots to cover 18,000 to 30,000 linear feet of bulkhead per hour.  D.  Capable of guaranteeing 100% inspection coverage.  E. Usable with minima l risk to Coast Guard personnel and assets.  F.  Intuitive user display (no specialty skills/rating required).  G.  Minimizes required specialty operator skills.  H.  Capable of being used effectively during a National Security Event.  I.  Compatible with current Coast Guard security operations.  J.  Weather effect limitations are minimized (wind/waves/ice).  K.  Effects of current are minimized.  L.  Field of view is maximized.  M.  Can be used in navigationally restricted environments.  N.  Document area coverage for subsequent review and comparison.  The Echoscope Real Time 3D Sonar is a unique and patented technology that will form the core of any system developed.  The Coda Octopus Coast Guard Underwater Inspection System (CG UIS) concept integrates the  Echoscope with other commercially available sensors designed for integration on a small vessel.  An integrated systems approach is necessary to fulfill the USCG requirements and Coda Octopus are uniquely placed to develop and supply these systems.  Option al UIS Developments are as follows:  A. Range Resolution Enhancement.  Develop core beam forming hardware and FPGA technology to improve the current 3 or 4cm range resolution to 1 or 2cm, and increase target detection of objects on harbor walls and other c lose range applications. B. Increased Echoscope Frequency.  Develop new transducer and channel board hardware to allow operation at higher frequencies (up to 500KHz).  Given the modular design of the Echoscope, it would then be feasible to allow dual trans ducers to be mounted simultaneously and provide multiple target returns at different frequencies (375KHz and 500KHz).  Increasing the frequency of operation to 500KHz would also increase the resolution of the data and reduce the volume to approximately 25 x 25deg  effectively doubling the lateral resolution.  C.  Automated Change Detection.  Develop Automated Change Detection algorithms for on-line detection and post-processing analysis of captured Echoscope data.  The data post-mission would reside on a l arge-scale SQL database allow several over-time analysis to be generated as well as know-good baseline surveys for real time analysis.  Algorithm would be backwards compatible with existing UIS systems to enable all users to add this additional software ca pability on a per license basis.  D. Advanced Prototype UIS Systems.  Build additional UIS systems to agreed USCG specification.  E.  Methodology Analysis and Review.  Conduct extensive review of operations with the R&D team to better refine the capture, p rocessing and analysis approach for increased accuracy, efficiency and repeatability.  This would involve a full review of the process inputs and outputs to all ow the UIS to integrate with other detection methodology and reporting outputs and may result in additional software and hardware developments to provide a seamless approach for deployment at other USCG sites.  F.  Development of Prototype One Piece F190 I nertial Navigation System to Upgrade UIS Capability.  Develop a one piece F190 Inertial Attitude and Positioning System to replace standard two piece system used in UIS.  It is estimated that this will assist in rapid deployment and calibration of the UIS systems further enhancing the systems operability. Interested firms have 15 calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis to submit in writing clear and convincing documentation of their companies capability to provide required service to the US Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, 4118 Susquehan na Avenue, ATTN:  AMSRD-ACC-CS / Paula Kestler, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-3013.

<SUBJECT>Y -- AMC WEST GROUP HOUSING PRIVATIZATION PROJECT
<DESC>Jones Lang LaSalle, Privatization Real Estate Support Services contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), Air Mobility Command (AMC) and Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), announces the release of the Statement of Need for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Fairchild AFB, Tinker AFB and Travis AFB (AMC West Group).  The Statement of Need is available on the Web at http://www.jllpress.com
The AMC West Group Project is a real estate transaction to privatize 2,435 military family housing units at three Air Force installations.  The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 2,435 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years.  The Government will lease the land.  The existing 3,936 housing units, primary and secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will convey by Quitclaim Deed to the Project Owner (PO).  An additional 226 units and underlying 84 acres will be conveyed for consideration.  The Government may subsidize the project's financing as described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  The PO will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the AMC West Group family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the PO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the PO.  
The Air Force anticipates release of the RFP for the AMC West Group project on or about 11 May 2007.  The Air Force intends to employ a One-Step RFP process.  In their proposals, each prospective Offeror (or Offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources, financial strategy, and a description of its technical approach to the AMC West Group Project as described in the RFP.  Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Highest Ranking Offeror (HRO) to the Air Force.  The HRO will then begin negotiations with the Air Force and complete additional remaining submittal requirements needed for closing the real estate transaction.  These additional submittal requirements are also identified in the RFP.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Request for Proposal will be available at http://www.jllpress.com.

<SUBJECT>--RP-7 Robot Telepresence System
<DESC>The U.S. Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) at Fort Derrick, Maryland intends to support a continuation of the recent in-house research conducted at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC), Fort Sam Houston, Texas using the I nTouch Technologies, Inc. RP-7 Robot Telepresence System currently leased under contract W81XWH-07-P-0077.  The original feasibility study covered a period of six months, which ends on 5 June 2007.  It is the intent of this effort to lease the Telepresence  RP-7 Robot for an additional twelve months (6 Jun 07 to 5 Jun 08).   The feasibility study examined the ability of telepresence technology to enhance the capabilities of physicians by allowing for virtual presence.  Recent studies have demonstrated that 24/7 coverage of Intensive Care Units (ICU) by care providers via tel epresence may improve treatment outcomes.  Remote Presence (RP) is a wireless mobile robotic telemedicine technology which consists of a laptop control station and a robot. The system is designed to use a broadband internet connection to connect the physic ian to the robot from a remote location. Until now, to our knowledge, successful use of this RP capability in burn care or in a military hospital setting has never been reported.  Thus far the study has yielded a success rating, as determined by physicians , nurses, residents, and patient family members, of 8.48 on a scale of 1 to 10.  Furthermore, the RP-7 has developed into a standard of care accepted and expected by the professional staff of the ISR ICU.   A twelve month extension of this lease will allow this technology to remain in use in the ISR ICU while the technology fully matures.  It will allow the ISR ICU practitioners to continue using this valuable resource while, at the same time, providing thoro ugh and detailed evaluations on its potential in state side military hospitals and how it may be inserted to combat zone environments.  This ultimately will expedite the development of RP technology where it can potentially be adopted as a standard system and transferred to the acquisition system. All responses should be submitted by electronic mail only to stephen.yuter@us.army.mil no later than Tuesday, May 8, 2007 at 5:00 p.m. (EST). USAMRAA Point of Contact is: Stephen J. Yuter, Contract Specialist, (301) 619-2618.

IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act 		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service  		SSA - Social Security Administration 		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program 		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor) (a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.  	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.  	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm . 	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9. (1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235. (2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. (3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.  	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.  	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.  	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request fro competitive proposals.

Attempting to integrate an alternate system into the current structure would create huge management issues regarding hard drive compatibility, maintaining spare parts and patch management issues.

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  Efforts have been made to identify other contractors for this requirement by soliciting this requirement from known computer sources as well as in FedBizOpps; the single government point-of-entry (GPE) for Federal government procurement opportunities. All interested Hewlett-Packard dealers/distributors will be afforded the opportunity to participate in this acquisition.

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.  The Contracting Officer hereby determines that the cost to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable based upon sufficient competition obtained by posting the combined synopsis/solicitation to FedBizOpps, the vendor's commercial product price list and quotes obtained through open market research.

8.  Description of Market Research.  Upon initial receipt of this requirement, a market survey was conducted to determine if this requirement could be solicited among small businesses, through open market research and under the GSA Schedule. Multiple businesses, many of whom were small businesses, were found to be capable of providing the HP product. It is not the CDP's intent to sole source to Hewlett Packard; the intent is to solicit full and open using the combined synopsis solicitation with the expectation that businesses can quote the item through partnering with Hewlett Packard or acting as a distributor for HP products. All interested HP dealers/distributors will be afforded the opportunity to participate in this acquisition.

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.  
In order to minimize compatibility issues, the necessity of maintaining a standard image, decrease patch management issues and reduce the need for stockpiling spare parts and hard drives it is necessary to control the types of equipment used.

10.   A Listing of the Sources, if any, that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.  The only source considered for this procurement action is Hewlett-Packard and its dealers/distributors. 

11.  A statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition of supplies or services are required.   No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition will be taken, as the Hewlett-Packard "brand name" is the only known system capable of satisfying this agency's requirement.

The following justification and approval is provided for other than full and open competition for this purchase. 

1.   Agency and Contracting Activity:  The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Grants and Training, the Preparedness Directorate, Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP), Anniston, Alabama, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition.

2.   Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved.  The CDP requested approval to solicit for a specific "brand name" purchase, of Motorola Astro Digital XTS5000 Model III, 800 MHz Portable Radios for the CDP Operations Center.  The Motorola radios are essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  These radios are required to replace obsolete radios currently in use in the CDP Operations Center.  

3.   Description of Supplies/Services.  This requirement is for the purchase of Motorola Astro Digital XTS5000 Model III, 800 MHz Portable Radios. Due to compatibility issues with the on-going upgrade of the Calhoun County Emergency Management Agency's (CCEMA) 800 MHz communications system, the CDP is required to upgrade its existing radio equipment (XTS3000 and 5000 portable radios and XLT 5000 base/mobile radios). These radios will allow the CDP to continue to be compatible with the local emergency management community. The "brand name" Motorola is the only known source that can provide the equipment.  

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (5) as stated in FAR 6.302-1, entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements".

5.  Demonstration that the Nature of the Acquisition Required Use of the Authority Cited.  In 2005 the CDP emergency communication system was upgraded with the Motorola XLT 5000 Consolette Base Station, 800 MHz emergency services radio system. In addition, the CCEMA has similarly upgraded to operate in a related structure. The Motorola Astro Digital XLS 5000 Model III portable radios are necessary to ensure the critical interoperability and communications between the CDP and the CCEMA community during emergency operations.  The CDP's radio system uses and takes advantage of the Calhoun County Emergency Radio system and infrastructure.  The CDP benefits from the Calhoun County FCC license, frequency and access to other emergency services.   

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  Efforts have been made to identify other contractors for this requirement by synopsizing this requirement in FedBizOpps; the single government point-of-entry (GPE) for Federal government procurement opportunities. All interested Motorola dealers/distributors will be afforded the opportunity to participate in the acquisition.

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.  The Contracting Officer hereby determines that the cost to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable based upon sufficient competition obtained by posting the combined synopsis/solicitation to FedBizOpps and the vendor's commercial product price list.

8.  Description of Market Research.  Upon initial receipt of this requirement, a market survey was conducted to determine if this requirement could be solicited among small businesses under the GSA Schedule.

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.  
As an integral member of the Calhoun County emergency management community it is essential that equipment used by the CDP be compatible with the equipment used by the local emergency management community. To do otherwise would jeopardize the CDP's ability to interact and communicate effectively with the local emergency management community.  If the CDP cannot effectively communicate and interact in a time of crisis, it would significantly impact safety and human life.

10.   A Listing of the Sources, if any, that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.  The only source considered for this procurement action is Motorola and its dealers/distributors. No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition.

11.  A statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition of supplies or services are required.   No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition will be taken, as the Motorola "brand name" Astro Digital XTS 5000 Model III portable radios is the only known system capable of satisfying this agency's requirement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote; the solicitation number is SP3100-7080-3150.  This solicitation is Unrestricted. 
The Defense Distribution Center, San Joaquin, CA (DDJC) has requirements for Model 4800 Wired Scan Guns, and Model 3870 Cordless PDF Scanners with DLA firmware, cables, and batteries as described below (CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002).  
This is a Brand Name requirement due to compatibility and standardization issues; the justification for this Brand Name is as follows:
The personnel using these scanners and cables will be working with the Distribution Standard System (DSS), the current standard distribution system to support the DOD logistics pipeline.  One of the key components to this distribution network is 2D capable scanners that can scan 2D detailed barcodes and forms.  During the last five (5) years, DSS has been transformed into a standardized hardware configuration that includes the Welch Allyn/HHP scanners and associated cables.  Additional software changes have been made to these scanners to accommodate the scanning of print programs.  The cost to the Government to switch to another brand of scanner is estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars (or more), and would require DDC to expend significant resources to rigorously test and validate the new system.  Significant testing of other brands of scanners to function on DLA converted barcodes has not been successful so far.  DDJC requires new scanners and cables that will be compatible with the DSS system.  The Welch Allyn/HHP models 4800 and 3870 scanners, and associated cables, are the only models that will meet this compatibility requirement. 
CLIN 0001 is for a quantity of 50 EA HHP Model 4800 Wired Scan Gun with USB connection.  Cord length: minimum 12-foot long, maximum 15-foot long.
CLIN 0002 is for a quantity of 38 EA HHP Model 3870 Cordless PDF Scanner with DLA firmware, to include scanner, USB Base Station, two (2) cables as described below, and one (1) battery.  The cables are specified as follows: one (1) cable (comes with base station) PS-2 dir conn, 3 feet in length, with 15 pin male connection on base station end and male ps2 connection on other end, part number HHP 3202 Rev b or 42205610-01; one (1) cable (to convert PS-2 to USB) 3 feet in length, with ps2 female connection on one end and USB connection on other end.
Offerors shall provide the unit price for each component and the total amount, inclusive of shipping costs (FOB Destination).  Equipment shall be shipped to the Defense Distribution Depot San Joaquin, Supply Branch, Warehouse 3 Tracy Site (SB3200), Tracy, CA 95376-5000.  Note: Desired delivery schedule is 2 weeks ARO and Required delivery schedule is 30 days ARO.

RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS FROM PROSPECTIVE OFFEROR

1. Memory Line item p/n 343057-12G is a ML370 memory chip of 6x2GB.  This is not recommended by HP and would void the warranty. I need to have an explanation from them why they choose this chip for the ML570 whereas they are indicating exact specs for image. And if not, what chip did the mean? 
RESPONSE: Memory Line item part number is changed to read 343057-B21

2.  The HP Controller Array P400/256 PCIe controller 405132-B21 Is the controller for the ML370.  The ML570 comes with the same controller but 512 cache.  It takes up a slot.  Is it that they are requesting a second controller with less cache because of the image?  or would like two controllers?  
RESPONSE: HP Smart Array P400/256 Controller 405132-B21 is the controller specified by Hewlett-Packard for the ML570.

<DESC>Amendment: 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors Commercial Items (Sept 2006) Add: (b) Past Performance: The Offeror shall provide a list of three, similar contracts or subcontracts held within the last five years which are of a similar scope, magnitude and complexity to that which is detailed in this solicitation. The Offeror shall include Point of Contact telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses where available. NOTE: Clauses incorporated into the contract in full text are provided below. It is the Offerors responsibility to read the clauses incorporated and follow any instructions listed therein.  Clauses Incorporated in Full Text: Polygraph: The successful completion of a polygraph examination may be a requirement of the security clearance and/or access processing of a contractor candidate, in order for the contractor candidate to gain or continue access to FBI facilities and/or information.(End of Clause) Consent for Warrantless Searches of Department of Justice Workplace: All cleared personnel accessing information within FBI controlled space are required to execute an FBI Form 1001 Consent for Warrantless Searches of Department of Justice (DOJ) Workplaces as a condition of working at FBI facilities.  The Director, FBI, implemented the Attorney Generals policy subjecting employees to Warrantless physical searches of their offices or immediate workplace within DOJ premises when authorized by the Attorney General (AG) or the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) based upon a determination that: (1)Information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee is, or may be, disclosing classified information in an unauthorized manner; (2)Information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee has incurred  excessive indebtedness or has acquired a level of affluence that can not be reasonably explained by other information; (3) Information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee had the capability and opportunity to disclose classified information that is believed to have been lost or compromised to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign country; or (4) Information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee has repeatedly or significantly mishandled or improperly stored classified information. The search may extend to the entire office or workplace and anything within it that might hold classified information, including locked containers (such as briefcases) and electronic storage media (such as a computer disk and handheld computers), whether owned by the government, by the employee, or by a third party.  The search may be conducted by appropriate FBI personnel and/or law enforcement officers, on an announced or unannounced basis, during the workday or after hours.  If discovered during a search, evidence of misconduct, whether related to storage or classified information, storage of sensitive but unclassified information, or a crime will be collected and reported to appropriate authorities. Contractor personnel who will meet the above criteria will be required to sign Form FD 1001 Consent for Warrantless Searches of Department of Justice (DOJ) Workplaces upon award and forward the executed form(s) to the assigned Contracting Officers Technical representative designated in the solicitation if this is a formal solicitation.  All forms will be retained by the FBI during the period the individual is providing services and two years after that individuals departure before final disposition is taken.(End of Clause) Clauses for Contracts Involving Access to Classified Information: Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 of the NISPOM, the Government intends to secure services or equipment from firms which are not under foreign ownership, control or influence (FOCI) or where any FOCI, in the opinion of the Government, adversely impacts on security requirements.  The Government reserves the right to contract with such offerors under appropriate arrangements, when it determines that such contract will be in the best interest of the Government. Accordingly, all Offerors responding to this Request for Quote (RFQ) or initiating performance of a contract are required to submit a certificate pertaining to Foreign Interest (SF 328) or update a previously submitted SF 328, and a Key Management Personnel List (KMPL) with their proposal.  All SF 328s and KMPLs shall be executed at the parent and subsidiary levels of an organization.  Offerors are also required to request, collect, and forward to the Government the SF 328 from all subcontractors undertaking classified work under the Offeror?s direction and control.  Offerors are responsible for the thoroughness and completeness of each subcontractor?s SF 328 submission.  SF 328 entries should specify, where necessary, the identity, nature, degree and impact of the FOCI on their organization or activities, or the organization or activities of a subcontractor.  Additionally, a KMPL must be submitted with each SF 328 that identifies senior management by name, position, social security number, date/place of birth, and citizenship status. The Offeror shall, in any case in which it believes that foreign influence exists or is being sought over its affairs, or the affairs of any subcontractor, promptly notify the Contracting Officers Security Representative of all pertinent facts, even if such influence is not exerted to the degree specified in the NISPOM. The Offeror shall provide an updated SF 238 and KMPL no later than five years from the date as certified on the last submitted SF 328.  The Selected Offeror shall also promptly disclose to the Contracting Officers Security Representative any information pertaining to any interest of a FOCI nature in the Selected Offeror or subcontractor that has developed at any time during the Selected Offerors duration or has subsequently come to the Selected Offerors attention.  An updated SF 328 is required of the Selected Offeror or any subcontractor whenever there is a change to any of the ten (10) questions on the SF 328. The Offeror is responsible for initiating the submission of the SF 328 and KMPL for all subcontractors undertaking classified work during the entire period of performance of the contract.  Failure to comply shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this contract. Offerors shall complete the Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests (SF 328) and KMPL for the prime contractor and all proposed subcontractors.  Submission should include identification of the RFQ number, name of the assigned Contracting Officer, and certification of the accuracy of the provided information by an Executive Management Official of the company.  Provision of false information shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this contract. The Government reserves the right to prohibit individuals who are not United States citizens from all or certain aspects of the work to be performed under this contract.  Foreign Ownership, Control of Influence (FOCI) For purposes of this clause, a United States company is considered under FOCI whenever a foreign interest has the power, direct or indirect, and whether or not exercisable through the ownership of the United Stats companys securities, by contractual arrangements or other means, to direct or decide matters affecting the management or operations of that company. Changed conditions, such as change in ownership, indebtedness, or the foreign intelligence threat, may justify certain adjustments to the security terms under which a company is operating, or alternatively, that different FOCI mitigation measures be employed.  If a changed condition is of sufficient significance, it might also result in a determination that a company is no longer considered to be under FOCI.  There is a continuing obligation of the Selected Offeror to advise the Government of such changed conditions.  Failure to abide by this obligation shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this contract. Factors The following factors will be used as the basis for making a FOCI determination.  If the Offeror, or its proposed subcontractors, meet any of the following factors, they must identify themselves as a potential FOCI company and submit themselves to a Government FOCI evaluation and risk assessment. (1) Ownership or beneficial ownership, direct or indirect, of five (5) percent or more of the company?s voting securities by a foreign person. (2) Ownership or beneficial ownership, direct or indirect, of twenty five (25) percent or more of any class of the Offerors company?s nonvoting securities by a foreign person. (3) Management positions, such as directors, officers or executive personnel of the Offerors company held by non-U.S. citizens.  (4) Foreign person power, direct or indirect, to control the election, appointment, or tenure of directors, officers or executive personnel of the Offerors company or other decisions or activities of the Offerors company. (5) Contracts, agreements, understandings or arrangements between the Offerors company and a foreign person. (6) Loan arrangements between the Offerors company and a foreign person if the Offerors companys (the borrower) overall debt to equity ration is 40:60 or greater; or financial obligations that are subject to the ability of a foreign person to demand repayment. (7) Annual total revenues or net income in excess of five (5) percent from a single foreign person or in excess of thirty (30) percent from foreign persons in the aggregate. (8) Ten (10) percent or more of any class of the Offerors voting securities held in nominee shares, in street names, or in some other method that does not disclose the beneficial ownership of equitable title. (9) Interlocking directors with foreign persons and any officer or management official of the Offerors company who is also employed by a foreign person. (10) Any other factor that indicates or demonstrates a capability on the part of foreign persons to control or influence the operations or management of the Offerors company. (11)  Ownership of ten (10) percent or more of any foreign interest. Every effort must be made to ensure that supplies are provided and integrated and services are performed using sound security components, practices, and procedures.  Acquisition of supplies or services from concerns under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influent (FOCI) or of supplies developed, manufactured, maintained or modified by concerns under FOCI (any or all of which shall be referred to herein as Use of FOCI source) is of serious concern and must be approved prior to contract award and evaluation during contract performance. Approval decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after the source or technology has been identified by the Offeror and subjected to a risk assessment. Any Offeror responding to this Request for Quote (RFQ) acknowledges the Governments requirements to secure services or equipment from firms which are not under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI), or where any FOCI, in the opinion of the Government, adversely impacts on National Security or security requirements.  The Offeror understands and agrees that the Government retains the right to reject any response to this RFQ made by the Offeror without any further recourse by or explanation to the Offeror, if the FOCI for that Offeror is determined by the Government to be an unacceptable security risk. The risk assessment process will vary depending on the acquisition type and proposed use of the FOCI source, available risk mitigation measures and the information/justification provided by the Offeror. Risk assessment will be on a case-by-case basis and will be used to determine whether the use of a FOCI source poses an unacceptable security risk.  If an unacceptable security risk is determined, the Government retains the right to reject the use of a FOCI source or to require that certain risk mitigation measures by taken by the contractor.  Similarly, the Government retains the unilateral right to approve the use of a FOCI source when the risk management indicates that such use would be in the Governments best interest.  If the use of a FOCI source is not approved, no such classified information will be disclosed to the Offeror as part of the Governments rationale for non-approval.  The Offeror (prime and subs) may not seek reimbursement from the Government for any costs associated with responding to this RFQ as a result of a FOCI non-approval decision. (End of Clause) Amendment to Clause-SF 328 Submissions: The Offerors SF 328 should be dated at the time of quotation submission or within a one-year period from the date of the quotation.  If the SF 328 is not current within a one-year period, confirmation of the accuracy of the information provided on the previously submitted SF 328 is required.  This confirmation must be provided on the Offerors stationary and acknowledged by an individual authorized to execute the SF 328. If through another procurement request, the Offeror has provided the FBI with a completed SF 328, the Offeror can provide a statement to that affect.  The statement must include the date of the SF 328 and identification of the procurement for which the SF 328 was submitted and confirmation of the accuracy of the information provided on the previously submitted SF 328.  This confirmation must be provided on the Offerors stationary and acknowledged by an individual authorized to execute the SF 328.

(End of Clause) Form SF 328 may be found at www.gsa.gov, Forms Library, Standard Forms, Form Numbers 1-1000, form 328.

<DESC>The purpose of this document is to amend reference synopsis/solicitation. Part I represents questions and answers to potential offeror concerns.  Part II represents language that is deleted and/or added:

Part I: - Below are IRS? answers to timely received industry questions. 

Question1:  	What is the average payment? 
Answer 1:  	IRS anticipates that the average payment for each kiosk cash transition to be $550.00

Question 2:	What are largest payments? 
Answer 2:	IRS anticipates that the largest payment will be $6,000.

Question 3:	Is there a limit to how much currency you will accept from one payer? 
Answer 3:	No, IRS does not have a currency limitation restriction.

Question 4:	When do you receive these payments? 	
Answer 4:	IRS receives payments throughout the year. 

Question 5:	Are they spread evenly throughout the month or, are they clustered around the specific dates?
Answer 5:	The volume for receipt of payments is heaviest from June 1st to August 31st.

Question 6:	Will there be a connection available for the kiosk? If so, what type (dial-up, DSL, Networtk, etc.).
Answer 6:	The IRS will provide a telephone line.  The offeror must provide the appropriate telecommunication speed to ensure quality and timely service.

Question 7:	Our armored carrier drivers will normally carry a sidearm during their daily rounds. They are licensed and insured in every state. What rules/regulations will they encounter in the IRS locations? Are they allowed to carry a weapon onto the property? This may impact the level of risk exposure for the drivers and subsequently, the cost of the cash management portion of the process. 
Answer 7:	The armed carriers will be allowed to carry their weapons while performing services under this contract. 




Question 8:	[Third Party] License Agreement.
Our cash management partner requires the site operator, in this case the Internal Revenue Service, sign a separate Site Operator Agreement. This agreement clarifies the ownership of the currency inside the kiosk and insures the bank will have access to the kiosk. I have attached a copy of the agreement for your review. 
Answer 8:	IRS does not enter into separate third party agreements.  Contracts/agreements such as that must be signed by the small business and the third party.  The contract the IRS signs will be with the small business that receives this award.  That contract between the IRS and the small business must contain all the binding language to fulfill this requirement.

If an award is made, it will be to the responsive offeror conforming to the solicitation that will represent the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered using a pass/fail and adjectival evaluation methodology.  

The selection will consist of a Best Value source selection process where submittals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria first.  Then submittals will be evaluated using a price/technical trade-off process.  Evaluation of the best value criteria will focus on a thorough comprehension of the requirements as delineated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and as reflected in the soundness and adequacy of the offeror?s submittal package.  However, the IRS will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  The non-price best value factors are listed in descending order of importance and, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. The Best value factors for selection are as follows (See Section IV ? Instructions to Offers):

1.	Acceptability of the requirement;
2.	Use of the offeror?s subcontracts;
3.	Organizational past performance;
4.	Compliance with the EIT accessibility standards;
5.	Organizational Experience

With respect to the factor number one (1) above, this factor will be evaluated on a pass or fail basis.  Offeror?s who receive a ?pass? rating, will be further evaluated for award.  In order for an offeror to receive a ?pass? rating, the offer must specifically state in their submittal package their acceptance of the requirement to provide a kiosk machine that only contains the functionalities listed within the performance work statement.  Offeror?s who receive a ?fail? rating will not be further evaluated and will not receive award.

With respect to factor number two (2) above, this factor will be evaluated on a pass or fail basis also.  Offeror?s who receive a ?pass? rating, will be further evaluated for award.  In order for an offeror to receive a ?pass? rating, the offer must specifically state in their submittal package that their subcontract effort will not exceed 49%.
 
The remaining factors speak to the offeror?s capabilities.  With respect to factor number three (3) above, Organizational Past performance will be evaluated to determine the success and/or failure of the offeror to meet the expectations of their contract and the firm/agency holding that contract.

With respect to factor number four (4) above, Compliance with the EIT standards will be evaluated to determine their compliance, or degree of compliance, with all the requirements as stated.  Those who are fully compliant will receive the highest possible evaluation.  Offerors who are compliant with the requirements as stated with only one requirement alteration, will receive a lessor evaluation, and so on.  The IRS will continue to evaluate offerors based on their ability to meet IRS standards.

With respect to factor number five (5) above, Organizational Experience will be evaluated to determine the breadth, depth, expertise and knowledge of the services and the offeror?s ability to meet IRS? PWS requirements to include, but not limited to, areas such as 1) schedule and 2) financial support services.   
[End of Provision]?

7)  In Attachment A ? Performance Matrix:

A)	DELETE  reference to ?Deduction Schedule? and ADD reference to ?Invoice Deduction Schedule?
B)	DELETE reference to ?Monday through Friday? and ADD reference to ?Monday through Friday, excluding Federal Holidays?
