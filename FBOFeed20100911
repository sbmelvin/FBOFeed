<DESC>TITLE: FA4809-10-Q-0324, Sole Source Acquisition for Vindicator Alarm System.<br />
<p>The 4th Contracting Squadron, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC intends to award a sole source purchase order to Open Roads Inc. Required items to be purchased for the upgrade of the Vindicator Alarm System. Materials included are as follows: a) alarm processor units (Qty 4). b) motion sensors (Qty 4). c) balanced magnetic switches (Qty 4). d) secure access keypads (Qty 4). e) enclosure with power back up (Qty 4). f) conduit (Qty 1). g) misc. electrical components (Qty 4). h) installation test and commission (Qty 64). i) program managment (Qty 4). j) shipping and handling(Qty 1). The current Vindicator Alarm System employed by Seymour Johnson AFB Security Forces is a proprietary product of Open Roads who has proprietary rights to all software, software maintenance, and specifications for this existing system. Manufacturer: Open Roads Inc.</p>
<p>This purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The closing date for this synopsis is 15 Sep 10 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. The anticipated award date is 17 Sep 10. For information regarding this purchase, please contact A1C Tiffany Gilbert at (919) 722-5408 or SSgt Ian Buschmann at (919) 722-5410.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: Request to award this requirement to only one responsible source, Open Roads Inc. In order to install and integrate a new Vindicator alarm system into the already existing Vindicator system on SJAFB a contractor would have to be certified to install Vindicator equipment and have access to the base network and the alarm system head end at Bldg 5005 and 5006 in order to program the new alarms into the system. Other companies may be certified to install Vindicator equipment; however, they will not be able to obtain access to Seymour Johnson's network due to OPSEC and INFOSEC reasons. Allowing base network access to a company for a single installation compromises Seymour Johnson's OPSEC and INFOSEC. Currently, Open Roads is the only contractor that is both certified to install Vindicator equipment and authorized access to the SJAFB network and the head end in Bldgs 5005 and 5006 in order to program the alarm system. Additionally, Open Roads is responsible for maintaining the Vindicator alarm system on SJAFB. Therefore, after the Vindicator system is installed at the four ITNs, Open Roads will be responsible for all periodic and emergency maintenance required for the system.</p>

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />This Sources Sought Notice is for market research and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is NOT a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or an announcement of a solicitation. Response to this Sources Sought Notice is strictly voluntary and will not affect any potential offeror's ability to submit an offer if a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The purpose of this document is to identify potential sources, conduct market research, and develop a complete requirement. Any requests for a solicitation package will be disregarded. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of preparing submissions in response to this notice and the Government's use of such information. Submittals will not be returned to the sender.<br /><br />Department of State, Office of Oceans, Environment, and Sciences, is seeking a qualified firm to provide a review of adaptation activities around the world and participate in five regional outreach workshops on behalf of the agency. The contractor should be an established U.S. firm with a minimum of three years in the specialized analysis and reporting activities described below.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines "adaptation" as the "adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities." Developing countries are highly vulnerable to climate variability and change and have the least capacity to respond. Anticipated effects of climate change represent a threat. Adaptation assistance helps developing countries to reduce the vulnerability of human or natural systems to the impacts of climate change and climate-related risks. Institutions around the world are substantially expanding their adaptation activities. While this is a welcome development, it calls for enhanced coordination among expanding networks of adaptation actors.</p>
<p>The Adaptation Partnership was created in May 2010. Its goal is to encourage effective adaptation. It will seek to synthesize lessons learned and good practices, highlight needs and priorities, and identify opportunities for cooperation and alignment of support to build resilience to the adverse effects of climate change.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT<br />This Partnership is commissioning a review which will cover priority regions and adaptation sectors. The review will provide a baseline of understanding, including an assessment of existing practices, factors that lead to success and failure, how adaptation is taken into consideration in development planning, and the scope of international support. The review, provided by the successful offeror, will help identify needs in each of these regions: Asia-Pacific, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. A major part of this effort will include participation at regional outreach workshops. The review will be used to inform the workshops. In total, the successful offeror will attend five workshops. The first workshop takes place November 10-12, 2010, in India. The remaining four workshops will take place in 2011. Locations and dates will be announced later in the year. The first draft of the review will be due to the State Department on November 19, 2010.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION DETAILS<br />Please respond no later than Thursday, September 16, 2010, 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time with a capabilities statement no longer than 3 pages in total length and no smaller than #10 font size. Please include your DUNS# and business size in your statement. Responses must be electronically submitted via email to koplendj@state.gov . Please send as an attachment in either Word or Adobe Acrobat format.</p>

<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Contracting and General Services, Portland, Oregon intends to extend a sole source purchase order for a base year plus 2 option years to CLS America, Largo, MD.  The Agency plans to award without competition under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, Other Than Full and Open Competition Procedures and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
The Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge has existing GPS/satellite transmitters on endangered California condors which cannot be disrupted in data collection.  The contractor has the capability to provide services in collecting data from several satellites in a manner required.  Disruption of service would be a financial impact to the service through lack of use of the GPS transmitters already purchased and the frequency used.  The necessary number of satellites provide reliable data.   By utilizing the services of CLS America, the data has been critical to the recovery of the species and understanding locations where environmental factors are affecting the species' recovery and assistance in making future decisions that affect condor populations.

Anyone (sole proprietors, corporations, partnerships and governmental organizations) desiring to do business with the federal government must register in CCR. However, CCR registration is not required for individuals seeking grants.  By registering in CCR, you gain the ability to bid on federal government contracts. Your CCR registration does not guarantee your winning a government contract or increasing your level of business. Registration is simply a prerequisite before bidding on a contract. 
ORCA (https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx)
You must be registered in ORCA if the solicitation you are responding to requires that you have an active registration in CCR.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is the primary vendor database for the U.S. Federal Government. Since October 1, 2003, it is federally mandated that any business wishing to do business with the federal government under a FAR-based contract must be registered in CCR before being awarded a contract. In addition, vendors must maintain their CCR records annually.  Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) replaces most of the paper based Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) in Section K of solicitations with an Internet application. FAR 52.204-8 mandates the use of ORCA on or after January 1, 2005.  CCR and ORCA are complementary systems. ORCA reuses data pulled from CCR and pre-populates many of the required Representations and Certifications. Then, the vendor completes the remaining Reps and Certs with the understanding that with each solicitation they are certifying to current, accurate and complete information.  You need to update ORCA at least once a year. You can update or change your Reps and Certs information whenever necessary and the 365 day clock will start over from the day of change.  Registration is simply a prerequisite before bidding on a contract.<BR><BR>

Anyone (sole proprietors, corporations, partnerships and governmental organizations) desiring to do business with the federal government must register in CCR. However, CCR registration is not required for individuals seeking grants.  By registering in CCR, you gain the ability to bid on federal government contracts. Your CCR registration does not guarantee your winning a government contract or increasing your level of business. Registration is simply a prerequisite before bidding on a contract. 
ORCA (https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx)
You must be registered in ORCA if the solicitation you are responding to requires that you have an active registration in CCR.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is the primary vendor database for the U.S. Federal Government. Since October 1, 2003, it is federally mandated that any business wishing to do business with the federal government under a FAR-based contract must be registered in CCR before being awarded a contract. In addition, vendors must maintain their CCR records annually.  Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) replaces most of the paper based Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) in Section K of solicitations with an Internet application. FAR 52.204-8 mandates the use of ORCA on or after January 1, 2005.  CCR and ORCA are complementary systems. ORCA reuses data pulled from CCR and pre-populates many of the required Representations and Certifications. Then, the vendor completes the remaining Reps and Certs with the understanding that with each solicitation they are certifying to current, accurate and complete information.  You need to update ORCA at least once a year. You can update or change your Reps and Certs information whenever necessary and the 365 day clock will start over from the day of change.  Registration is simply a prerequisite before bidding on a contract.<BR><BR>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or
division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in
performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation

responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its
intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of

documentation to support the legally changed name.

clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the
absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information
that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be
considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment"
paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual
payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment
of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in
the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments,
including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be
considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment"
paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 	(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual
confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423

Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC).  If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price.  However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offerors FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.

QUOTATION EVALUATION: 

Evaluation Factors

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price. 

Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NISTs requirements. 

As noted in the specifications, stronger consideration will be given to a system that meets the following secondary specification:

1.          Laser system shall provide the flexibility to reconfigure the ring laser to work with a dye solution, instead of a Ti:Sapphire crystal, in order to broaden its operating wavelength.
A quoted system that fails to meet the secondary specification will not be deemed technically unacceptable.

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offerors experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.

Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.  

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. DESCRIPTION:  The solicitation number W91YTV-10-R-0020.  This acquisition is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through  the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-43.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is: 325416 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This requirement is UNRESTRICTED. To be delivered to: Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Bldg 300, East Hospital Road, Fort Gordon, GA 30905 on or before September 30, 2010. FOB Destination (FOB: Origin IAW FAR 52.247-29, if delivery/transporation charges apply). The Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Gordon, GA has a requirement for the following:ITEM 0001: Flexar FX15 UHPLC Platform QTY: 1 Unit price:______amount:_____  CAT#: NFLR0215. The Flexar FX-15 UHPLC Platform consists of a Flexar FX-15 UHPLC pump and Flexar Solvent Manager with 3- channel degasser. The platform includes all pre-cut, pre-bent narrow-bore tubing (SS and PEEK), fittings and connectors to assemble an FX-15 UV/VIS, PDA, RI, FL, UV/VIS-FL or UV/VIS-RI detection system. The Flexar FX-15 UHPLC Pump is a dual-reciprocating binary pump, with four 15 micro-L displacement pistons, housed in a single ergonomic package. Operation at up to 18,000 psi (1,241 bar) across the whole flow range (1UL/min- 5 ml/min), assures that high mobile phase linear velocity and excellent separation efficiency can be achieved with sub-2 m columns used for UHPLC applications. Flow increments in 1L/min steps up to 1 ml/min and 10UL/min from 1.1 ml/min to 3 ml/min. Exclusive ultra-high pressure pulse dampeners and high-pressure titanium-  tipped check valves deliver exceptionally pulse-free flow. Innovative T-check valve prevents channel-to-channel crosstalk for high compositional accuracy. Integrated recirculating piston wash function extends maintenance-free operation by  keeping precision pump pistons clean.

A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

Also note, that at the 252"; lift height requested the machine is only capable of lifting 3500 lbs where as our machine will be able to lift 4500 lbs @ 264".
RESPONSE:The machine needs to lift the capacity of 6613 but the capacity @ 264" will be fine. So, not good for the first, but fine for the second concern. .<BR><BR>

ORCA (https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx)
You must be registered in ORCA if the solicitation you are responding to requires that you have an active registration in CCR.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is the primary vendor database for the U.S. Federal Government. Since October 1, 2003, it is federally mandated that any business wishing to do business with the federal government under a FAR-based contract must be registered in CCR before being awarded a contract. In addition, vendors must maintain their CCR records annually.  Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) replaces most of the paper based Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) in Section K of solicitations with an Internet application. FAR 52.204-8 mandates the use of ORCA on or after January 1, 2005.  CCR and ORCA are complementary systems. ORCA reuses data pulled from CCR and pre-populates many of the required Representations and Certifications. Then, the vendor completes the remaining Reps and Certs with the understanding that with each solicitation they are certifying to current, accurate and complete information.  You need to update ORCA at least once a year. You can update or change your Reps and Certs information whenever necessary and the 365 day clock will start over from the day of change.  Registration is simply a prerequisite before bidding on a contract.<BR><BR>

Offeror should disregard these tables as they are for internal purposes.

The contractor will be responsible for making direct payments for all of the above.  However, only the indirect cost percentage fee is requested in the pricing table.

2.	If so, how will these costs be covered?  Are they billed directly to LOC as cost reimbursable ODCs?  Or will the offeror be required to provide a firm fixed price for these items as support for each event is requested? 

All costs are billed to the contractor and the contractor bills the Library.  The offeror will not be required to provide a firm fixed price for direct costs for each event.

3.	Is it LOCs expectation that the offerors cost proposal will only consist of staff labor rates and company Indirect Rates?

Yes, only what was requested in the pricing table.

Additionally, B.3 Price/Cost - the pricing table requests the burdened cost for each labor category.  How should the ODC's be estimated in proposal budget?

NO
11.	How frequently (i.e, what percent?) do events involve more than just one non-English language?  At such events, will interpretation services need to be provided?
