<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for a Performance and Safety Investigation of Emergency Backup Batteries and Battery Charging Systems for Underground Mining Applications.
During an underground coal mine emergency, electrical utility power to underground workings may be disrupted by physical damage due to roof falls or explosions, or due to regulatory requirements to turn off power under circumstances such as high methane levels or ventilation interruption.  The MINER Act however, requires that mine-wide communications systems vital to the escape, survival, and rescue of workers, must continue to operate in a post-accident environment.  Other vital systems such as atmospheric monitoring systems and personnel tracking systems should also continue to provide information vital to informed emergency-conditions decision making.
	Central to fulfilling the MINER Act requirement to provide continuous emergency mine communications (and other systems), even with a loss of mine electrical power, is the issue of battery backup power.  Communications systems components should be hardened to survive the initial event and will be designed to provide readily available two way communications between trapped workers and rescue personnel.  Battery power for person-carried radios, leaky feeder system fixed components, fixed wireless mesh nodes, fixed tracking system waypoints, etc. must allow sufficient time for rescue, and be supplied in a manner appropriate for the potentially explosive mine atmosphere.
	In order to meet the above requirements, existing and potential problems with primary and backup batteries, as well as battery charging systems, must be addressed.  Background information and guidance crucial to developing strategies and concepts for effective, safe use of battery power in underground mines will come from a variety of sources, including NIOSH, MSHA, state agencies, mine operators, rescue team personnel, equipment and battery manufacturers, and companies developing new communication and personnel tracking systems in response to the MINER Act.  Extensive interaction with NIOSH contractors working on communications and tracking systems is anticipated.
This project shall investigate critical aspects of battery selection, use, and charging for the underground coal mining environment, specifically as they relate to communications with, evacuation of, and, if needed, rescue of miners in the event of an emergency.  It will ultimately conceptualize potential solutions for primary and/or backup battery systems that offer hazardous area safety (i.e. use in explosive atmospheres), survivability, adequate post-accident operating time, and are practical as well as cost effective.

The length of this CLS effort is six (6) years with four (4)  1 year option, for a total of a ten year effort, involving approximately 1100 RT repairs per year. The CLS effort consists of depot repair effort to include: inspe ction, diagnosis, and troubleshooting, testing, verifying functionality to restore the end items and repairable subassemblies or equivalents to serviceable condition. The CLS effort shall also upgrade, revise, and process logistics data and requirements as  applicable, and perform other tasking as required, to successfully support the fielded EPLRS RT radios. The functional capabilities for which the end item was designed will not be changed, modified, or altered. The functional configuration will also not be changed, modified, or altered during repair unless directed by a Government approved Engineering Change Proposal (ECP). The CLS effort shall provide depot repair for all Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) hardware and ensure that all GFE remains in se rviceable condition. The CLS effort shall perform the minimum required to return any GFE equipment to a serviceable condition for its intended operational use. The CLS effort shall repair end items received from authorized users in the United States Army ( USA), the United States Air Force (USAF) and Air National Guard (ANG), the United States Marine Corps (USMC), and any other authorized Government agencies in other US military services. The CLS effort shall then return serviceable replacement end items wit hin a repair turn-around-time (TAT) of thirty (30) days from the induction of said item into the Contractors facility, thru the Army Standard Supply System repair process. The repair process also utilizes <BR>Commercial Asset Visibility (CAV) which allows the Government to monitor the rate of stock usage at the contractors plant and assist in preventing zero stock balance availability. TAT measurement will begin upon the contractors receipt of the repairable item accompanied by a properly executed DD Form  1149, or equivalent, and end upon placement of item into Depot stock. Special shipping support will be provided by the contractor to establish a worldwide express address to support all customers including outside of continental United States (OCONUS). Th e contractor shall obtain all necessary customs and other government authorizations, licenses, and permits to ship equipment to, and receive equipment from any OCONUS location. Identification of the proposed location or locations of depot maintenance suppo rt must be provided to the Government in response to this sources sought notice. In addition to the above described repair services, the Government requires field service representative (FSR) support,  management of design changes and ECPs as directed by t he Government, and perform hardware upgrade and retrofit of fielded systems, which for DOD now number  in  total RTs in the field of over 19,000.  Note that the Government only owns performance specifications for the RT, and the RT internal drawings/design /repair procedures are proprietary to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM)  Raytheon Company. The performance specification for the latest production configuration of the EPLRS can be emailed to interested parties by contacting Mr. Victor Pinlac, (73 2) 532-5467, Fax 732-532-9135, E-mail: victor.pinlac@conus.army.mil or Ms Lynda Macdonald, IMS, Comm 732-532-4189, FAX  732-532-9135, email, Lynda.MacDonald@conus.army.mil, Lynda.MacDonald@us.army.mil.

NETSAFA's international training sites are currently operational and have established curricula.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to QinetiQ North America 7918 Jones Branch Drive, Suite 350, McLean, VA 22102 for the acquisition of services to perform an environmental impact screening study on the suitability of using the Pendine Sands Test Range in the United Kingdom for underwater test of a large (2,000 lb) explosive device. This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. NSWC PCD requires Very Shallow Water (VSW) site (15 to 40 foot water depth) that has a tidal range sufficient to permit test setup on dry land and then conduct of the test underwater.  The Pendine Sands range was selected as the most suitable candidate since the tidal variation at that site allowed for  set up of the the test on dry land, and then conduct a 18 ? 24 foot depth test at high tide. All other test range options require a longer tim!  e period to prepare (site prep or environmental assessments) with the resulting delay in program schedule and higher costs. This makes QinetiQ the only possible source that can provide the range and thus the only source to perform the required environmental study because of their unique knowledge of their facility. The items will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.   NAICS Code 541380 applies. Size standard is $11,000,000. PSC B510. Point of Contact is Don McManus at 850-235-5392, email address: donald.d.mcmanus@navy.mil.

<SOLNBR>RFQ-OH-08-00055
<RESPDATE>040208
<ARCHDATE>05022008
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Michael Kreacic, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2104
<DESC>NAICS Code: 611310   	The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, with Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Drug and Poison Information Center  to provide: (1) Continue testing the hypothesis that Poison Control Centers (PCC) are a critical piece of the pubic health component of U.S. EPA's drinking water contamination warning system; (2) To replicate and validate the methodology  developed for PCC surveillance of drinking water contamination through a PCC collaboration; (3) To pursue the adoption of the methodology by the  American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).      	The proposed Evaluation of the Role of Poison Control Centers in a Drinking Water Contamination Warning System purchase order is a component of EPA National Homeland Security  Research Center's (NHSRC) Public Health Syndromic Surveillance (PHSS) Project, an element of the Water Security Initiative (WSI).  The primary objective of the WSI is to more quickly identify drinking water contamination in order to minimize health effects. The PHSS component of the WSI includes  integration of water utility data with uses of existing public health data streams including 911 calls, emergency medical service runs, over the counter drug sales, emergency department visits, and calls to drug and poison centers. Drug and poison information center data is considered proprietary  and data is protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). 	Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Drug and Poison Information Center has developed a drinking water contamination surveillance methodology to complement the released National Poisoning  Data System (NPDS) database. This procurement seeks to continue to fund Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Drug and Poison Information Center's drinking water contamination model and replicate the model in another Poison Control Center (PCC) actively participating in the WaterSentinel  (WS) program and using the NPDS system. At this time Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Drug and Poison Information Center remains the only the pilot city for the WSI. Data are analyzed in near real time for both spatial and/or temporal trends for a specific 'drinking water'  classification. 	Preliminary work has been completed with Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Drug and Poison Information Center and the continuation of this project with Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Drug and Poison Information Center would be both cost effective and  timely.  Review of the cities participating in the Threat Ensemble Vulnerability Assessment Research Program (TEVA) for design of an early warning system yielded no regional poison control center analyzing or reporting calls indicative of a water contamination event. 	Subsequently, U. S. EPA has  determined Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Drug and Poison Information Center to be the only contractor qualified to perform the work. 	This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond  to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation  to the office identified above. Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice. Submit your request in writing to Michael Kreacic at the above address or by fax to 513-487-2107 or by e-mail to kreacic.michael@epa.gov. Telephone requests will not be  honored.

Azerbaijan: Pension Reforms Project Technical Assistance

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop technical assistance to review individually insured funded pension account systems in place in various countries and design a national pension system for Azerbaijan, while taking into account the macroeconomic impacts, the management of the accounts, the range of investment options and the administration of individual accounts. The technical assistance will also design state-funded individually insured funded pension accounts, while determining the entitlement rules/structure, how the State's portion would be valued for the individual pensioner, the timing of contributions, the legal ownership of assets, the management of the assets, and other issues. 

The Grantee, the State Social Protection Fund (SSPF), is the state agency with responsibility for social insurance and pensions in Azerbaijan. SSPF is an independent state agency that collects social insurance contributions (social security taxes on wages). Pensions are supposed to be financed by social insurance contributions. However, the social insurance contributions are not sufficient to provide for a decent pension. Therefore, for the funding of various categories of pensioners the Government of Azerbaijan allocates subsidies from the state budget.  These subsidies constitute approximately 28% of all SSPF expenses. In order to reduce dependence on the state budget, reduce poverty levels among the elderly in Azerbaijan and improve their standard of living, savings and financial support for pensions need to be increased.

With the help of the United Nations Development Program and the World Bank, SSPF has modernized much of its operations and its management information systems. However, in order to determine uses for the increasing wealth of the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) that do not have a negative macroeconomic effects, to develop a pension system that is a true safety net for the population and to give the citizens of Azerbaijan a concrete stake in their future, the SSPF desires to develop pension programs with individually insured funded pension accounts. One program would allow citizens to invest their own savings into personal accounts, similar to IRA or 401K accounts available in the United States. The structure of these accounts and their nature would be determined as part of the technical assistance. The second pension program would involve putting funding from SOFAZ into individual pension accounts. SSPF expects to implement individually insured funded pension accounts by 2010, so it is important that it determine the best pension system design for both individually insured funded pension accounts and state-funded individual accounts as soon as possible.  The Terms of Reference for this Technical Assistance include:

Task 1:  	Pension system framework
Task 2: 	Incentive elements framework
Task 3:  	Actuarial and insurance framework
Task 4:  	Investment framework for individually insured funded pensions
Task 5:  	Structure of individually insured funded pension accounts
Task 6:  	Demographic modeling
Task 7:  	Modeling impact of alternative benefit program design
Task 8: 	Review and analysis of domestic capital markets and their inclusion in the funded pension scheme
Task 9: 	Analyze alternative investment strategies and their implementation
Task 10:	Model alternative scenarios for awards to existing pensioners
Task 11:	Pension program structural and implementation issues
Task 12:	Final report (including development impact analysis)

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $511,400 Grantee cost share and a $600,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), for a total of $1,111,400.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis for the brand name with Meso Scale Discovery (MSD); 9238 Gaither Road, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20877 for  catalog number 8-5430-000021: S4-1001E-Special Grade Photometrics Series 400 Camera for the SECTOR Imager 2400.

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The salient characteristics apply to the Camera for the MSD Sector Imager 2400:  Dimensions: The instrument must fit in a 12 inch by 12 inch space.  

The following objectives are needed for the replacement camera:
1)	Peltier cooled to -25C, with a 1024x1024 pixel area. 
2)	High sensitivity camera with hardware and software control modifications to meet the required performance parameters of the instrument.  
3)	Performance parameters of the instrument.  Camera must cool to -25 C and offer	1024 x 1024 imaging pixels, which when coupled with the optics, offers 24 um 	spatial resolution
4)	Must be compatible with MSD Sector Imager 2400 existing hardware and software.

Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition:

1.	Statutory authority: Statute: 13.106-1 (b)(1)

(b)    Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

The NCI Laboratory routinely engages in proteomic research and is currently utilizing an MSD SECTOR Imager 2400 for ongoing experiments. This instrument requires a new camera for optimal performance. 

The proposed contractor, MSD, built the instrument and is the only source known for qualified parts and accessories for the MSD SECTOR 2400 due to proprietary technology within the instrument. The replacement digital camera is Peltier cooled to -25C, with a 1024x1024 pixel area. The camera is a high sensitivity camera with hardware and software control modifications to meet the required performance parameters of the instrument.  Installation of the camera requires factory trained, technology trained engineers with proprietary knowledge of the system, as well as specialized knowledge in calibration to ensure restored performance of the instrument to the manufacterers (MSD) specifications for the Sector 2400.  An example of this specialized calibration is development and recording a bit map of the digital detector for offsets and exclusion pixels. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 11:00 AM ET on April 1, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference: NCI-80053-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

ATTACHMENT 3 WARRANTY AND MAINTENANCE 2.	Defective Parts Retention. Once installed in a system at Benet Laboratories, defective parts (e.g. magnetic media, semiconductor devices, etc.) that contain any data will be retained by the Government.  The Government, at its discretion, may permit degaussing and/or declassification of such devices in accordance with approved, verifiable procedures for return to and re use/disposal by the offeror.  However, the Government reserves the right to retain these devices permanently or to destroy them, regardless of warranty or maintenance coverage for these devices. The Government shall incur no additional costs related to retention of such parts. 2.  Warranty. a.	Any provided warranty shall commence on the next day after successful completion of acceptance testing and extend at a minimum through the end of the calendar year in which the system is procured. Any maintenance (to include parts) performed prior to this date shall be furnished at no cost to the Government. b.	Prior to the expiration of the warranty period, whenever equipment is shipped for mechanical replacement purposes, the offeror shall bear all costs, including, but not limited to, costs of packing, transportation, rigging, drayage and insurance.  c.	The warranty shall not apply to maintenance required due to the fault or negligence of the Government.  3.  Hardware Maintenance.

Remedial maintenance shall be performed in accordance with the terms of the proposal.  The Principal Period of Maintenance (PPM) shall be 24 hours per day, seven days a week, including holidays. Remedial maintenance shall be required when the Governmentýýýs designated COTR, the Governmentýýýs agent, or other authorized personnel, makes an entry in the System Maintenance Event Log for Benet Labs recording that the system is not available for use, and notifies the offeror in accordance with previously established and mutually agreed to procedures.  ýýýNot available for useýýý includes degradation in system performance resulting from conditions where more than 20% of the total system capacity is unavailable, or from conditions where full system functionality is not being provided.  Examples of unavailable capacity would include, but not be limited to, inoperable processors, memory, on-line storage, network interfaces, or input/output paths/subsystems.  System functionality includes all system capabilities and operating characteristics that are normally available for use by the Benet users. When remedial hardware maintenance is required, the response time shall be within four hours. Response time begins at the time of an entry in the System Maintenance Event Log and proceeds until corrective actions are initiated by the offeror.   3.2  Preventive Maintenance. a.	The offeror shall work with Government COTR or designated representative to establish a mutually agreeable schedule for PM.  Any time for which the system is not operationally usable during a PM period will be deducted from the operational use time for the purposes of the effectiveness level calculation and will be counted as an operational interrupt at the discretion of the Government.  See Attachment 2 for additional clarification of operational use time and effectiveness level.   b.	The Government requires that all manufacturer sponsored Engineering Changes (ECs) issued prior to acceptance be incorporated into any equipment provided by the offeror.  After the date of acceptance, all future ECs and changes shall be offered to the Government by the offeror within 60 days of release by the manufacturer for production use.  Those ECs and changes required to correct safety hazards shall be offered to the Government within one dayýýýs notification to the offeror by the manufacturer that such an EC or change is available for production use. It is understood that a rejected EC may have to be accepted at a later date if it is required as a prerequisite to a future accepted EC.  The offeror shall notify the Government of all ECs prior to commencing installation of the ECs.  All manufacturer sponsored ECs, except changes required to correct safety hazards, shall be subject to approval by the Governmentýýýs COTR or designated representative prior to commencing the equipment modification.  Notification shall include a description of the EC or change, the equipment it applies to, and a recommendation as to whether or not it should be installed.  ECs and changes required to correct safety hazards shall be obtained from the manufacturer and installed in a timely manner by the offeror during periods of preventive maintenance. 4.	Software Maintenance. The offeror shall provide software maintenance, either on site, via remote diagnostics service in accordance with previously established and mutually agreed to procedures, or a combination of both, for all software provided by the offeror.

New releases shall contain all previous fixes. New releases shall be tested prior to release for general use, to ensure successful implementation when released.  Such testing shall be coordinated with the Governmentýýýs integrating contractor and performed at such times as to provide minimal user impact. c.	The offeror shall attempt to minimize the risk of loss of Government data while performing software maintenance.

<DESC>Amendment 0001: This amendment is being issued to let contractors know that CMS did not invite questions on this solicitation and will not be entertaining any. However, we will provide clarification on the point of evaluation and best value and the correct website listed in the Statement of Work as follows:

<DESC>RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING SOLICITATION FA3047-08-T-C008.


1.	The solicitation references ?pre-screen?, which is a brand name of the ferromagnetic detection (FMD) portal products manufactured by Kopp Development. Mednovus offers competing (and we believe, superior) products, but we identify them as ?Patient Sentinel? and ?Entry Sentinel?. 

RESPONSE:  The term pre-screen was not intended to be brand name specific, but rather descriptive of a two step screening process.  The first step (referred to as pre-screen) would occur at a designated walk-through passageway.  The second screening process (referred to as entry) would occur at the entry door to the magnet room.


2.	The Kopp Development FMD portals are the only fixed FMD portals that differentiate left from right in detection. There are sensitivity degradation issues which accompany the addition of left-right alarms and Mednovus has elected to not compromise sensitivity for an additional set of indicator lights. We would hope that the Air Force would consider our products, even without this ?feature.?
	
RESPONSE:  The ability to differentiate the presence of ferromagnetic material on the left versus right side of a patient was considered a highly desirable clinical feature and was thought to speed up the re-screen process.


3.	Under system requirements (p. 3 of 23), bullet point #3 calls upon the products to detect FM objects ?while ignoring all other forms of metal at a separation of 26 to 30 inches.? Is this to be the width of the portal aperture or is this a separation distance from the portal to other metal sources? 

RESPONSE:  This is the width of the portal (passageway) aperture.

4.	Under system requirements (p. 3 of 23), bullet point #4 references an attached specification of the sliding door mechanism. I did not see such a specification in the solicitation. A plan diagram of the intended site would be very helpful in this regard. 

RESPONSE: The sliding door mechanism specification is again provided as an attachment to this response.

5.	Under system requirements (p. 3 of 23), bullet point #9 calls for two remote consoles capable of ?activation and deactivation?. Is it the intention that the remote console should be capable of triggering an alarm at the portal? Or is it intended to register / display an alarm and give the operator the opportunity to reset? 

RESPONSE:  The purpose of the remote consoles is to provide notification at two distant locations when the portal or entry detectors are activated during non-duty hours.  

6.	Under Basis for Contract Award (p. 22 of 23), Technical acceptance criteria #4 indicates test criteria based on distance (x) plus increasing values. This grading is confusing to me. Is the proposer to identify a distance (x) at which the device will find a ?standard hairpin? 100% of the time and then identify the rate of positive detection at x inches plus the stated increments? Ferromagnetic detection is highly dependent on the metallurgical content of an object, its spatial orientation relative to axes of magnetization, and the object?s state of magnetization. Without a definition of such parameters, it would be very subjective (and not very helpful to the Air Force) to provide test results that could provide an inaccurate portrait of the efficacy of a FMD device.

If it would be of value to the Air Force, Mednovus would be pleased to provide one of our FMD portals for a direct head-to-head comparison against any other FMD portal vendor. We firmly believe in the superiority of our products and are quite confident that the Air Force would reach the same conclusion, as has New York Presbyterian Hospital (which has evaluated Kopp and Mednovus products side-by-side).

RESPONSE:  The intent was to allow a vendor to state their maximum separation (width of the portal) at which a normal hair pin could be detected 100% of the time.  After establishing that distance, then the vendor was asked to state the rate of positive detection at the additional stated increments.  

The option for a user test and evaluation of the products was not within the scope of this solicitation.

<DESC>This modification is issued to incorporate the minutes and sign-in sheet from the pre-submittal meeting in Atlanta, GA on March 5, 2008 as follows: Pre-Submittal Conference Minutes RFQ N5038080017 A-E Cultural Resources IDIQ South East Region The sign-in sheet listing attendees, firms, email address and telephone numbers is attached hereto. The Contract Specialist went over the requirements for submission for both Phases I and II as outlined in the FBO.  Submissions are due to the Contract Specialist by March 20, 2008 at 3:00 pm (EST).  If submissions are hand delivered, the contractor should be mindful of the building's security screening process and allow sufficient time to drop of their submissions. The NPS' Architect briefed the technical requirements as outlined in the FBO, emphasizing the contractor's responses to the Museum services requirements should be looked at in detail. The floor was opened for discussion and to address any questions the attendees had: Q.	Can you estimate how the orders will be divided? R.	This depends on how the budget comes in.  It can fluctuate, but for now we can say 50/50. Q.	What types of collection will there be for Museum Services? R.	This depends on how the budget comes in.  It can fluctuate, but for now we can say 50/50. This response subsequently added:  "Types of collections and materials may include, but are not limited to biological, book, decorative art, ethnographic, fine art, geological, magnetic media, metals, textiles, paleontological, paper, and photographic collections." Q.	A NPS employee did this work in the past.  Does the Government expect one contract person or one firm to do this work? R.	That's up to the firm, its management approach, how it will utilize its personnel.  Cost is  a factor when considering this. Q.	You require Historical Architect/Landscape reports, do you anticipate a need for an  Architect? R.	Yes. Q.	If you were to award to more than one firm, would it be by services or geographical location? R.	By services. Q.	Are you looking for one firm to provide both services? R.	That would be great; but we are accepting submissions from firms for either both or just one service. Q.	Will there be any exclusivity with the sub-consultants if proposed on more than one team. R.	We would have to consider the conflict of interest if we award to multiply firms that propose the same sub-consultant. This response subsequently added:  It is the Government's intent to award each task order in a fair and equitable manner, such as rotating the awards among the awardees.  Since it is not likely that firms would be submitting proposals for the same projects, this may not be an issue.  However, the firms under contract must ensure their consultant, if used by multiply primes, is meeting the task order requirements and delivery schedules. Q.	Does the prime have to have all of the required services or can it team up with a firm(s) that is an A-E? R.	This RFQ does allow for teaming arrangements.  The firm has to demonstrate its experience in all required areas for the entire team. The meeting was adjourned; the parties went to the job site.

<DESC>The overall goal of this solicitation is to foster new developments in Science and Technology which may ultimately lead to future operational capabilities beyond those represented by current acquisition programs and requirements.  As such, it is anticipated that successful proposals would ultimately contribute to the scientific and technological underpinning from which future Marine Corps and Combating Terrorism warfighting requirements and capabilities may become possible.  By necessity, the Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development efforts are extremely technically diverse.  As such, efforts are divided into six Thrust Areas each representing operational functions critical to Expeditionary Warfare.  Brief descriptions of ongoing efforts within the Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare thrust areas are posted at http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/30/.  Other references describing concepts for Marine Corps future warfighting include MC Strategy 21, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare Capability List, Science & Technology Strategic Plan, and Distributed Operations that can be found at https://www.mccdc.usmc.mil/.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 

INTRODUCTION

1.  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is developing its requirements and technical specifications for communication between Application Service Providers (ASPs) and the U.S. National Data Center (NDC) within the international Long-Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) system.

2.  BACKGROUND

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), at its eighty-first session in May 2006, adopted amendments to chapter V of the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) convention in relation to LRIT.  This new LRIT regulation, which entered into force on January 1, 2008, requires all ships subject to SOLAS Chapter V/19-1 to transmit LRIT information on a phased-in schedule beginning December 31, 2008. Subject to any future changes in the regulation, all U.S. flagged vessels will be required to provide their position to the U.S. NDC four (4) times daily.  The LRIT system provides for the global identification and tracking of ships.  Communication specifications within the international LRIT system detail the messaging format between LRIT components, data security throughout the network, and the protocols required for transporting data from one network point to another.  The USCG desires to assess the current industry capabilities regarding the communication specifications for the U.S. portion of the system, including message format, data security, and protocols for transporting data.

2.1 General Description of the System and Definitions

System Description:  As described in resolution MSC.210 (81), sub-section 1.2, the LRIT system consists of the following components:

1.	The shipborne LRIT information transmitting equipment

2.	The Communication Service Provider(s)

3.	The Application Service Provider(s)

4.	The LRIT Data Centre(s), including any related Vessel Monitoring 	System(s)

5.	The LRIT Data Distribution Plan

6.	The International LRIT Data Exchange

7.	LRIT Data Users.

 
2.2 LRIT System Operation

Tracking of any applicable ship begins with LRIT positional data being transmitted from the shipborne equipment.  The LRIT information transmitted includes the ship?s GNSS position (based on the WGS84 datum), time, and identification, as described in resolution MSC.210 (81).  The Communication Service Provider (CSP) provides the communication infrastructure and services necessary for establishing a communication path between the ship and the ASP.  The LRIT information transmitted from the ship will travel across the communication path set up by the CSP to the ASP.  The ASP, after receiving the LRIT information from the ship, will add additional information to the LRIT message and pass the expanded message to its associated LRIT NDC.  Functionality required for the programming and communicating of commands to the shipborne equipment is provided by the ASP.  The LRIT data, along with all the parameters added by the various LRIT components, is described in the messaging section of the MSC Communications document.  LRIT Data Centers will store all incoming LRIT information from ships instructed by their Administrations to transmit LRIT information to that Data Centre.  LRIT Data Centers will disseminate LRIT information to LRIT Data Users according to the Data Distribution Plan (DDP). The LRIT DDP will contain the information required by the Data Centers for determining how LRIT information will be distributed to the various Contracting Governments.  The DDP will contain information such as standing orders from Contracting Governments and geographical polygons relating to Contracting Governments? coastal waters, ports, and port facilities.  LRIT Data Centers will process all LRIT messages to and from the International LRIT Data Exchange (IDE).  The IDE will process all LRIT messages between LRIT Data Centers.  The IDE will route the message to the appropriate Data Center based upon the address in the message and the IP addresses in the DDP.  LRIT Data Users may be entitled to receive or request LRIT information in their capacity as a Flag State, Port State, Coastal State, or Search and rescue (SAR) services.  

2.2.1 Definitions

1.	Convention means the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended.

2.	Regulation means a regulation of the Convention.

3.	Chapter means a chapter of the Convention.

4.	LRIT Data User means a Contracting Government or a SAR service that opts to receive the LRIT information it is entitled to.

5.	Committee means the Maritime Safety Committee.

6.	High-speed craft means a craft as defined in regulation X/1.3.

7.	Mobile offshore drilling unit means a mobile offshore drilling unit as defined in regulation XI-2/1.1.5.

8.	International Routing Rules means a list of all Data Centers with their associated IP addresses as identified in the DDP.

9.	Organization means the International Maritime Organization.

10.	Vessel Monitoring System means a system established by a Contracting Government or a group of Contracting Governments to monitor the movements of the ships entitled to fly its or their flag.  A Vessel Monitoring System may also collect from the ships information specified by the Contracting Government(s) that has established it.

11.	LRIT information means the information specified in SOLAS regulation V/19-1.5.

12.	The term ?ship,? when used in the present Performance standards and functional requirements for long-range identification and tracking of ships, includes mobile offshore drilling units and high-speed craft as specified in SOLAS regulation V/19-1.4.1 and means a ship that is required to transmit LRIT information.  

Terms not otherwise defined should have the same meaning as the meaning attributed to them in the Convention.

2.2.2 Acronyms 

The acronyms that appear within this document shall have the meanings assigned to them in this Article.

1.	ASP Application Service Provider

2.	CSP Communication Service Provider

3.	DC LRIT Data Centre

4.	DDP LRIT Data Distribution Plan

5.	IDE International LRIT Data Exchange

6.	NDC National Data Centre

7.	SOLAS International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea

Communication within the LRIT System

2.3 Message Types:  Communication within the LRIT system is based upon three types of messages passing between the various components of the LRIT system:  LRIT request messages, LRIT ship position report messages, and other system messages.  Request messages are those requesting specific LRIT information.  LRIT ship position report messages are those containing LRIT ship positional data.  Other messages managed by the system include:  Billing and transaction messages, receipt messages, DDP related messages, costing and billing related messages, system status messages, and pricing messages.  Figure 2 illustrates the LRIT system components as well as the various communications segments in the LRIT network.

3.  PURPOSE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The USCG is assessing whether ASP?s can provide XML formatted data to meet our IMO MSC LRIT requirements.  In furtherance of this effort, respondents are encouraged to provide information about XML message formatting, or alternative methodologies that can help the USCG better understand the potential of exchanging positional information with U.S. flagged ships.  The USCG also wishes to know if ASP?s are capable of meeting the requirement to provide positional information for all US flagged vessels within the performance specifications set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The USCG also desires to determine the estimated period of time it will take ASP?s to have the capability to provide properly formatted data from all US vessels subject to the regulations to the US NDC.

4.  DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED

The USCG is seeking sources that are capable of producing XML formatted data to meet its IMO MSC LRIT requirements, preferably via GSA schedule contract holders.  The USCG is seeking interest and capability of firms to discuss the ASP?s capabilities with regards to the requirements discussed in this RFI, the ASP?s system requirements, the ASP?s integration specifications (if available), and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance the USCG?s understanding of the information submitted.  Respondents should also complete the Potential Requirements Table which contains provisional requirements for the USCG?s LRIT positional data requirements.  We recognize that not all requirements may be met by a single software system.  Please indicate in your response which capabilities can be provided via commercial off the shelf software versus custom developed solutions.  For requirements that are met by commercial off the shelf software, please also include the product name, release number, and release date of the software.  Please indicate the ability of your ASP to provide positional information for all US flagged vessels (or alternatively for what portion of US flagged vessels).

5.  DISCLAIMER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 10, ?Market Research?, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI, and are requested NOT to send proprietary information.  Responses indicative of proprietary information will NOT be reviewed by the USCG and returned to the Respondent.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.

6.  HOW TO RESPOND

Firms who wish to respond to this RFI should include their business size, CAGE code, Dun and Bradstreet number and GSA schedule, should they hold one.  Please submit information to include any pricing, GSA Schedule information that is applicable, comments on the specification and requirements via email to Mr. Todd W.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 

INTRODUCTION

1.  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is developing its requirements and technical specifications for communication between Application Service Providers (ASPs) and the U.S. National Data Center (NDC) within the international Long-Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) system.

2.  BACKGROUND

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), at its eighty-first session in May 2006, adopted amendments to chapter V of the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) convention in relation to LRIT.  This new LRIT regulation, which entered into force on January 1, 2008, requires all ships subject to SOLAS Chapter V/19-1 to transmit LRIT information on a phased-in schedule beginning December 31, 2008. Subject to any future changes in the regulation, all U.S. flagged vessels will be required to provide their position to the U.S. NDC four (4) times daily.  The LRIT system provides for the global identification and tracking of ships.  Communication specifications within the international LRIT system detail the messaging format between LRIT components, data security throughout the network, and the protocols required for transporting data from one network point to another.  The USCG desires to assess the current industry capabilities regarding the communication specifications for the U.S. portion of the system, including message format, data security, and protocols for transporting data.

2.1 General Description of the System and Definitions

System Description:  As described in resolution MSC.210 (81), sub-section 1.2, the LRIT system consists of the following components:

1.	The shipborne LRIT information transmitting equipment

2.	The Communication Service Provider(s)

3.	The Application Service Provider(s)

4.	The LRIT Data Centre(s), including any related Vessel Monitoring 	System(s)

5.	The LRIT Data Distribution Plan

6.	The International LRIT Data Exchange

7.	LRIT Data Users.

 
2.2 LRIT System Operation

Tracking of any applicable ship begins with LRIT positional data being transmitted from the shipborne equipment.  The LRIT information transmitted includes the ship?s GNSS position (based on the WGS84 datum), time, and identification, as described in resolution MSC.210 (81).  The Communication Service Provider (CSP) provides the communication infrastructure and services necessary for establishing a communication path between the ship and the ASP.  The LRIT information transmitted from the ship will travel across the communication path set up by the CSP to the ASP.  The ASP, after receiving the LRIT information from the ship, will add additional information to the LRIT message and pass the expanded message to its associated LRIT NDC.  Functionality required for the programming and communicating of commands to the shipborne equipment is provided by the ASP.  The LRIT data, along with all the parameters added by the various LRIT components, is described in the messaging section of the MSC Communications document.  LRIT Data Centers will store all incoming LRIT information from ships instructed by their Administrations to transmit LRIT information to that Data Centre.  LRIT Data Centers will disseminate LRIT information to LRIT Data Users according to the Data Distribution Plan (DDP). The LRIT DDP will contain the information required by the Data Centers for determining how LRIT information will be distributed to the various Contracting Governments.  The DDP will contain information such as standing orders from Contracting Governments and geographical polygons relating to Contracting Governments? coastal waters, ports, and port facilities.  LRIT Data Centers will process all LRIT messages to and from the International LRIT Data Exchange (IDE).  The IDE will process all LRIT messages between LRIT Data Centers.  The IDE will route the message to the appropriate Data Center based upon the address in the message and the IP addresses in the DDP.  LRIT Data Users may be entitled to receive or request LRIT information in their capacity as a Flag State, Port State, Coastal State, or Search and rescue (SAR) services.  

2.2.1 Definitions

1.	Convention means the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended.

2.	Regulation means a regulation of the Convention.

3.	Chapter means a chapter of the Convention.

4.	LRIT Data User means a Contracting Government or a SAR service that opts to receive the LRIT information it is entitled to.

5.	Committee means the Maritime Safety Committee.

6.	High-speed craft means a craft as defined in regulation X/1.3.

7.	Mobile offshore drilling unit means a mobile offshore drilling unit as defined in regulation XI-2/1.1.5.

8.	International Routing Rules means a list of all Data Centers with their associated IP addresses as identified in the DDP.

9.	Organization means the International Maritime Organization.

10.	Vessel Monitoring System means a system established by a Contracting Government or a group of Contracting Governments to monitor the movements of the ships entitled to fly its or their flag.  A Vessel Monitoring System may also collect from the ships information specified by the Contracting Government(s) that has established it.

11.	LRIT information means the information specified in SOLAS regulation V/19-1.5.

12.	The term ?ship,? when used in the present Performance standards and functional requirements for long-range identification and tracking of ships, includes mobile offshore drilling units and high-speed craft as specified in SOLAS regulation V/19-1.4.1 and means a ship that is required to transmit LRIT information.  

Terms not otherwise defined should have the same meaning as the meaning attributed to them in the Convention.

2.2.2 Acronyms 

The acronyms that appear within this document shall have the meanings assigned to them in this Article.

1.	ASP Application Service Provider

2.	CSP Communication Service Provider

3.	DC LRIT Data Centre

4.	DDP LRIT Data Distribution Plan

5.	IDE International LRIT Data Exchange

6.	NDC National Data Centre

7.	SOLAS International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea

Communication within the LRIT System

2.3 Message Types:  Communication within the LRIT system is based upon three types of messages passing between the various components of the LRIT system:  LRIT request messages, LRIT ship position report messages, and other system messages.  Request messages are those requesting specific LRIT information.  LRIT ship position report messages are those containing LRIT ship positional data.  Other messages managed by the system include:  Billing and transaction messages, receipt messages, DDP related messages, costing and billing related messages, system status messages, and pricing messages.  Figure 2 illustrates the LRIT system components as well as the various communications segments in the LRIT network.

3.  PURPOSE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The USCG is assessing whether ASP?s can provide XML formatted data to meet our IMO MSC LRIT requirements.  In furtherance of this effort, respondents are encouraged to provide information about XML message formatting, or alternative methodologies that can help the USCG better understand the potential of exchanging positional information with U.S. flagged ships.  The USCG also wishes to know if ASP?s are capable of meeting the requirement to provide positional information for all US flagged vessels within the performance specifications set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The USCG also desires to determine the estimated period of time it will take ASP?s to have the capability to provide properly formatted data from all US vessels subject to the regulations to the US NDC.

4.  DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED

The USCG is seeking sources that are capable of producing XML formatted data to meet its IMO MSC LRIT requirements, preferably via GSA schedule contract holders.  The USCG is seeking interest and capability of firms to discuss the ASP?s capabilities with regards to the requirements discussed in this RFI, the ASP?s system requirements, the ASP?s integration specifications (if available), and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance the USCG?s understanding of the information submitted.  Respondents should also complete the Potential Requirements Table which contains provisional requirements for the USCG?s LRIT positional data requirements.  We recognize that not all requirements may be met by a single software system.  Please indicate in your response which capabilities can be provided via commercial off the shelf software versus custom developed solutions.  For requirements that are met by commercial off the shelf software, please also include the product name, release number, and release date of the software.  Please indicate the ability of your ASP to provide positional information for all US flagged vessels (or alternatively for what portion of US flagged vessels).

5.  DISCLAIMER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 10, ?Market Research?, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI, and are requested NOT to send proprietary information.  Responses indicative of proprietary information will NOT be reviewed by the USCG and returned to the Respondent.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.

6.  HOW TO RESPOND

Firms who wish to respond to this RFI should include their business size, CAGE code, Dun and Bradstreet number and GSA schedule, should they hold one.  Please submit information to include any pricing, GSA Schedule information that is applicable, comments on the specification and requirements via email to Mr. Todd W. Blose at todd.w.blose@uscg.mil, phone (202) 475-3205, by 12 Noon local time, Friday 21 March 2008.

<CONTACT>Walt Banko 513-247-4621 walter.banko@va.gov
<DESC>Following are questions and answers regarding this RFI: 1.   From what I understand, the National minimum ICU CIS requirements SOW is still in the process of being finalized and has not been released. Are you using this document instead? Or is this a preliminary National requirements document? Please advise. I would hope that given the comprehensiveness of this document, and the short time to respond, that we will not have to answer another, more "official" or "final" requirements document.  This is a request for information to determine the vendor capabilities and will be used towards developing a final statement of work solicit proposals. 2.  The cover letter states that vendors must use the attached Excel spreadsheet and answers must appear in the Vendor Answers section. The copy that I have does not have a Vendor Answers column. The Vendor Answers column is on the Analytics but not the other 2 spreadsheets.  Vendors should add a column to the right of Element and title that column Vendor Answers. 3.  Who installed the VA's VistA/CPRS hospital information system? (What vendor - Name and contact if possible). VA's Vista/CPRS is a home grown application developed by VA programmers. 4.  How many modules make up the VA's VistA/CPRS hospital information system? 145 5.  How many separate installations of the ICU/CIS will there be? (Number of hospitals and number of ICUs). This number has not been determined as yet. 6.  Does the VA expect a complete turnkey approach?  (Assumes no VA IT personnel involved). Some cases will be turnkey and others will involve some IT personnel involvement 7.  Additionally, is this RFI for a specific VA Medical Center, or a specific VISN or for all VAMC's nationally? This RFI is for the benefit of all the VAMC's nationwide.

<SOLNBR>08-N240-6011
<RESPDATE>033108
<CONTACT>Michele McDermott, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-1798, Fax 301-443-5462, Email mmcdermott@hrsa.gov
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to contract for services for the requirement entitled Pediatric Audiology Training.

This requirement is intended to increase didactic content and experience in pediatric audiology in both short and long term training programs for audiologists.  

About 95% of newborn infants in the US are screened for hearing loss before discharge form the nursery.  It is recommended that infants who do not pass the hospital screening be rescreened on an outpatient basis. Those infants not passing the second screen should proceed to audiologic diagnosis before they reach three months of age.   However, an acute shortage of audiolgists who are able to work with infants and their families often impedes this process.  The reasons for this are several.  Most practicing audiologists received their education and training in a time preceding implementation of newborn hearing screening, which has only become universal in the last few years.  Additionally, pediatric diagnostic audiology requires significantly more time than service to an adult and is poorly reimbursed by both public and private payors.  Special equipment is also required for an array of diagnostic tests.  In fact, only half of the infants referred are generally evaluated, due in part to the shortage of personnel and equipment.  Data show that an infant with a significant hearing impairment who receives intervention by six months of age will perform significantly better in language and social development than the infant who is identified after six months of age.  Education and training of additional personnel at the preservice level as well as continuing education for practicing audiologists will mitigate the problem

Specifically, this contractor will assist the Federal Newborn Hearing Screening and Intervention Program and its grantees in the following areas:

1.  Meeting family needs for timely access to quality pediatric diagnostic audiology services.

2.  Dissemination of the pediatric diagnostics curricula nationwide through distance learning networks, the National Center for Hearing Assessment and Management and the Association of University Centers for Developmental Disabilities.   

Contractor will be required to produce the following deliverables:

1.  Sample curricula suitable for use in a conventional classroom/clinical setting and in a distance learning mode. 

2.  Technical Assistance to audiology training programs including telephone and in-person consultation as is needed and feasible.
 
3.  Quarterly progress reports containing information on services provided under the contract.

Qualified contractors must satisfy the following minimum requirements.  Provide a detailed description of your company's experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver each and every one (address each separately) of the following requirements:  

1.  Demonstrated familiarity with the issues surrounding limited access to timely and appropriate access to infant diagnostic audiology services. 

2.  Experience in the field of in the field of public health with a focus on areas of maternal and child health concerns, specifically a knowledge of issues affecting infants with special health care needs and their families.

3.  Awareness of cultural diversity and it's effect on utilization of health services.

4.  Demonstrated ability to work with audiology students in a manner which supports the goals of the Federal Universal Newborn Hearing Screening and Intervention Program.

A cost plus fixed fee type contract is anticipated, for three years dependent on the availability of funds.  

Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required.  Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the tasks described above at a sufficient level of detail to allow definitive numerical evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ("Limitations on Subcontracting").  Failure to definitively address each of these factors will result in a finding that respondent lacks capability to perform the work.

1.  Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.

2.  Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.

3.  Business size for NAICS 541690 ($6.5M) and status, if qualified as an 8(a) firm (must be certified by SBA), Small Disadvantaged Business (must be certified by SBA), Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZone firm (must be certified by SBA), and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages).

4.  DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.).  Companies also must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR, at www.ccr.gov) to be considered as potential sources.

5.  Identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and contract number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are also requested.

6.  If the company has a Government approved accounting system, please identify the agency that approved the system.

Please submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firm's status (see item #3, above).  Teaming arrangements are acceptable, and the information required above on the company responding to this announcement, should also be provided for each entity expected to be teammates of the respondent for performance of this work.

To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information.  Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.

This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement.

<SUBJECT>R -- Technical Support for Medicare Advantage Contracting and Business Process Improvements Related to Contracting Automation
<SOLNBR>80857
<RESPDATE>040108
<ARCHDATE>04162008
<CONTACT>Heather Robertson, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-6888, Fax 410-786-9088, Email heather.robertson@cms.hhs.gov - Mark Smolenski, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-0175, Fax 410-786-9088, Email MSmolenski@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses on the GSA MOBIS Schedule (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide technical support for Medicare Advantage Contracting (i.e. Submitted applications and bid review) and business process improvements related to contracting automation. 

History:  For over thirty years, managed care organizations have had the opportunity to participate in the Medicare program by offering Medicare beneficiaries original Medicare benefits (and generally additional benefits beyond that) in exchange for a monthly capitated payment from CMS. Managed care plan participation in Medicare has varied based upon a variety of factors, but has trended up for the last three years since the creation of the Medicare Advantage program.  Barring substantial legislative change, managed care participation in Medicare through Medicare Advantage is expected to continue to increase.  Since the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) in  2003, prospective Medicare Advantage contractors have submitted applications and bids to CMS and received contract approval based upon an annual calendar rather than on a flow basis.  

The considerable growth in the Medicare Advantage program since the passage of MMA has substantially increased workload associated with processing, reviewing, and ultimately approving/disapproving applications.  This workload increase has further been complicated by numerous new product types within the Medicare Advantage program - Regional Preferred Provider Organizations, Medical Savings Accounts, Private Fee for Service Plans, Employer Group Plans, and Religious and Fraternal Benefit Organizations.  The workload associated with processing Notices of Intent (NOI), Applications, Bids, considering appeals of disapprovals, preparation for hearings, and issuing initial contracts and service area expansion notices spikes and dissipates throughout the contract year.  CMS is seeking a contractor to assist with many facets of the contracting workload.  In addition, for the first time in 2008, Medicare Advantage organizations will be submitting applications electronically, and CMS seeks a contractor to assist CMS with adjusting work processes to fully capitalize on this automation.

Purpose:  CMS is seeking to determine if there are small businesses capable of supporting CMS with its Medicare Advantage contracting (submitted applications and bid review) workload.  In general, these services will be provided intermittently and for a short duration of time.  Generally, CMS will be able to present the contractor with a calendar that will allow the contractor to ?ramp up? for work-spikes with reasonable notice.  However, CMS will also need a contractor that can augment or decrease resources on short notice.  
In particular, the contractor shall need to provide CMS with: 

1. Highly skilled individuals with necessary skills including but not limited to actuarial, clinical, legal, and statistical; 
2. Clerical individuals to conduct data-entry, filing, and other clerical and sub-professional activities; and
3. Business process consulting to examine present CMS work processes and implement tactical work process improvement strategies.  

Task Descriptions:  The Contractor shall provide the following services based upon the following approximate calendar with the month of April as the starting point (the projections offered below are subject to change):

1.  Application Review Support (April-May): Provide intermittent, expert technical assistance to CMS in reviewing contract applications, particularly with respect to assisting CMS Regional Office staff in: 
a.  Examining Health Service Delivery table submissions by 
investigating provider network adequacy and conducting outbound calling to samplings of listed providers to confirm their participation; 
b.   Reviewing selected provider contracts to assure compliance with CMS standards; and 
c.  Going on-site to new applicant office for related review work. 

2.	Reconsideration/Appeals Support (May-July): Provide intermittent expert technical assistance to CMS in documenting disapproved applications, assembling documentation for reconsideration/appeals processes, and maintaining a database (under direction of CMS) of denied applications with germane related information. 

3.	Bid Support (April-September): Bid and financial reviews occur between the months of March-August and are conducted by a limited number of analysts in need of additional help to complete the timely review of bids and financial applications for CY 2009. Contractor shall assist CMS staff in filing, collating, and mailing materials.  Under CMS guidance, maintain existing database related to bids.  

4.	Contract Issuance (September-November): Provide support assembling contractor approval packages for executive signature, including documents related to new contracts, service area expansions, and various addendums.  Assist CMS staff in packaging and mailing materials.  Under CMS guidance, maintain existing database related to contract issuance.  

5.	Notices of Intent (December-January): Provide data-entry support for logging in Notices of Intent from prospective Medicare Advantage applicants for CY 2010.  Provide ad hoc assistance to CMS in establishing new contract numbers and related functions.  

6.	Data Extraction and Reporting (ad hoc): Over the course of the year, provide intermittent and ad hoc support to CMS staff related to extracting data from various application, bid, and contracting materials.  

7.	Business Process Improvement (intermittent):  Over the course of the year,provide intermittent and ad hoc business process improvement consulting designed to improve CMS work processes, particularly as CMS transitions from a paper-bound contract application to a paperless one.  Consulting services shall be tactical, not strategic, in nature and designed to address task-specific work challenges.  

Contractor Requirements:  In order to respond to this notice, contractors must be able to indicate experience and/or the ability to provide all of the numbered points below.  Please provide enough detail so your response clearly indicates that you can provide the following:   

1.  Knowledge of Medicare Program:  The Contractor shall demonstrate an understanding of the Medicare program related to: Medicare Advantage, Federal and DHHS contracting processes and regulations, and CMS organization and organizational culture.

2.  Knowledge of Managed Care Operations: The Contractor shall possess an understanding of managed care contracting, provider network development, different managed care models, and provider contracting.

3.  Access to Requisite Skills: The Contractor shall demonstrate that it has on staff or via reliable business partners the full skill-sets and flexible human resources described above.

4.  Demonstrated Success on Similar Projects:  The Contractor shall demonstrate that it has provided intermittent support of a similar nature to other government agencies.

5.  Business Process Improvement:  The Contractor shall demonstrate that is has successfully assisted other government agencies in improving their work processes based upon advances created by Information Technology.

6.  No Conflicts of Interest: The Contractor shall demonstrate that it does not have any current relationships with organizations that participate in the Medicare Advantage program or have other relationships which would compromise the integrity of the program. 

Examples to help contractors determine Conflict of Interest:
The following shows situations that highlight potential or actual conflict of interest. For example, CMS anticipates that a contractor may have actual, apparent or perceived conflicts of interest with the work performed under a hypothetical contract: the operation or sale of managed care plans, Medigap policies, durable medical equipment, dialysis services, or any other related provider groups, products or services; sale of products or services targeted at populations covered by Medicare, e.g., retirement time-share vacations. The following paragraphs illustrate situations in which questions concerning conflicts of interest may arise. These situations are not inclusive, but are intended to help contractors identify their own organizational conflicts of interest.

1.	Contractor A operates and sells managed care plans in the state of Delaware.  Under this contract, Contractor A is required to provide names, telephone numbers and other plan information about managed care in the state of Delaware.

2.	Contractor B sells a variety of Medigap policies nationwide.  Under this contract, Contractor B is required to assist Medicare beneficiaries in determining gaps in their Medicare coverage.  Contractor B is also required to provide the names and telephone numbers of Medigap policy providers.  

3. 	Contractor C - A Durable Medical Equipment Supplier markets wheel chairs. Under this contract, Contractor C may assist beneficiaries in answering questions concerning the equipment and where they may obtain such items.

4. 	Contractor D performs telemarketing to sell vacation properties. Under this contract, Contractor D will have access to data on beneficiaries that could be used for mailing lists and phone listings that would enable Contractor D?s telemarketing division to target that population. 

Capability Submissions:  

Capability statements shall also include the following business information:
a. DUNS
b. Company Name 
c. Company Address 
d. Company Point of Contact, phone number and email address
e. Type of company under NACIS: 541611-Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services (Size Standard: $6.5 million), as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  All offerors must register on the CCR located at http://www.ccr.gov/index.asp.   
f. Current GSA Schedules appropriate to this Sources Sought 
g. Point of Contact, phone number and email address of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.

<CONTACT>Donald Hafer, Contracting Officer, 304-285-1390, jodi.collins@netl.doe.gov;Jodi Collins, Contract Specialist, 304-285-1390, jodi.collins@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources capable of providing specialized engineering services to perform a design/build requirement for a Fuel Flexible Gasification System. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and NO contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.  The Contractor shall provide all facilities, supervision, personnel, tools, equipment, and services to perform the contract requirements (a specified area at the NETL Morgantown, WV site will be available for constructing and testing of the gasification system). The U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory is developing Coal/biomass co-gasification technology to reduce the overall CO2 emissions associated with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power production.  Coal/biomass mixture gasification presents many unique challenges.  Individually, coal and biomass gasifiers are not easily adapted to support the co-gasification of coal/biomass mixture materials and define their physical and chemical behavior under high pressure and high temperature gasification conditions.  To accomplish this, the construction of a small-scale, readily operated fuel flexible gasifier is necessary to generate char, tar, slag, and syngas samples to test process concepts, validate computer models, develop diagnostic tools, and screen the relative gasification behavior of coal/biomass mixture feedstocks. The objective of this requirement is to have a contractor design a high temperature, high pressure fuel flexible gasification system (designed to the operational parameters provided by DOE/NETL) suitable for kinetic experiments. Upon acceptance of the design elements, the contractor would then be required to fabricate the fuel flexible gasification system, install at NETL-MGN, test and operate the system demonstrating its operational functionality within the specified parameters provided, prepare operational manuals and train DOE/NETL personnel to operate and maintain the gasification system.  The fabrication portion of this requirement would include an expressed warranty/performance guarantee as to the operation of the designed system. 1. Interested business concerns must provide detailed descriptions of capability and demonstrated past experiences addressing the design and construction of complex gasification systems. 2. If subcontracting is anticipated, demonstrated experience in successfully managing subcontracts and a detailed description of how the Contractor guarantees the performance and participation of the potential subcontractor. 3. Include your business size as it relates to the above stated NAICS code and size standard information listed. All interested parties responding to this market survey must submit their responses through via the Department of Energy Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on April 2, 2008. The IIPS page is located at http://e-center.doe.gov .  At this Internet site you will be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to submit your response. Your response should be submitted using the ýýýCreate Proposalýýý function in IIPS.  The respondent must then complete the required fields and attach their response to the link identified as ýýýAttach Volume I/Offer or Other Documentsýýý. For consistency, the respondent is instructed to submit their response in either ýýýMS Wordýýý (.doc) or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format. If you need technical assistance in registering or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or email the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov. As indicated previously, this is not a solicitation therefore no cost or pricing information should be provided.  This is a market survey to identify potential sources capable of performing the effort required.  Responses should be limited to the Contractors expression of interest, identification of business size, and demonstration of capabilities/experience based on the list provided.

The Integrator for Laboratory Process Units to be acquired will support the construction of a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) to be built at the Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Site (SRS).  

The Integrator for Laboratory Process units is Quality Level 1 (QL-1) and will be purchased under a Supply Subcontract.  The MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) will produce completed Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel assemblies for use in domestic, commercial nuclear power reactors.  The MFFF design for the United States will be licensed by the NRC, ensuring compliance with the most stringent design standards.  The NRC regulations are found in Chapter I of Title 10, "Energy", of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  10 CRF 50 - Appendix B, Quality Assurance Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants and Fuel Reprocessing Plants, will be applicable to this procurement.

The MFFF is a multi-functional complex containing all of the plutonium handling, fuel processing, and fuel fabrication operations. The MOX Fuel Fabrication Building (BMF) is a multi-story, hardened reinforced concrete structure enclosing approximately 441,000 sq. ft.  The MFFF Laboratory within the BMF is utilized to perform physical and chemical analyses of samples coming from production units located in the MOX Process (MP) and the Aqueous Polishing (AP) areas of the facility.  Samples are conveyed throughout the laboratory to various Process Units via a pneumatic transfer system (provided by MOX Services). The MP and AP laboratory areas of the MFFF occupy approximately 20,000 sq. ft.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT -  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) Industry Capabilities for the Production of Global Broadcast Service (GBS) Systems 1.0   DESCRIPTION 1.1   The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of the Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (PEO C4I), Communications Program Office (PMW/A 170) is seeking industry information on the production of Global Broadcast Service (GBS) systems and technical refresh kits to be installed in obsolescing GBS systems affected by Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts obsolescence. 1.2   THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes ýýý it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partyýýýs expense.  Small businesses having the capabilities to perform the tasking below are encouraged to reply to this RFI.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If an RFP is issued, it will be synopsized on the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://www.fbo.gov and the SPAWAR e- Commerce Central website at https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement. 2.0   BACKGROUND PEO C4I and PMW/A 170 are responsible for the acquisition, integration, delivery and support of interoperable communications systems enabling seamless operations for the fleet, joint and coalition war fighter. GBS augments other Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) by providing a high speed, one way information flow of high volume data to users ashore, afloat or supporting special operations.  It provides the capability of quickly disseminating live video (including UAV) and large files to support joint training exercises, special activities, weapons targeting, intelligence, and reconnaissance. PEO C4I and PMW/A 170 are looking to procure Shipboard GBS Systems ýýý AN/USR-10 (v), including both variants: Subsurface Receive Suites (SSRSs) (v 1/2/3) and Shipboard Receive Suites (SRSs) (v 4/5).  The procurement will include the conversion of shipboard Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Low Data Rate (LDR) antennas to GBS antennas according to the specifications for the GBS Shipboard Antenna Systems (SASs) ýýý OE-581 Antenna Group.  GBS is also procuring technical refresh kits to upgrade current fielded GBS below-deck systems affected by COTS obsolescence. 2.1   CURRENT GBS SYSTEMS 2.1.1       GBS Below-Deck Systems The current PMW/A 170 afloat GBS system in service is the AN/USR-10 (v) ýýý with a Subsurface Receive Suite (SSRS) variant and Shipboard Receive Suite (SRS) variant.  The OE-581 Shipboard Antenna System (SAS) is an integral part of the SRS (AN/USR-10 (v 4/5)) configuration. The AN/USR-10 (v) systems (SSRS/SRS) are designed to receive GBS satellite transmissions within the Super High Frequency (SHF) spectrum, currently using only the Ka-band.  The submarine variants contain two major assemblies:  the Submarine High Data Rate (SUB-HDR) Antenna System (OE- 562) and USR-10 (v 1/2/3).  The OE- 562 is not GBS unique equipment, but a common antenna which GBS does not acquire or support.  The OE-562 is not covered by this RFI.  The surface variants contain two major assemblies: the OE-581 antenna and the AN/USR- 10 (v 4/5).  The AN/USR-10 (v)4 uses a dual antenna for large combatant and command ships, and the AN/USR- 10 (v)5 uses a single antenna in smaller combatants. The current GBS systems are delineated below: ýýý     AN/USR-10 (v)1 Los Angeles Class Submarines (Units 1-6) ýýý     AN/USR-10 (v)2 Seawolf/Virginia Class Submarines (Units 4 & 5) ýýý     AN/USR-10 (v)3 Ohio Class Submarines (Units 4, 5, & 6) ýýý     AN/USR-10 (v)4 Dual Antenna CV/N, LCC, LHA/D Type (Units 1-7) ýýý     AN/USR-10 (v)5 Single Antenna CG/DDG Type (Units 1-6) All units are vendor environmentally qualified to meet both Surface and Submarine requirements in shock (MIL- STD-2036, MIL-STD-810, MIL-STD- 901D Grade B), vibration (MIL-STD-167 Type 1), Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) (MIL-STD-461/462D), altitude transport, temperature and humidity, AC power DOD-STD-1399, airborne, and structureborne noise MIL-STD-740- 1. 2.1.2       GBS Shipboard Antenna System (SAS) ýýý OE-581 Antenna Group The OE-581 is a receive-only, shipboard satellite communications antenna group operating at Ka-band frequencies.  The antenna automatically acquires and tracks satellites in geosynchronous orbit while subjected to environmental conditions. The OE-581 is installed as either a single or dual antenna configuration. The OE-581 includes antennas, tracking receiver function, antenna controller function, low-noise block converter, power distribution and other ancillary equipment.  The OE-581 also provides an operator interface unit for operations and maintenance tasks. The procurement will involve the conversion of shipboard EHF LDR antennas to GBS antennas in accordance with the OE-581 specifications.  Upon completion of the antenna conversions, new OE-581 systems will be procured. 2.1.3       GBS Diagram Figure 1 provides a high level diagram of the GBS shipboard system. Figure 1 ýýý GBS System AN/USR-10 (v)4 2.2   PLANNED PRODUCTION The Government  estimates a potential need for approximately 10 USR-10 (v) 1; 97 USR-10 (v 4/5); 60 OE-581 antenna conversions; and 37 new OE- 581 antennas.  The Government will also need 94 technical refresh kits. 2.3   DELIVERY PERIOD Production will occur over five (5) years.  The earliest anticipated delivery date is April 2009 for: 10 USR-10 (v)1; 17 USR-10 (v)5; 21 OE-581 conversions; and 80 technical refresh kits.  The remaining 80 USR-10 (v 4/5) systems and 14 technical refresh kits will be procured over the subsequent four years.  The need for follow-on OE- 581 procurements/conversions beyond FY09 is under review. 3.0  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION (GFI) The following GFI is available upon request.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR>---------------<BR>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>	Europe Region seeks approval to initiate the standardization process for IV Catheters, Safety & Conventional for its 55 Army, Navy, and US Air Force me dical facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia.  Standardization for this product line, IV Catheters, Safety & Conventional, represents new or first-time initiative for the Europe Region.  This product line includes the following products in the following sizes.<BR>a.	Conventional IV Catheters sizes: 10ga 3 inches, 12ga 3 inches; 14ga 1-3/4  inches, 2-1/4  inches, 3-1/4 inches, 5-1/4 inches; 16ga 1-1/8 inches, 1-1/4 inches, 1-3/4  inches; 18ga 1-1/8 inches, 1 -1/4 inches, 18 1 inch, 1-3/4  inches, 2  inches; 20ga 1-1/8  inches, 1-1/4  inches, 1-3/4  inches, 2  inches; 22g 1 inch; 24g 3/4 inch.<BR>b.	Conventional IV Catheter Winged sizes: 18ga 1-1/4 inches; 20ga 1-1/4  inches; 24ga 5/8 inch; 19ga with 12 inch tu bing; 23ga with 12 inch tubing; 25ga with 3 inch tubing.	<BR>c.	Safety IV Catheters sizes: 14ga 1-1/4 inches, 1-3/4 inches, 2 inches; 16ga 1-1/8 inches, 1-1/4 inches, 2 inches; 18ga 1-1/8 inches, 1-1/4 inches; 20ga 1 inch, 1-1/8 inches, 1-1/4  inches; 22ga  1 inch; 24ga 1/2 inch, 3/4 inch.<BR>d.	Safety IV Catheter Winged sizes: 14ga 2 inches; 16ga 1-1/4  inches; 18ga 1-1/8 inches, 1-1/4 inches; 20ga 1 inch, 1-1/8  inches, 1-1/4 inch, 22ga 1 inch, 24ga 1/2 inch, ? inch.<BR>Vendors are required to supply all i tems listed in all sizes listed. <BR><BR>	The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>	The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity He idelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Az ores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. Army CENTCOM.<BR><BR>	This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pu rsuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program, and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>	The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with t hree (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined,  are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selecti on of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR>  <BR>B.

Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>	DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil  all e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  Please ensure that all communications of sign ificant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) will be digitally signed. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal d eadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>	This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due  to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested informati on has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first sub mission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Regi on. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>	The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or pro duct lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this an nouncement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the righ t to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient comp etition among vendors.<BR><BR>	Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor responses, th e TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The respon ses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participat e in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1. In general acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a. The business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete lin e of the subject medical/surgical consumables.<BR>b. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such produ cts or services.<BR>c. The vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>d. The vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor (PV) for the r egion (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified).<BR>e. The vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to provide a discount from  DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore National FSS prices do not represent a discount off DAPA.<BR>f. The vendors informa tion provided is factually correct.<BR>2. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR> <BR>1.

NOTE: All vendors must send TRBO POC verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scal e, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance crite ria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores an d how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standard ization initiative.   <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-cl inical (non-patient) setting.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR> <BR>Vendor products meet the Clinically Acceptable Target Threshold of 3.00<BR><BR>1.	Packaging ident ifies the gauge and length of the catheter (safety in urgent 				care setting)<BR>a.	Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to select the appropriate size for patient care needs<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<BR>2.	The catheter allows visualization of flashback (clinical efficiency)<BR>	a.   Allows additional confirmation clinician has entered the vein<BR>	b.   This criterion will be eva luated 4 times by each participating MTF using 			each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<BR>3.	The catheter hub is Luer-Lock compatible to secure tubing (patient safety)<BR>	a.   Prevents tubing from accidental disconnects<BR> 	b.   This criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF using 			each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<BR>4.	The catheter sheath moves freely on the needle to facilitate cannulation 				(patient comfort)<BR>	 a.   Causes less manipulation at insertion site<BR>	b.   This criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF using 			each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<BR>5.	The safety feature (if applicable) is an integra l part of the device, activates 			automatically and is not an accessory. (clinician safety)<BR>	a.   Prevention of accidental needle stick<BR>	b.   OSHA preven tion of Blood borne pathogen standard<BR>	c.   This criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF using 			each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<BR>6.	The safety feature (if applicable) allows or requires the workers hands to 				remain behind the needle at all times. (clinician safety)<BR>	a.   Prevention of accidental needle stick<BR>	b.

This criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF using 			each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<BR><BR>	Phase III - Pricing Analysi s Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered ne ar the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total  Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be p rovided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive d iscounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the E urope Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation  results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The  following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines<BR>3.	Consideration of s tock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor<BR>Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.<BR>

<DESC>Description (Request for Information)
The United States Special Operation Command (USSOCOM) is conducting a request for information for senior advisor services with experience in technical areas of concern to SOCOM.  The advisor, must possess a doctoral degree in Engineering and must have served in an advisory role to other senior military commands.  The advisor/firm must possess an in depth understanding of Insensitive Munitions (IM) and newly developed or product improved non nuclear munitions, as required by MIL STD 2105C.  The advisor/firm must have a working knowledge of the process involved in developing IM insensitive systems, which will reduce collateral damage in the event of an accident from unplanned stimuli.
The advisor/firm must be a recognized expert in this area and articulate with the Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Panel and the DOD Integrated Program Team (IPT) panels.  Advisor/firm must have experience in writing and assembling a Strategic Plan.  Advisor/firm must have knowledge of all munitions in the SOCOM Fiscal Year Defense Program (FYDP), and their susceptibility to IM stimuli.
Since munitions contain explosives, propellant and fuzes, the applicant/firm must have a working knowledge of insensitive explosives.  The applicant/firm must be capable of showing through publications for International Conferences and peer groups, their ability to design and develop propellant venting technologies as applied to high and mid caliber artillery guns.
Since fuzes are an integral part of insensitive munitions, the advisor/firm must possess a working knowledge of fuzing systems for mortars, artillery, rockets, bombs, grenades and other explosive devices.
Specific knowledge of power sources, both chemical and non-chemical is required to evaluate systems adherence to MIL STD 1316.  In many cases, the fuze is the road block in achieving IM compliance for a munition; the advisor must then propose new fuze designs to make the munition safer and become IM compliant.  Electronic/mechanical arming systems must be part of the advisor?s experience.  Advisors/firms must have a working knowledge of Special Forces equipment, i.e., radio transmitters/receivers, man-powered generators and training devices as applied to the soldier worn Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) harness system.
Advisor/firm must have a long term experience of military systems having contributed to these systems by means of patents, publications, reports, and physical hardware.
Interested firms, capable of supplying this service, should provide the following information: cage code, company name, address, phone number, email address, a point of contact, business size, and type of company within NAICS  541330. 
Also, contractors shall provide specific product literature with emphasis on the advisor?s/firm?s capabilities.  General company product literature will not be considered a response.  Information shall be submitted to Kenyona Wilson, Contract Specialist at Kenyona.Wilson.ctr@socom.mil or to Denise Green-Huneke, Contracting Officer at cdenise.green-huneke@socom.mil, no later than 1400 EDT on March 24, 2008.   
This is a request or information only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  This notice shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  No entitlement to payment will arise as a result of the submission of contractor information.

<SUBJECT>D -- Effectiveness of National Biosurveillance Systems: Biowatch and Public Health System
<DESC>Congress has directed the Office of Health Affairs to sponsor an Academies project that would provide an evaluation of the effectiveness of both the current and ideal biosurveillance systems to detect biological terrorism, including (1) differing technological generations of environmental detection systems, (2) current human and animal health surveillance systems, (3) define necessary enhancements to hospital and public health based measures of effectiveness in detecting attacks of bioterrorism. In order to fulfill this requirement of the US Department of Homeland Security, Office of Procurement Operations intends to enter into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine (IOM) on a sole source basis pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-5.  The contract will be for studying effectiveness of the ability of the BioWatch program surveillance systems to sufficiently warn and provide effective post-exposure prophylaxis and effective post-infection treatment to affected populations following a bioterrorism attack.  The National Academy of Science (NAS) was established by an Act of Congress signed by President Lincoln in March 1863 to investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art ....whenever called upon by any department of the Government.  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) was chartered in 1970 by the National Academy of Science, under the terms of the 1863 Congressional Charter.  A central purpose of NAS and IOM is to advise the government on issues of science, medicine, and technology.  The Academy and its affiliated organizations are private, independent, nonprofit institutions that jointly possess a unique status as congressionally chartered advisers to the government.  The IOM has a long tradition of providing policy advice from a national perspective.  This tradition rests on the ability of the NAS/IOM to convene committees of experts who are charged to deliberate important issues of health and health care policy in an objective and independent environment that assures rigorous analysis.  IOM serves as an important function for bringing representatives from diverse groups together to achieve consensus on complex issues.  Determination by the Government whether to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The anticipated period of performance will be April 1, 2008 through September 30, 2008.  Place of performance shall be at DHS offices located in the greater Washington DC metropolitan area, or any facility that may be identified by the government.

This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires the purchase of Process Model Software.  The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to DLT Solutions Inc located at 13861 Sunrise Valley Dr STE 400, Herndon, VA 20171.  Interested parties may e-mail joseph.sherwood@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, Attn: Joseph Sherwood, not later than Friday, 21 March, 2008, 12:00 p.m. EST.
Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:
 The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

DLT is the sole distributor to the Federal Government for the requested software.  Purchasing another network management platform is not an option since Solarwinds is institutionalized at SOCOM. To replace the existing network management software with a similar product, such as HP Openview would cost the Government approximately $228,000.00. This figure assumes a cost of $38,000.00 (obtained through internet market research) and multiplied by 6 (the minimum number of licenses needed to operate).  This figure does not include the additional cost that would be required to retrain SOCOM personnel on the use of the new system, purchase additional hardware and setup the platform on 3 different networks. In summary, to purchase another brand of network management software would involve substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.

The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Primavera Inc, 9600 SW Barnes Rd, STE 300, Portland OR 97225.  Interested parties may e-mail joseph.sherwood@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, Attn: Joseph Sherwood, not later than Friday, 21 March, 2008, 12:00 p.m. EST.


Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

USSOCOM has purchased Primavera-ProSight software, and requires updates and annual maintenance support.  Primavera Systems Inc. is the sole manufacturer of the Primavera-ProSight Software and the only company providing maintenance support for the products.

The maintenance support provided by Primavera Systems, Inc. will include the current major release of the software or documentation made available during the period and access to Technical Support for trouble shooting and problem resolution while implementing releases in this period.

Although there are IT PfM software tools that exist on the market, none have the capability to provide the type of integrated tool that Primavera-ProSight provides in support of IT Portfolio Management, Project Management and Capital Planning and Investment/Earned Value management.  In addition, much of the Federal Government to include MILDEPS, COCOMs and Agencies are using Primavera-ProSight as their tool of choice, which provides increased interoperability, data synchronization, and opportunity for re-use, sharing of lessons-learned, developments, and increased synchronization of new PfM efforts at DOD level.

Purchasing comparable software from another vendor would result in substantial duplication of costs not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.  USSOCOM is implementing this software at a cost in resources to include manpower, time and training.  These costs would needed to be expended again in order to test, integrate and install any other software, application or product, as well as, the cost of personnel to gain a level of operational proficiency by USSOCOM employees.  Upfront cost for training, data synchronization/data mapping, security permissions/roles development have already been incurred, and would need to be incurred a second time from the start for purchasing/implementing/ developing new software for USSOCOM IT Portfolio Management use, and would  require the total reconfiguration of data.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 306-08-019 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The full solicitation document exceeds allowable character count for the Federal Business Opportunity Website. The information below is a summary of the solicitation. In order to provide a proposal, please request the full solicitation from the Point of Contact below. The offerors already pre-registered with USAID Regional Inspector General/Manila can receive the full solicitation. The offerors must be prequalified by USAID Regional Inspector General to be eligible for award under this solicitation. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-15.   

OBJECTIVE

The objective of the work is for an audit firm to conduct concurrent financial audits on the local costs (costs incurred and paid in Afghanistan) of LBGI/B&V Contract No. 306-I-00-06-00517 for the period from August 25, 2006, to August 24, 2011. The LBGI/B&V Contract implements USAID Afghanistan's Infrastructure Rehabilitation Program (AIRP). Concurrent audits shall be conducted on an annual basis with issuance of a separate audit report for each concurrent audit. The initial audit report will be for the period from August 25, 2006 through September 30, 2007. Subsequent reports will be done on annul basis. 

The Schedule of Local Costs Billed to USAID is the basic financial statement to be audited that presents LBGI/B&V's local costs billed to USAID, and the commodities and technical assistance directly procured by USAID for contractor's use, for the period audited.

The Auditor shall perform audits in accordance with the Statement of Work and U.S. Government Auditing Standards, and shall accordingly include such tests of the accounting records as deemed necessary under the circumstances.  The specific objectives of the audit are to:

1.	Identify as unsupported or ineligible, any questioned costs in the Schedule of Local Costs Billed to USAID for the period audited in conformity with the terms of the contract/task order and generally accepted accounting principles or other comprehensive basis of accounting (including the cash receipts and disbursements basis and modifications of the cash basis).

2.	Evaluate and obtain a sufficient understanding of LBGI/B&V's internal controls related to the AIRP, assess control risk, and identify reportable conditions, including material internal control weaknesses.  

3.	Perform tests to determine whether LBGI/B&V complied, in all material respects, with contract/task order terms and applicable laws and regulations related with USAID-funded programs and projects.  All material instances of noncompliance and all indications of illegal acts must be identified.  

4.	Determine if LBGI/B&V has taken adequate corrective action on prior audit report recommendations.

5.	Determine if LBGI/B&V has delivered, accounted for, and made proper disposition of commodities and supplies purchased under the Contract or task order, or furnished by USAID under the Contract or task order.

6.	Determine if LBGI/B&V has delivered technical assistance according to the Contract or task order.  

LBGI/B&V is responsible for the design and implementation of programs and controls to prevent and detect fraud.  However, the Auditor must design audit steps and procedures in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and U.S. Government Auditing Standards to provide reasonable assurance of detecting situations or transactions in which irregularities or illegal acts have occurred or are likely to have occurred.  If such evidence exists, the Auditor must contact the USAID Regional Inspector General (RIG) in Manila and must exercise due professional care in pursuing indications of possible irregularities and illegal acts so as not to interfere with potential future investigations, legal proceedings, or both.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, during the term of this contract, the Contractor shall post a notice, in the form of a poster, informing employees of their rights concerning union membership and payment of union dues and fees, in conspicuous places in and about all its plants and

offices, including all places where notices to employees are customarily posted. The notice shall include the following information (except that the information pertaining to National Labor Relations Board shall not be included in notices posted in the plants or offices of carriers subject to the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 151-188)). 

Notice to Employees 
Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain their jobs. Under certain conditions, the law permits a union and an employer to enter into a union-security agreement requiring employees to pay uniform periodic dues and initiation fees. However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. 
If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment. If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments. 
For further information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either at one of its Regional offices or at the following address or toll free number: 
National Labor Relations Board

1-866-316-6572 (TTY) 
To locate the nearest NLRB office, see NLRB's website at http://www.nlrb.gov. 
(c) The Contractor shall comply with all provisions of Executive Order 13201 of February 17, 2001, and related implementing regulations at 29 CFR Part 470, and orders of the Secretary of Labor. 
(d) In the event that the Contractor does not comply with any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), or (g), the Secretary may direct that this contract be cancelled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part, and declare the Contractor ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures at 29 CFR Part 470, Subpart B?Compliance Evaluations, Complaint Investigations and Enforcement Procedures. Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided by 29 CFR Part 470, which implements Executive Order 13201, or as are otherwise provided by law. 
(e) The requirement to post the employee notice in paragraph (b) does not apply to? 
(1) Contractors and subcontractors that employ fewer than 15 persons; 
(2) Contractor establishments or construction work sites where no union has been formally recognized by the Contractor or certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of the Contractor?s employees;
 
(3) Contractor establishments or construction work sites located in a jurisdiction named in the definition of the United States in which the law of that jurisdiction forbids enforcement of union-security agreements; 
(4) Contractor facilities where upon the written request of the Contractor, the Department of Labor Deputy Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Programs has waived the posting requirements with respect to any of the Contractor?s facilities if the Deputy Assistant Secretary finds that the Contractor has demonstrated that? 
(i) The facility is in all respects separate and distinct from activities of the Contractor related to the performance of a contract; and 
(ii) Such a waiver will not interfere with or impede the effectuation of the Executive order; or 
(5) Work outside the United States that does not involve the recruitment or employment of workers within the United States. 
(f) The Department of Labor publishes the official employee notice in two variations; one for contractors covered by the Railway Labor Act and a second for all other contractors. The Contractor shall? 
(1) Obtain the required employee notice poster from the Division of Interpretations and Standards, Office of Labor-Management Standards, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N-5605, Washington, DC 20210, or from any field office of the Department?s Office of Labor-Management Standards or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs; 
(2) Download a copy of the poster from the Office of Labor-Management Standards website at http://www.olms.dol.gov; or 
(3) Reproduce and use exact duplicate copies of the Department of Labor?s official poster. 
    (g) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, entered into in connection with this contract, unless exempted by the Department of Labor Deputy Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Programs on account of special circumstances in the national interest under authority of 29 CFR 470.3(c). For indefinite quantity subcontracts, the Contractor shall include the substance of this clause if the value of orders in any calendar year of the subcontract is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Pursuant to 29 CFR Part 470, Subpart B?Compliance Evaluations, Complaint Investigations and Enforcement Procedures, the Secretary of Labor may direct the Contractor to take such action in the enforcement of these regulations, including the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance with respect to any such subcontract or purchase order. If the Contractor becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor or vendor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the Contractor may request the United States, through the Secretary of Labor, to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States. 

 It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN:  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract


number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

  Washington, D. C. 20593
   Telephone (202) 372-3692
 Fax:  (202) 475-3904

             Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be submitted via email no later than 28 February 2008 by 11:00 A.M, and be directed to: Jay McReynolds at e-mail jay.s.mcreynolds@uscg.mil, telephone (510) 637-5975, with a copy to Valerie Rivera-Chase, at e-mail:  valerie.s.riverachase@uscg.mil, or by telephone (510) 637-5972.

I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1(c),Justification to procure using other than full and open competition:

1.	Agency and Contracting Activity- Naval War College, Newport RI 02841
2.	 Nature/Description of action: Requirement is for the purchase of components of Cisco switch for building upgrade
3.	Description of Supplies/Services: Cisco switch and maintenance of switch
4.	Identification of Statutory Authority :     10 U. S. C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c)
5.	Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications: This equipment purchase is part of an ongoing implementation of proprietary VLAN protocol on the Cisco equipment.
6.	FedBizOps Announcement/Potential Sources: a combined synopsis/solicitation is  released herein 
7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price: Price Reasonableness will be determined based upon competition.
8.	Description of Market Research:  There are many authorized resellers of Cisco brand items.
9.	Supporting Facts: This brand of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity and common troubleshooting to minimize downtime.
10.	Listing of Interested Sources: Any authorized Cisco reseller is invited to submit pricing.
11.	Actions taken to remove barriers to competition: None. Market Research determined there are plenty of authorized Cisco resellers for the equipment.
12.	POP/Delivery: The Gov?t estimates it will be a 30 day delivery schedule after Contractor?s receipt of order.
13.	Justification: Cisco products are required to ensure consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use, and interoperability. The NWC site is 100% Cisco switches, routers and network equipment to provide component inter-operability. NWC is currently running a Cisco proprietary VLAN protocol on the Cisco equipment. Non-Cisco equipment will not inter-operate correctly with NWC?s current implementation of the VLAN protocol. Additionally, Cisco equipment meets DoD FIPS 140-2 certification requirements. All tools for management and managing equipment are specifically designed to support Cisco devices. Site personnel and system administrators are trained exclusively on Cisco equipment. Re-training of site personnel is cost prohibitive and is not justifiable. If NWC receives non-Cisco equipment, devices will not function or inter-operate properly with current Cisco equipment and have the potential to sit idle as they will not furnish the site with the equipment required to provide continued educational services to our military students.

Offers are due no later than 1:00 PM (Eastern Standard Time) on 28 March 2008. Reference the solicitation number when submitting your quote (N00124-08-Q-0210). Quotations must be submitted electronically to: sheila.valloney@nwc.navy.mil or faxed to ATTN: Sheila K. Valloney @ (401) 841-3567.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number is RFQ08G 00017 and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-23. The Environmental Protection agency (EPA) anticipates that a purchase order will be awarded as a firm-fixed price purchase order using far FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334516 and the size Standard is 500 employees.  This procurement is for the acquisition of a Maintenance Contract for Centralized De-ionized Water-Purification Systems at the Gulf Ecology Division (GED) for a period of five (5) years (base year and four (4) option years). The contractor shall provide all management, personnel, materials, and labor to perform the work set forth herein in accordance with all applicable industry performance standards, national, state, and local codes, and federal specifications.  The incoming potable water (drinking water) coming into GED needs to be further purified by means of ion-resin and charcoal bed filter units in order to prevent destruction of the in-house final water purifier units that ensure water at 18 milli-ohm conductance. These purification filters are often called mixed bed deionizer and operate in coupled pairs of Carbon Bed, and Mixed Bed Type I that form one unit of water purification. GED has separate locations where such filter clusters are located; inside the Nutrients Lab of building 45, inside the utility room in building 45, inside the utility room for buildings 47/49, inside the wet-lab of building 20, and inside the chemistry lab of building 20.  The contractor shall provide, install, maintain and service all tanks/filters:   Bldg 45, Nutrient Lab, one -1.2 Cu. Ft. Carbon Cylinder, two -  1.2 Cu. Ft. Mixed Bed Type 1 Deionizers, one -  9.75?

Service Schedule:  Deionizers: Semi-annually or when quality light goes off which ever occurs first.  Note:  Historically two additional visits have been made in addition to the semi annual visit due to the quality light going off.    Carbons:  Semi-annually, 5 Micron Pre-Filters at Deionizer exchange,0.2 Micron Post-Filters:  Semi-annually.  Maintenance shall be performed during normal business hours.  After each visit, the contractor shall deliver a report on each system within seven days to the technical representative.  The report shall provide each item replaced and the status of each system. Since these units are to prolong and protect the life of GED=s in-house final water purifiers (called 18 milli-ohm water) units, these units need the incoming water (soft water) to meet the following two minimum specification requirements; therefore the contractor shall provide Asoft water@ with the following specifications: The contractor shall provide and install and maintain the cylinders and filter listed in above in Task Description. The treated water shall have as a minimum 99 micro-semens conductivity/centimeter at 25 C.  The treated water shall maintain continuous municipal pressure and water flow.

As used in this clause--Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. (3) For long-term contracts?

The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/ . (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: The Contractor represents that it [ ] is, [ ] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 333924 assigned to contract number (Determined at Award).[Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].

Notice to Employees 
Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain their jobs. Under certain conditions, the law permits a union and an employer to enter into a union-security agreement requiring employees to pay uniform periodic dues and initiation fees. However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. 
If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment. If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments. 
For further information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either at one of its Regional offices or at the following address or toll free number:

For indefinite quantity subcontracts, the Contractor shall include the substance of this clause if the value of orders in any calendar year of the subcontract is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Pursuant to 29 CFR Part 470, Subpart B?Compliance Evaluations, Complaint Investigations and Enforcement Procedures, the Secretary of Labor may direct the Contractor to take such action in the enforcement of these regulations, including the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance with respect to any such subcontract or purchase order. If the Contractor becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor or vendor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the Contractor may request the United States, through the Secretary of Labor, to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States. 

 It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN:  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract


number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Commandant (CG-9131)
       1900 Half St S.W. JR11-0203
  Washington, D. C. 20593
   Telephone (202) 372-3692
 Fax:  (202) 475-3904

             Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be submitted via email no later than 28 February 2008 by 11:00 A.M, and be directed to: Jay McReynolds at e-mail jay.s.mcreynolds@uscg.mil, telephone (510) 637-5975, with a copy to Valerie Rivera-Chase, at e-mail:  valerie.s.riverachase@uscg.mil, or by telephone (510) 637-5972.

The vendor(s) shall provide each laboratory with a list of deficiencies to correct and allow written responses to these deficiencies before final disposition and accreditation.  The vendor(s) must provide reports to the laboratory, the Pathology Regional Commissioners and the P&LMS National Enforcement Office in headquarters. If interim annual self-inspections are required as a part of the accreditation process, the laboratory will retain the list of deficiencies and corrective action for review at the next onsite inspection, but results of these inspections/surveys will be tracked and published in the report for the P&LMS National Enforcement Office.  Inspectors/Surveyors must be knowledgeable in the areas being inspected. The vendor(s) will define standards for inspectors/surveyors. Vendor(s) must describe in detail their inspection process, including their requirements for inspections/surveys and training provided to the inspectors/surveyors.  Deficiencies will be specifically noted in writing and the laboratory must be informed of all deficiencies. Serious deficiencies will require follow up correction by the laboratory.

The P&LMS National Enforcement Office and relevant Regional Commissioner's Office will be kept appraised of such actions. The vendor(s) will provide the laboratory with a copy of the standards used for the inspection/survey.

No Offeror without deemed status shall be awarded a contract.  Price shall be evaluated for amount and reasonableness.  The Offeror must provide a rational basis for the price proposed using complexity points or other defined criteria for lab size and complexity used in its accreditation practice. This basis shall be used to establish CLINS which allow fixed prices for labs of differing sizes, tests and complexity levels.  Offerors may submit their discounted "commercial" price list with an explanation of how the pricing would apply to 3 lab types (minimal, moderate, and high complexity as defined in current accreditation standards).
