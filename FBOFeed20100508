<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&A)
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as the Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).  In accordance with FAR Part 11.105, Far 6.302-1(c), and VAAR 811.105 (items peculiar to one manufacturer), this memo serves as the justification for soliciting brand name hardware, maintenance, and support services.

1.	Agency and Contracting Activity:

Requesting Agency:  	Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO)
			 	Office of Information and Technology (OI&T)
			 	810 Vermont Ave. NW
			 	Washington, DC 20420 
				  
Contracting Activity:  	Center for Acquisition Innovation (CAI-Austin)
  	1701 Directors Blvd, Suite 600
  	Austin, TX 78744

2.	Nature and/or description of the action:

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to award a firm-fixed price (FFP) task order against the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract.  This requirement is for brand name specific hardware and maintenance products manufactured by Cisco Systems, Incorporated and services from Cisco or any authorized dealer or re-seller of Cisco Systems hardware and SMARTnet suite of technical maintenance support. The period of performance for maintenance services is one (1) year.   

3.   A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs              (including the estimated value):  

The proposed acquisition is for Cisco Systems, Inc. hardware (Cisco 6500 switch, 3900 router, and associated hardware) and Cisco Systems, Inc. SMARTnet technical maintenance services. The VACO campus network is being extended to a new site located at 2011 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202 in order support an additional 45 to 65 VA employees and conference rooms. The Cisco 6500 switch and 3900 router allows the 2011 Crystal Drive location fiber uplinks and allows Digital Signal 3 (DS3) connection to be installed in a timely fashion while facilitating the main task of designing, installing and monitoring major network computer room.  In addition, installation using the Cisco switch enables the Information Technology Support Division (ITSS) to maintain the network security posture and connectivity without disruption of services.

4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 

41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (c) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - Brand Name."

5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.   
VACO OI&T requires hardware and services that are compatible with other current network components, current trained staff, the current national Cisco SMARTnet maintenance contract, and current reporting capabilities. Cisco is the only brand name that meets the Government's total requirements. In addition, VACO OI&T have made substantial investments in the existing networking infrastructure which consists primarily of Cisco systems network equipment. Cisco brands are required to prevent technology problems caused by using multiple brands in a single brand network. 

Current network components: The current national VA routing protocol used to connect site devices to the VA Wide Area Network (WAN) is Cisco's proprietary protocol Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).   EIGRP uses an Autonomous System (AS) number and only routers using the same AS number can exchange routing information using that protocol. Therefore, to ensure continuity and compatibility, VA must use Cisco routers. 
In addition, Cisco based systems are deployed throughout VACO and maintaining network availability is a critical service.   

Current trained staff: As VA works to streamline support for network configurations and better leverage staff, there is an added advantage to managing the number of different configurations and variation in vendor equipment to a common set of equipment. Existing VA staff has experience troubleshooting the configuration and set up of Cisco routers and associated Cisco data network equipment, evaluating and assisting in the design of Cisco router networks and associated data network equipment, and performing problem resolution activities to maintain the integrity of the Cisco router data network.   Additionally, using other than the Cisco brand provides no demonstrable value as it will require additional training and resources to bring staff to present levels of operational proficiency.  This causes unacceptable delays in sustaining the Agency's critical mission network operations, and duplicates training and operational costs already expended in arriving at the current level of network operational stability.

Current national Cisco SMARTnet maintenance contract: The required SMARTnet technical maintenance support is the only option of servicing these proprietary systems. VA has a national VA Wide contract with Sword & Shield for the Cisco SMARTnet suite of technical maintenance support service that provides the VA owned Cisco equipment maintenance support after the initial 12 months warranty. Therefore, re-procurement of hardware other than Cisco, would duplicate the cost of yearly maintenance and increases the overall total ownership/lifecycle costs.

Continuing use of the Cisco brand will mitigate the risk of unacceptable disruption or failure and ensure the reliability of the Agency's mission critical network operations. 

6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  

Efforts will be made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  The proposed contract action is a task order placed under Subpart 16.5. All SEWP IV orders are placed under existing IDIQ contracts, and thus are not required to be synopsized pursuant to FAR 16.505(a)(1).  

The SEWP IV GWAC is composed of four SEWP groupings (A, B, C, and D) and each will be afforded the opportunity to provide an offer. Therefore, in accordance with (IAW) FAR 16.505 (b)(1), each contractor shall be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding $3,000 issued under multiple delivery-order contracts. 

The contract specialist shall utilize the SEWP IV RFQ and search tools, which automatically provide Fair Opportunity when selecting contract holders.  Additionally, IAW FAR 6.305, this Justification will be made available for public inspection and will be posted to http://www.fbo.gov within 14 days of contract award.

7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  

The anticipated proposed prices are based on previously negotiated prices under the current SEWP contract.  The products on the SEWP contract have been competed on their schedules and the price competition ensures that the pricing of delivery orders are considered fair and reasonable. The pricing on the SEWP IV contract were determined to be fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b).  

The VA will evaluate the quotes based upon Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). It is anticipated that two or more Offerors will be received, and therefore a fair and reasonable price determination will be made, in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, by evaluating competitive quotes that propose the lowest evaluated price meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. Price competition is also expected from authorized resellers. Technical acceptability will be determined by vendors who offer the brand name.

8.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  

Market research was performed to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulations and to ensure the Government receives the best value for this procurement.  This research indicated that the requirement is available via the SEWP IV Government-Wide Acquisition Contract.  Therefore, the requirement shall be solicited under SEWP IV pursuant to the memorandum issued by Robert T. Howard, Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology, on June 1, 2007.  The memorandum instructs VA offices to use the SEWP IVV contract for all IT acquisitions as of June 15, 2007.  These items are available on SEWP.  By utilizing the RFQ Tool available at http://www.sewp.nasa.gov  it has been shown that many vendors are able to compete for this requirement.

9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: 
None.

10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.   
 	None.

11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  

The Agency will continually assess the best technology solutions.  Future requirements will be evaluated to determine and provide for the Government's best interest.  

Procurement of unlimited data rights, training, or procuring knowledge within the Government to supply the required services. This alternative is not currently available since Cisco owns all rights to the software currently.

VA will continue to monitor the usefulness of Cisco Systems and the agency's satisfaction with the vendor's performance of support services. Should the current product and/or the maintenance and support services fail to meet the government's requirements, competition will be sought in future acquisitions of this product.

12.	Certification requirement:  (Technical/requirements personnel must certify).  

I certify the supporting data, including the statement of the Government's minimum needs and other rationale for other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge.  I certify that this information associated with my request to pursue a contract on a brand name is accurate and complete.

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Justification for a sole source purchase is provided as follows:</span></p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>USDA-ARS-MWA-NADC2. Nature/Description of Action(s):<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purchase of a unit capable of performing both real-time and conventional PCR is required for our lab to perform PCR analyses on milk, feces, tissues, and blood for the detection of a pathogen specific to our research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">2. Description of Supplies/Services</strong>: Applied Biosystems FAST Real-time PCR system. This system can perform quantitative real-time PCR as well as conventional PCR and post-PCR analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It can also be used as a fluorescent plate reader. The unit uses a tungsten-halogen lamp, a cooled charge coupled device (CCD) camera, and an optical pathway utilizing five excitation and five emission filters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The instrument has the</p>
<p>option to use an internal passive reference, such as ROXTM dye, to normalize collected data. Data collected using Fast mode enable runs to be completed in as little as 30 minutes compared to 90 minutes of other Real-time PCR systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It can run 96 samples at a time. <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">3. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications</strong>: Applied Biosystems is necessary for we already have the filters from our current machine that will fit on this machine saving hundreds of dollars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also this machine is what we currently use just an updated version so we are very familiar with its procedures and usage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If another machine is used we will have to do completely revalidate assays that have taken years to develop and optimize as the reagents for the AB system are dedicated to this machine. This could be time consuming and extra reagents may be needed costing more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, our collaborators on a major upcoming project utilize this system and it is essential that we be able to perform comparative analyses across labs. We also plan on maintaining our current AB Real-time PCR machine as long as possible as we have need for 2 units and we will need to be able to have standardized results using a similar platform and reagents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6. FedBizOpps (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Synopsis published 05/08/2010&nbsp; <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost</strong>: The Applied Biosystems FAST Real-time PCR is much like the AB Real-time system that we have now, except it will run assays in one third of the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the event that our current unit fails, we can use parts for the repair of the new system. Experiments currently in progress will require less time if using a machine very similar to the one we have now vs. using one that we don't have experience in and have to regenerate data and optimize assays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This would be a very time consuming and costly to ARS.&nbsp; <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">8. Description of Market Research</strong>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are very happy and had much success with the AB Real-time PCR unit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The unit just needs to be updated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's an older machine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Knowing our luck with the previous machine and have very good support from Applied Biosystems we would like to stay with a company that has been very helpful and easy to reach for assistance when needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Especially during a critical time within our experiment, if the machine goes down they will try and walk you through steps to get the machine up and running again if necessary. In addition, the popularity of this particular brand within the Center assures that we can continue our studies without interruption in the event of a catastrophic failure of the unit.&nbsp; 9. Listing of Interested Sources:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>N/A&nbsp; <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">10. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition</strong>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Current experiments that will be continuing for some time will need to be completed with very similar equipment so that no more discrepancies will occur than necessary.&nbsp; 11.
