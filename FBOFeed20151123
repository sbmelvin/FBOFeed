<DESC>Significant progress has previously been made under the Advanced Optical Coatings (AOC) and more recently the Advanced Development of Protection Technologies (ADePT) programs to advance the state of the art of optical coatings.  The majority of the recent advancements have focused on the visible through near and into the short wave infrared wavelength regions (VIS, NIR and SWIR respectively).  One filter example was the development of optical coating process control technology for rugate optical coatings. These unique, graded-index optical coatings had (at the time) never been demonstrated. Initial work was in the fabrication of &lsquo;digital' rugate filters where the effective graded-index profile was composed of a large number of discreet high and low index material layers. Ongoing work led to the development of fully-mixed analog rugate filters where the high and low index materials were blended to create the desired index profile. In this time period, advances in the general optical coating industry lead to three key, enabling technologies:
<p>1.	Advancement in optical coating design methodologies such as enhanced thin film (ETF) and needle optimized designs.<br />2.	Improvements in monitoring and control techniques allowing for the fabrication of rugate and dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) filter types.<br />3.	Advancements in deposition processes allowing stable sputtering (constant rate) and reliable (constant refractive index) thin film layers.</p>
<p>Based on these advances, the cost effective fabrication of a wide range of high performance optical filters (e.g., notch, bandpass, dichroic, short pass, long pass) has been enabled at SWIR and shorter wavelengths.  Similarly, to advance the state of the art in optical coatings for the medium wavelength infrared and/or long wavelength infrared (MWIR and LWIR respectively) regions, a broad-based perspective is required encompassing advanced coating designs, improvements in monitor and control techniques, and advancements in deposition processes.</p>

Mandatory Language: In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participations has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractor but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award may be based on a combination of price, technical capability, and past performances detailed in the solicitation. Qualifications Requirements do not exist and the government does not own the data rights. Written procedure will be used for this solicitation. No telephone requests. Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestors are acceptable.

<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the provision of standard software maintenance of ArcGIS licenses used for NATO Core GIS (Geographic Information Systems).
<p>NCI Agency is responsible for the in-service support of major NATO Communications and Information Systems, some of which are under the management and monitoring of the Joint Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) Service Line (SL), which is located at The Hague (Netherlands). The JISR SL is responsible for the management, monitoring, and maintenance of the NATO core GIS.</p>
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 2) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-NCIA-JISR-15-07 and all correspondence concerning the IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>It is planned to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the firm must&nbsp;be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): 03 December 2015<br /><br />- IFB issued (target): 11 December 2015</p>
<p>- Bid closing (target) : 29 January 2016</p>
<p>- Contract Award (target): mid-February 2016</p>

<CONTACT>William Sanfilippo, 703-428-4601

<a href="mailto:william.sanfilippo.mil@mail.mil">HQ USAINSCOM, Directorate of Contracting</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this presolicitation notice is to alert qualified vendors of pending Request for Proposal (RFP) release in meeting the Department of Defense (DoD) global requirement for a variety of language related services.  The anticipated contract award date is 23 August 2016. The DLITE II requirement specifically supports achieving Goal 2b of the Defense Language Transformation Roadmap (Jan 2005), and supports the DoD's National Military Strategy (NMS) and the President's National Security Strategy (NSS). The anticipated period of performance will be a five year base plus a five year option for a potential total of ten years. The contract(s) will be performance-based and competition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541930.   <br> The DoD's high level objective for the contract foreign language support services requirement is to get the right skill set, to the right location, at the right time, and at a fair and reasonable cost. To accomplish this objective it is envisioned that the contract(s) shall provide language-related services including interpreting, translating, and transcription services to support combatant commander and Intelligence Community (IC) missions within their geographical areas of responsibility (AOR).  To ensure that high levels of quality, performance, and cost controls are maintained, it is envisioned that contractor(s) will provide the necessary management, supervisory, and administrative personnel to direct, administer, and report on these services on a daily basis. Particular attention should be given to the costs associated with subcontracts.  It is expected that much of the performance under these contracts shall include nonspecific, but short notice and urgent, requirements from various locations throughout the globe, as well as, mature (clearly defined) requirements for areas such as: Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Guantanamo Bay, and various CONUS locations. Performance, deliverables, and exact location(s) of the work will be conveyed to the Contractor(s) by the Contracting Officer or his/her designated Contracting Officer Representative(s) (COR). The contract(s) will require personnel who can perform monitoring, transcribing, translating, and interpreting (listening, writing, speaking, and reading) from the targeted language to English and vice versa, and occasionally, from one targeted language to another targeted language. Contract linguists hired under these contracts may at some time be required to perform any of these duties.  However, it is understood that no single individual can perform all tasks with equal competence.  Normally, individuals will be assigned to those tasks for which they can demonstrate the strongest aptitude and possess the greatest experience.  Language proficiency testing is required in the source language(s) and English for all levels of linguists in the four basic communications skills: listening, reading, writing, and speaking. Evidence of language proficiency testing with acceptable results is required prior to assignment. Additionally, some number of contractor personnel will require either a Top Secret or a Secret clearance. It is also desirable for contractors to manage linguists to a secondary level of mission related skills, such as: Medical, Legal, Engineering, and Military fields in order to ensure that the right skill quote mark set quote mark is applied to each mission. Linguists will be deployed to targeted area(s) with adequate contractor management staff and will be required to undergo the necessary screening, vetting, clearing, and approval processes prior to, during, and following deployment to the host nation.  <br> This notice neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict INSCOM to an ultimate acquisition approach.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement, and requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.  Any information submitted by respondents to this notice is strictly voluntary.  <br> Contracting Office Address:  <br> HQ USAINSCOM, Directorate of Contracting, ATTN: IAPC-DOC, 8825 Beulah Street, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5246  <br> Place of Performance:  <br> HQ USAINSCOM, Directorate of Contracting ATTN: IAPC-DOC, 8825 Beulah Street Fort Belvoir VA 22060-5246  <br> Point of Contact(s):  <br> usarmy.belvoir.inscom.mbx.hq-linguist-09@mail.mil  <br> Contracting Office Address:  <br> HQ USAINSCOM, Directorate of Contracting, ATTN: IAPC-DOC, 8825 Beulah Street, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5246  <br> Place of Performance:  <br> HQ USAINSCOM, Directorate of Contracting ATTN: IAPC-DOC, 8825 Beulah Street Fort Belvoir VA <br> 22060-5246 <br> Point of Contact(s):  <br> William Sanfilippo, 703-428-4601 <br> Or  <br> Michelle Miller, 703-428-4568 <br>

<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION<br />The Air Force Institute of Technology requires onsite support for academic Research, Development and Demonstration (RDD) and Operational Training &amp; Testing (OTT) events at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center (MUTC) using components of AFIT's GRANITE System.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS<br />The Contractor shall provide onsite support for academic Research, Development, and Demonstration (RDD) and Operational Training &amp; Testing (OTT) events at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center (MUTC) using components of AFIT's GRANITE System. This includes support for RF Intelligence (RFINT) activity being conducted by AFIT personnel (faculty, staff, and student researchers) and supported by external customers. AFIT's RFINT program embodies traditional "INTs" and has most recently focused on commercial communication, Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA), and Global Positioning System (GPS) applications.<br />AFIT's GRANITE System is a federated wireless communication system (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, mesh, cellular) consisting of more than 400 individual equipment items. The contractor shall be granted access to GRANITE System components at Muscatatuck Urban Training Center in Butlerville, Indiana (MUTC) per an AFIT-AMCCO MOA (#AFITMOA127). The contractor shall ensure that support personnel are within 100 miles of MUTC and can respond onsite within 2.0 hours.</p>
<p><br />Work shall comply with government and local laws and regulations. This is a non-personal service. Contractor personnel are not subject to the supervision and control of a Government officer or employee.</p>
<p>The contractor shall: <br />1) Complete inventory and field status updates at least annually, with additional inventories and updated on an as needed basis at the request of AFIT/ENG. This will be conducted as a hands-on account of all serial-numbered GRANITE System components and update the equipment inventory list. The list shall include component manufacturer, serial number, hardware description (transmitter, receiver, transceiver, server, and antenna) functional description (cellular, point-to-point) and MUTC location (building, room number, GPS coordinates). In locations where equipment is not easily accessible for hands-on accounting (water and radio tower installations), eyes-on identification may be permissible using optical magnification devices. In locations where equipment is not easily accessible for hands-on accounting, eyes-on identification may be permissible using optical magnification devices. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, instrumentation, and supplied necessary to perform the required inventory.<br />2) Conduct on an as needed basis to complete periodic preventative maintenance, troubleshoot inoperable components, and maintain system operational performance. This includes required replacement or upgrades of hardware, firmware, and/or operating software to sustain reliable system operating performance and regain system operating performance in the event of catastrophic failure or performance degradation.<br />3) For selected events, customers may desire to functionally control and operate selected GRANITE System components during their events. Such control will generally be limited to selected GRANITE System components supporting the customer's event and require prior vetting and certification of customer operators on the selected components. When required for selected events, the contractor shall conduct onsite vetting and certification of customer operators. <br />4) Support site surveys aimed at identifying GRANITE system components, capabilities and resources required to support envisioned RDD/PTT events and MUTC system integration activity. Based on event goals/objectives and MUTC system integration requirements, the contractor shall develop and deliver an event and/or integration plan that identifies required resources to complete the event or integration activity.<br />5) Reconfigure the GRANITE System (hardware and/or software) to provide the required operational capability to support event goals/objectives within the MUTC infrastructure. Reconfiguration will be based on an approved event and/or integration plan provided by AFIT and operational functionality of the reconfigured system shall be verified. <br />6) Operate the appropriately configured GRANITE System components in accordance with an approved event and/or integration plan. In cases where a vetted customer operator is involved in an event, the contractor shall oversee customer operator actions for system components under customer control to ensure system operation remains within approved plan bounds, and operate remaining GRANITE System components in accordance with the approved plan. <br />7) Compile and analyze selected system level data and generate system operating summary reports in accordance with an approved event and/or integration plan or at the request of AFIT/ENG to support government reporting and/or research documentation requirements. Relevant data may include system configurations files and parameter files for GRANITE components, or MUTC systems supported by GRANITE components, as well as data collected from other peripheral systems supporting the event.</p>

<p>ATTENTION small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort:</p>
<p>No set aside decision has been made; however, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the entire scope of AFIT's effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Nov 2011) ... (c) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern... ". Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.</p>
<p>If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>ATTENTION all potential respondents:<br />The acquisition strategy for this program has not been finalized. If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement. Please provide feedback on the requirement and what areas are likely candidates for SB subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part II. Capability Survey Questions<br />1. Describe briefly the capabilities of you or your organization and the nature of the services you provide. Include a description of your background and/or your staff composition to include those who would perform the outlined work listed in the Requirements Section. Please mention any required certifications.</p>
<p>2. Describe your company's past experience on previous projects similar in complexity to this requirement. Include contract numbers, a brief description of the work performed, period of performance, agency/organization supported, and individual point of contact (Contracting Officer or Program Manager).</p>
<p>3. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that we provide that would currently preclude your product/service from being a viable solution to our requirement?</p>
<p>4. Are there established market prices for our requirement? If you offer this product and/or service to both U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public? Is our requirement offered to both under similar terms and conditions? Briefly describe any differences.</p>
<p>If your company is interested, e-mail your responses to jillian.kovacs@us.af.mil. E-mail responses should be received no later than 7 December 2015. Direct and succinct responses are preferred. Marketing materials are considered an insufficient response. <br />All responses must be UNCLASSIFIED; no classified material will be accepted or considered with this Sources Sought Synopsis. The response to Part I. Business Information should be single spaced, 12pt font. The response to Part II. Capabilities should be limited to no more than 20 pages (8.5x11 inches), single spaced, 12pt font. In addition, identify a representative to support further Government inquiries and requests for clarification of the information provided, if needed. Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly. The Air Force will handle proprietary items in accordance with FAR 2.101 and 3.104.</p>
<p>Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and posted on this FedBizOps website, unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a company or that company's response. Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after the sources sought assessments are completed. An Industry Day (date to be determined) with one-on-one information sessions with respondents may be offered to clarify the Government's understanding of their submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss their business approach.</p>

<SUBJECT>15 - - Sources sought for Modification of Phase III Low Rate Initial Production Phase Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command Development (IBCS) Contract Options
<SOLNBR>W31P4Q-16-R-0059
<RESPDATE>120415
<CONTACT>Scott Wilhite, Contract Specialist, Phone 2563134223, Email scott.a.wilhite3.civ@mail.mil - Scott Wilhite, Contract Specialist, Phone 2563134223, Email scott.a.wilhite3.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) announcement is to identify any interested sources before soliciting non-competitive acquisition per FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source" for a modification to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) development effort. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this announcement.
<p>The requirement of this acquisition is for a modification to the IBCS Development contract, W31P4Q-08-C-0418 to restructure the Phase III Low Rate Initial Preproduction (LRIP) options to align with the 8 October 2014 Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) directed IAMD Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) changes. The OSD directed IAMD APB changes result in a 14 month slip to the IAMD Program Milestone (MS) C and associated IAMD integration, test, and evaluation activities; incorporation of a second LRIP production buy, and incorporation of additional IAMD weapon/sensor component interface requirements.</p>
<p>The IBCS LRIP major supplies and services to be acquired include: modification of IBCS Major End Item (MEI) production, Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), and New Equipment Training CLINs to reflect updates to the IAMD Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) and add requirements for two LRIP lots to field up to four Air and Missile Defense Battalion units with the most current configuration of IBCS MEIs; extending the Period of Performance (PoP) of engineering, integration, and testing for IBCS MEI hardware obsolescence issues, IBCS software root cause and corrective actions, and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) updates; and, add pre-planned product improvement services to develop, integrate, test new IAMD weapons, and sensor component interfaces into IBCS.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional acquisition programs that focus primarily on the development of a single system or platform, the IAMD Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching System of Systems (SoS) capability with all participating Army Air Defense components functioning interdependently to provide total-operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The Army IAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the Army IAMD architecture and developing the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) that provides Engagement Operations Centers (EOCs) implementing common Mission Command (MC) capability, an Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) capability for fire-control connectivity enabling distributed operations, and the common Plug and Fight (P&amp;F) B-Kits located on the EOCs and the IFCN Relays that network enable existing sensor components and weapon components with the IBCS.</p>
<p>The Government does not currently have available a current technical data package for this effort.</p>
<p>Foreign participation will be allowed only at the subcontract level by waiver.</p>
<p>The responses shall address:<br />&bull; Army Air Defense Expertise - Skills, knowledge and abilities associated development, manufacture, integration, and fielding of Army Air Defense Systems to include but not limited to Patriot, Sentinel, IFPC, C2BMC, THAAD, and ADAM.<br />&bull; Conceptual approach, estimated lead times, key Government Furnished Property, driving assumptions and risks associated with the assumption and control of the IBCS Product Baseline, production facilitatization, and refurbishment/production of IBCS MEIs that support the start of LRIP DT in JAN 2017 and First Unit Equipped in June 2017 assuming an October 2016 award date. <br />&bull; Conceptual approach, estimated lead times, and risks associated with how the contractor would assume the IBCS software to be responsive to DT/OT activities conducted in FY17.</p>
<p>All responses shall be submitted to the U.S. Army Contracting command, ATTN: CCAM-SM-T/Scott Wilhite, Building 5250, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5280 or email: scott.a.wilhite3.civ@mail.mil. Your written responses are required by 1500 CDT 04 December 2015. All questions and comments must be in writing (electronic email responses are acceptable), and no telephone calls will be accepted. The submission of this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items, nor does the U.S. Army intend to award on the basis of this request for sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: <br />This is a request for information (RFI) only. This is not an Invitation for Bids (IFB), Request for Quotations (RFQ), or Request for Proposals (RFP). The US Government is seeking sources to manufacture Inert Warheads for the Reduced Range Practice Rocket (RRPR) M28A2 on an interim basis pending the resolution of a protest of a recent competitive award for those warheads.
<p>Background:<br />The US Army Field Artillery community has identified a training need for the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) practice rockets. The Reduced Range Practice Rocket (RRPR) M28A2 is a cost-effective solution to that need. An inert warhead is mated to the same rocket motor assembly used on the M26 Tactical Rocket to provide MLRS batteries an opportunity to train with a rocket pod that has the same properties as the tactical pod and to experience the same effects of firing a tactical rocket, but at reduced ranges.</p>
<p>A quantity (Part # 13540611) of 1,041 will be procured at a rate of 380 per month over a three month ordering period. The Government will provide a Technical Data Package upon request.</p>
<p>Interested firms who believe they are capable of providing the above mentioned items are invited to indicate their interest by providing:</p>
<p>a) Company name, company address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), Cage Code, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number;<br />b) Business size (i.e. large, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, woman owned, etc...)<br />c) Affirmation of cleared personnel<br />d) Information regarding previous experience, if any, with the production of inert warheads.</p>
<p>All responses shall be unclassified.</p>
<p>All assumptions, including any assumed Government support, shall be clearly identified. All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked.</p>
<p>The closing date for this RFI is 3 December 2015.</p>
<p>The Government will not reimburse contractors or responders to this notice for any costs incurred in responding, or any subsequent exchange of information. All responses shall be transmitted electronically to Robert.m.jones7@us.army.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Government seeks to identify sources capable of designing and/or producing a Heavy Equipment Tractor and Trailer that will be able to haul the M1A2 Variants and M88A2 vehicles while meeting CONUS/OCONUS Transportability Requirements. Two goals are looking to be met at this time. The first, which is the short term goal, is obtaining a Heavy Equipment Tractor and Trailer that can transport the current M1A2SEPv2 (up to 77 Ton) while meeting CONUS/OCONUS axle weights for peace time administrative moves. The current HETS system (M1070A0/A1 Tractors with M1000 Trailer) does not meet CONUS/OCONUS Transportability Requirements and is not able to haul loads over 70 Tons in the current configuration. The second (long term) goal is obtaining a Heavy Equipment Tractor and Trailer that will be able to haul the M1A2SEPv3 Abrams Battle Tank, which will be ~82 Tons and fielded in FY2020. Based on this goal, the Government is looking into Tractor and Trailer solutions for hauling an 82 Ton threshold, 87 Ton objective payload while still meeting CONUS/OCONUS Transportability Requirements. <br /><br />The current Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET) M1070A1 Tractor front axle exceeds CONUS weight limit of 20,000 lbs. regardless of armor or payload. The HET M1070A1 Tractor front axle exceeds Europe weight limit of 12,000 kg (26,455 lbs.) when the cab is armored with a Force protection package of ~6 Ton. The HET M1070A0 Tractor front axle exceeds CONUS weight limits, but not Europe weight limit. The HET M1000 Trailer pay-loaded with M1A2SEPv2 or M88 exceeds CONUS and Europe axle weight limits. The HET M1070A0 and M1070A1 Tractors' rear tridem exceeds CONUS tridem weight limits when pay-loaded. Europe measures the axles individually at a 12,000 kg limit, which is not met. The current HET exceeds European Bridge Military Load Classification (MLC) limits. Currently, Special road permits are being denied due to axle weights for HETS movement in California (M1070A1 &amp; M1000) &amp; Germany (M1000). States CONUS have varying axle weight limits. US and European load limits also vary. Current HETS exceeds length, width, and total payload limits for unrestricted highway transportation.
<p>Market Survey Request: The Government seeks to determine industry capacity to provide a Heavy Equipment Tractor and Trailer capability to meet the transportability and payload needs for CONUS and OCONUS as detailed in paragraph 1 for both the short term and long term goals. The questions are expanded upon in the Market Survey Questionnaire. Please provide any information describing your company's capabilities, quality, cost, other relevant information not specifically requested. This market research process is intended to obtain only non-proprietary available information about your company's capabilities. The associated Purchase Descriptions (ATPD's) are attached to this survey for the existing M1070 Tractor and M1000 Trailer. Ideally, the Government hopes your solution would meet both of these purchase descriptions, but at the increased weights for the short and long term solutions. The United States Government (USG) does NOT wish to obtain any proprietary or otherwise protected documents as a result of this market survey. The USG may return data or documents that have proprietary or protected markings. <br />All portions of this market survey are for market research purposes, subject to change at any time, are in no way binding on the USG, and do not represent an established requirement. This market survey is furnished for information purposes only with the understanding that the USG is under no obligation of any kind to proceed with an acquisition in any way related to or based upon the information set forth herein. Nothing contained in this survey should be regarded as a basis upon which to seek payment, reimbursement or other consideration from the USG. Moreover, this market survey is not intended as a solicitation of offers or request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>Equipment Technical Review Days: Please be aware that there will be an opportunity for vendors and OEMs responding to the Market Survey, to view the equipment at TARDEC, Detroit Arsenal Warren, MI Building 219, on 20 and 21 January 2016. This will give vendors time to inspect and measure physical HETS systems and ask any specific questions. Equipment planned to be on display will be an M1070A0/A1 Tractor, M1000 Trailer, and Abrams M1A2SEPv2 Battle Tank. Further details and/or specifics will be provided such as a website to sign up for attending equipment technical review days at a later date.</p>
<p>Response Format: Electronic responses are required respectively for parts 1 and 2 of the Questionnaire. It is requested that electronic responses be provided in any of the following formats: Microsoft Word 2010 or earlier, Microsoft Excel 2010 or earlier, Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 or earlier or Adobe Acrobat. The maximum size of each e-mail message should be no more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes. You may use multiple e-mail messages. The subject line must include the message number, (example: 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3), and quote mark "[Company's Name] response to Heavy Equipment Tractor and Trailer Market Survey". All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to respond to this market survey in order to be eligible for future contract awards.</p>
<p>Responses Due: It is anticipated that the Fed BIZ Ops announcement window will open on or about 1 December 2015. Responses shall be furnished to the government by NLT 1300 EST on 30 January 2016. Please submit electronic responses to this survey, as well as questions for clarification to:</p>
<p>Michael.h.rogers20.civ@mail.mil</p>
<p>MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE AND CURRENT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:</p>
<p>The questionnaire and relevant information for design considerations below are intended to provide a snapshot of the situation so that you can provide your company's capabilities for delivering a solution for a new Tractor and Trailer for the Short and/or Long Term Soltution. The questionnaire will be broken into two separate sections. Responses can be made submitted for the Tractor only, Trailer only, or both the Tractor and Trailer together, depending on your company's expertise.</p>
<p>TRACTOR AND TRAILER RELEVANT INFORMATION AND DESIGN SUGGESTIONS:</p>
<p>Please refer to attached Heavy Equipment Tractor and Trailer Purchase Descriptions (ATPD's) for the current M1070 and M1000 to obtain specific and important information that your solutions for the short and long term are recommended to have incorporated. Please read the ATPDs to help push your designed solutions to meet current requirements. Disregard actual capacity weights in the documents and assume they substitute the short and long term capacities of 77 Ton and 82 Ton (T), 87 Ton (O) instead of 140,000 lb (70 Ton) capacity.

The scope of the proposed project includes construction of P662 Triton Mission Control Facility at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, FL.

A decision will be made whether to issue the solicitation as a competitive set-aside for 8(a), HubZone, or SDVOSB contractors: first priority; issue a solicitation as a small business set-aside: second priority; or whether to issue an unrestricted solicitation with full and open competition: third priority.

The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements to submit Capability Statements consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references.
  Respondents must include references and a capability statement for a minimum of two (2) to a maximum of five (5) projects that meet the specific capabilities listed below:

Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities statement.  Submission of Capabilities statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Government in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.  After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among 8(a), HubZone, SDVOSB, or small business firms or to proceed with issuing an unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition.
  Please respond to this announcement no later than 14 December 2015, 1:00 pm EDT via email to dianne.haymans@navy.mil.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:

This is a Request for Information (RFI) to identify services that more efficiently integrate and better serve Veterans who receive community provided care.  VA is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  All responses shall be solely in the form of information and materials. In addition, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will host an Industry Day event with one on one sessions for Care in the Community.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS EVENT. This announcement serves as a notice and invitation to participate in this event, and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. 

The purpose of Industry Day is for VA to: (i) provide general information on a potential solicitation, (ii) share an overview of its current state of community care delivery, operations and requirements, (iii) outline its plans to expand and refine the use of community healthcare and operational resources in the future state, and (iii) solicit industry feedback. The city and date are listed below, the exact location will be provided through RSVP.  Attendance is voluntary and not required for proposing to future potential solicitations.
OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE:
On October 30, 2015, VA submitted a report to Congress, titled "Plan to Consolidate Programs of Department of Veterans Affairs to Improve Access to Care."  In the report, VA outlines its plans for transforming the way healthcare is delivered to America's Veterans.  The purpose of Industry Day is to explore how partnering and contracting with healthcare industry vendors can help VA achieve its transformation goals.  

One such goal is to establish and maintain a high performing integrated network of VA and external community providers that provides coordinated care.  VA will identify vendors that have the capability to establish and maintain the external community provider component of the integrated network in accordance with VA access standards.  

VA's transformation plan also recognizes that healthcare is an integrated and interoperable system of systems that support the delivery of care.  Therefore, VA is exploring the availability of vendors to perform additional core functions (beyond providing an external community provider network) in collaboration with the VA and in a manner that enhances delivery of care, operations, and provider and Veteran satisfaction.  These core functions include, but are not limited to:

"	Care Coordination 
"	Scheduling
"	Utilization Management
"	Population Management
"	Claims Processing
"	Customer and Health Information Services
"	Communications
"	Data Analysis 
"	Exchange of Healthcare Information 

Interested vendors are encouraged to review the "Plan to Consolidate Programs of Department of Veterans Affairs to Improve Access to Care" report for additional information and in advance of Industry Day.
INDUSTRY DAY LOCATION, TIME AND DATE
Industry day will be held December 8th and 9th, location TBD




The tentative schedule for the event is as follows:

Day	Time (all times local)	Topic
12-8-15	9:30 AM - 11:30 AM 	General Session - All Attendees

<DESC>The Department of the Interior (DOI), Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR), in cooperation with the Interior Business Center located in Denver, Colorado, will conduct industry outreach on December 22, 2015, from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. (Mountain Time) at Building 85, Denver Federal Center, Denver, Colorado 80225.  For those unable to attend in-person, the telephone conference number is 1-866-95-4280 and the participant code is 9563305.<br /><br />
<p>The purpose of this industry outreach is to conduct market research at a programmatic level to enable the federal government to establish an acquisition plan to determine the feasibility of expanding ONRR's Geographic Information System (GIS).</p>
<p>ONRR currently performs analyses and delivers GIS products on an as-needed basis. A team of GIS analysts review requests, perform analyses, and create products in response to the request. ONRR does not have a user interface that allows individual users to view the data, perform analysis, or create cartographic products or reports. ONRR uses the Department of Interior (DOI) standard GIS software provided by ESRI. Internal GIS developers use ESRI products to create, update, and maintain data and products with data stored primarily in the file geodatabase format. Several file geodatabases are comprised of a variety of data assembled from several sources internal and external in ESRI formats or derived from ESRI formats.</p>
<p>ONRR is transforming its framework for geospatial information and migrating from exclusively reacting to discrete product requirement-submissions to using methodologies that deliver content through user interaction with a web-based service.  ONRR is pursuing applications, services, and technological ideas to expand its Geographic Information Systems GIS services to the ONRR community.  ONRR seeks to make geospatial data, tools, technology, and services more accessible, discoverable, sharable, reusable, and reliable to the ONRR community which includes State, local, and tribal governments.</p>
<p>The goal of this outreach session is to request information from industry regarding ONRR's current strategy plan. We are reaching out in hopes to glean crucial input as well as networking and exchanging information between ONRR and industry.  Following the industry outreach session, this information may be used as guidance for an upcoming request for proposal. The Government plans on discussing with industry the following:</p>
<p>1.	Multiple users:  ONRR has approximately 600 users.  Of those users about 10 percent will be accessing the system simultaneously. The ability to scale to external users.<br />2.	Multiple physical locations:  Users will access the system from several geographic locations with users in both ONRR facilities and non-ONRR facilities.<br />3.	Web-based system.<br />4.	User role-based access:  ONRR user's ability to access the GIS based on roles to create, view, and analyzes data, and produce products such as maps, charts, and graphs.<br />5.	Centralized data:  Centralizing all data in a relational database management system such as Oracle or SQL Server.<br />6.	Multiple data sources:  Incorporating data acquired from several organizations including Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), United States Geological Survey (USGS), and private industry.<br />7.	Data integration:  Integrated data stored in multiple formats including ESRI, Oracle, SQL Server, MS Access, and MS Excel.<br />8.	Internal developers:  ONRR GIS developers' management of data and objects, perform analyses, produce products, and build web applications, queries and scripts. <br />9.	Metadata:  Metadata meeting Federal standards and are accessible and searchable.<br />10.	System security:   System security meeting Federal standards and utilizes the organizations established roles.<br />11.	Man hours required to create and establish this system.</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541512, which has a corresponding Size Standard of $27.5.  The Government is interested in all businesses to include, Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses 8(a) s, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, HubZone Businesses, and Women-Owned Small Businesses. Small Businesses are encouraged to participate in this industry outreach since information provided in this session will be beneficial for the anticipated future procurement action.</p>
<p><strong>For Government planning purposes, organizations that anticipate participating in the industry outreach session shall respond to this announcement no later than December 18, 2015.  Please confirm your interest to attend the industry outreach session by submitting, in writing via email, your name and contact information with phone number(s), fax numbers, email address, and an estimated number of attendees from your organization to: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Brenda McGehee at Brenda_J_McGehee@ibc.doi.gov</strong></p>

<DESC>The Office of Acquisition and Agreement Management (OAAM), of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of the NIST Laboratories, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Airbus of Germany under the authority of 41 USC 3304 (a)(1), for an ad-hoc service agreement for six existing Airbus Neutron Velocity Selectors. The service agreement is required for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods. The Government anticipates awarding a Blanket Purchase Agreement comprising of a base and option year line items.
<p>The NIST Center for Neutron Research provides a number of unique neutron scattering instruments in an accessible user facility. To maintain reliable operation of these instruments, repair and maintenance activities are required. This procurement is to provide for routine inspection and maintenance for six of the existing neutron velocity selectors that is critical to the operation of a number of our instruments.</p>
<p>Airbus DS GmbH (formerly Astrium GmbH or Dornier Satellite systems) has supplied NIST with all six of the high resolution Neutron Velocity Selectors (NVS) in operation at the Cold Neutron Research Facility. These NVSs operate under vacuum at very high speeds, up to a maximum of 16,000 rpm (about 270 revolutions per second) in the case of NVS-022 and even to maximum of 28,000 rpm (about 470 revolutions per second), in the case of NVS-014. At these speeds both the bearing and the balancing become very critical.</p>
<p>Airbus DS is the only vendor that has the knowledge and equipment to repair the NVS and this knowledge is proprietary and part of the mechanical design and specifications for these NVS's.</p>
<p>The existing control system and performance telemetry are specific to these NVS's and are the property of Airbus DS, therefore, compatibility is necessary to ensure proper operation. <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 811219, with a size standard of 20.9 million.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by December 7, 2015 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation and a notice of intent to sole source for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.5. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to procure for the Center for Information Technology (CIT) for the use of Microsoft Premier Support and Microsoft Consulting Services for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541519 and the business size standard is $25.5 million. This is not a 100% small business set-aside.<br />The Contractor shall provide Microsoft Premier Support and Microsoft Consulting Services.<br /><br />TASKS<br />The overall objective of this requirement is to obtain Microsoft Public Sector Services, including MCS and Premier support for HHS Operating Divisions (OpDiv), and Institutes and Centers (ICs). This contract will provide an integrated and comprehensive method for acquiring responsive, efficient, and cost-effective information technology consulting services and product support, incorporating technical and security requirements and considerations, for the maintenance and expansion of the HHS IT environment. <br /><br />The Contractor shall provide consulting services for the planning, design, standardization, and deployment of Microsoft products and services. In addition the Contractor shall evaluate, document, and recommend new advances in technology. The Contractor shall provide product support and trouble-shooting support to assist HHS with correctly configuring and operating Microsoft products in the HHS IT environment.<br /><br />SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION<br />Microsoft Premier Support (MPS) and Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS) provide technical support and assistance for NIH and HHS' current system configuration and current state operational activity. Microsoft's products are an integral part of the Department's day-to-day operating activities and their continued optimal functionality is of the utmost importance.<br />As the need arises for significant redesign of the current system configuration and/or operational capacity, Microsoft Consulting Services are used to provide technical system engineering design assistance. As the system engineering design is done largely at the Microsoft proprietary Operating System (OS) level, no other vendor has the proprietary rights, and thus the technical capacity which can be supported by any Microsoft certified consultant. The Government's use of Microsoft's Premier Consulting services is essential to its information technology structure, and the loss this support could essentially cause a break in service for the Government's computer infrastructure. <br />MPS services are necessary to meet the Government's continued requirements. Access to proprietary Microsoft Intellectual Property (IP) which include Operating System software code is required for all of the required MPS services, and this access is only available to Microsoft employees. Microsoft employees are required for access to proprietary Microsoft source code, tools, processes and knowledge to provide the MPS.<br />Microsoft is the only responsible source of the services provided, as they are the original software publisher for the Microsoft software products currently utilized within the NIH and HHS. NIH currently has an ongoing need to have sufficient root OS access privileges needed to conduct error condition troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and system restoral. <br />Replacing the Microsoft software with alternative software would generate an unnecessary cost to the taxpayer in the tens of millions of dollars range to replace both the Microsoft software itself and to re-engineer business that is designed to operate in the Microsoft operating system environment. This rough estimate is based on the number of desktops, laptops, and servers within the entire HHS that currently utilize various types of Microsoft products. Purchasing alternative software would cause a lapse in service, while acquiring, testing and implementing the new software, as well as degrade HHS's ability to meet its mission of providing services to its customers throughout the United States and abroad. Given the current climate and users' familiarity with Microsoft's products, this is a long term strategy that is impractical and would require more user buy in than necessary given the viable alternative.<br />HHS program staff have specified the Government's minimum needs for Microsoft Premier and Consulting services. The staff has certified that those technical specifications are complete and accurate and form the basis by which an award under FAR 6.302-1 is justified.<br /><br />This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is a RFQ available; however, all responsive sources may submit a capability statement in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the referenced service as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received electronically at the Government infrastructure by 1:00 PM EST on, December 2, 2015. Capability Statements must include pricing information and should reference NIHLM-2016721-DNB and should be submitted to dionne.brown@nih.gov. <br /><br />FEDERAL ACQUISITION REQULATION (FAR) CLAUSES<br />The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference.

L. 113-235), Government <br />agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) <br />under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or <br />subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal <br />confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such <br />employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a <br />designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or <br />agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene <br />requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by <br />a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. <br />(c) Representation.

<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-<br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);<br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (JUL 2013)<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-<br />"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings).

Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes- <br />(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted</p>

L. 113-235), Government <br />agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) <br />under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or <br />subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal <br />confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such <br />employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a <br />designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or <br />agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene <br />requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by <br />a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. <br />(c) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not <br />require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or <br />abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise <br />restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, <br />or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal <br />department or agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-<br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);<br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (JUL 2013)<br />(a) Definitions.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

L. 113-235), Government <br />agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) <br />under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or <br />subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal <br />confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such <br />employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a <br />designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or <br />agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene <br />requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by <br />a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. <br />(c) Representation.

<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-<br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);<br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (JUL 2013)<br />(a) Definitions.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes.

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.14; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

Delivery arrangements must be coordinated with ordering official prior to delivery for each order. <br />A DELIVERY TICKET must accompany the weigh ticket also, allowing for a signature of a person making the delivery and a signature of government personnel receiving the hay cubes, obtained from the same weighing station. The Contractor shall provide the Government with a certified copy of the loaded weight ticket at the time of each delivery, which must be obtained at an Official Weighing Station with the firm's name inscribed on the weigh ticket. The delivery ticket must list the number of bags per load or lot. NOTE: Exception to weigh tickets would be for bags that have certified equal weights and each bag is marked, thus weigh tickets would not be required. If weigh tickets are not presented, the Government reserves the right to weigh random bags upon delivery. Partial deliveries of a minimum quantity may be requested. <br />Bags shall be loaded and delivered on returnable or disposable pallets so that hay cubes can be unloaded by a Government Forklift Operator at the Government facility. If returnable pallets are used, they shall be provided at no additional cost to the Government and the Contractor shall be responsible for pick-up and return of these pallets after delivery.<br />NOTE: Items purchased under this contract will be used to feed animals in the conduction of research.

L. 113-235), Government <br />agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) <br />under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or <br />subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal <br />confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such <br />employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a <br />designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or <br />agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene <br />requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by <br />a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. <br />(c) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not <br />require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or <br />abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise <br />restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, <br />or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal <br />department or agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-<br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);<br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (JUL 2013)<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-<br />"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings).

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes- <br />(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted</p>

L. 113-235), Government <br />agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) <br />under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or <br />subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal <br />confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such <br />employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a <br />designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or <br />agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene <br />requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by <br />a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. <br />(c) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not <br />require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or <br />abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise <br />restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, <br />or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal <br />department or agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-<br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);<br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (JUL 2013)<br />(a) Definitions.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.<br />(h) Multiple awards.

<p>52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)<br />This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer.

<p>(a) The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information.<br />(b) The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest is<br />discovered after award, the Contractor will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting<br />Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or<br />proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize<br />the actual or potential conflict.<br />(c) The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential organizational conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(d) The Contractor further agrees to insert provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder.</p>
<p>FAR 52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance (JUL 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes- <br />(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.14; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at http://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

  (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.

  (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.

    (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-
        (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
        (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
        (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
      (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.

    (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>a) BACKGROUND. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns/operates two WP-3 Lockheed Orion (WP-3) aircraft in various locations throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It has been determined that one of these WP-3 aircraft will be based out of the Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada area to be operated in support of critical winter storm/ocean wind related research. Due to winter weather conditions in the Halifax area, it is necessary that the WP-3 aircraft be kept in a hangar during the period on or about January 11, 2016 thru on or about February 16, 2016. The hangar will protect the aircraft and it's instrumentation from the environment as well as protects the flight crew and maintenance personnel while performing routine maintenance and pre and post-flight activities through the winter months.</p>
<p>SCOPE:<br />NOAA WP-3 aircraft will be operating out of Halifax, Canada in support of winter storms/ocean winds research. There will be several NOAA WP-3 mechanics in Halifax supporting the aircraft at all times except for short periods when the mechanic's services are requested to support aircraft in other locations. Only one WP-3 will be required in the hangar.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide heated hangar space for one (1) WP-3 having a wing span of 100 feet, length 116 feet and 39 feet high at the tail. Note that the aircraft is equipped with a 105 inch (8.75 ft) air chemistry nose boom sensor that extends from the forward fuselage and must be taken into <br />account for both hangar length and towing operations. Heated hangar means that the hangar is maintained at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Flight crews shall have access to the aircraft 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The contractor can determine if access will be available using on-site personnel that are available at any time, or if not available, issue keys to the flight crews for the hangar where the aircraft is stored.</p>
<p>Security Clause 1352.239-72 does not apply to the SOW and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>The following services are requested as part of the hangar rental price. If there are extra charges or fees for any of these services in addition to the fixed base hangar rental price, provide separate pricing information for each item:</p>
<p>1 Ground support equipment use including:<br />a) AC and DC external power unit,<br />b) Ground service equipment on an as needed basis,<br />c) Tow vehicle and driver for aircraft movement in and out of hangar.<br />2) Hangar amenities including: tools, equipment, consumables, phones, hi-speed internet access (non-dial up with at least a 1Mbps download/upload speed), heat and DC power,<br />3) 24-hour access for maintenance and flight crew,<br />4) Storage space in hangar for extra gear and equipment 5ftx5ft<br />5) Acceptance of Multiservice Air Card for payment of incidentals.</p>
<p>b) PERFORMANCE PERIOD. The hangar lease is required from on or about January 11, 2016 thru on or about February 16, 2016. However, the Government reserves the right to depart early from the survey site and from use of the hangar without incurring any additional fees or penalties associated with departing earlier than February 16, 2016. At the conclusion of the lease, Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government.</p>
<p>c) INSURANCE. The contractor shall at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $2,000,000.00 to cover the aircraft in the event of fire or any catastrophic damage to the hangar resulting in loss or damage to the aircraft. Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained along with a copy of the insurance certificate.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price contract to Rockwell Collins, Inc., 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA 52498-0505, to include procurement of upgraded kits and installation of the upgraded kits for the Nuclear Planning and Execution System (NPES) and workstations on the E-6B Mercury aircraft. This procurement is pursuant to the authority provided in 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), as implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Under the proposed contract, Rockwell will retrofit five (5) Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) E-6B aircraft and five (5) Block I E-6B aircraft with the upgrade kits for NPES and Workstations. As Rockwell has been the sole developer for the E-6B Block I, they are the only company with the unique tooling, knowledge, experience and technical/configuration data acquired through the Block I contracts to produce the modification kits and perform integration. Award to any other source would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling requirements and result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through competition. <br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, responsible interested parties may submit a capability statement in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received by 8 December 2015.

<DESC>This Request for Quote (RFQ), N62271-16-Q-1040, is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 13 and supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This RFQ intends to result in a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Purchase Order. 

The Naval Postgraduate School has a requirement, to be provided by one vendor, for Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) Loggers. The award will be evaluated on a technically-acceptable-lowest-price basis. The NAICS associated with this purchase is 334519 as an unrestricted business size competitive procurement.

The Oceanography Department of the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) requires a quantity of four (4) commercially available CTD Loggers for academic research and education.
   

To study environmental impacts on underwater sound, the oceanographic structure and its variability needs to be well-resolved with measurements of salinity, temperature and depth using a recording CTD instrument. NPS Requires self-recording CTD loggers for collecting time series data using moorings deployed in complex and poorly understood environments.

<p>QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN</p>
<p>USAMRIID Equipment Contract Contract Number:<br />Contractor's name:</p>
<p>1. PURPOSE.</p>
<p>This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) provides a systematic method to evaluate performance for the stated contract. This QASP explains the following:<br />&bull; What will be monitored.<br />&bull; How monitoring will take place.<br />&bull; Who will conduct the monitoring.<br />&bull; How monitoring efforts and results will be documented.</p>
<p>This QASP does not detail how the contractor accomplishes the work. Rather, the QASP is created with the premise that the contractor is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. It is the Government's responsibility to be objective, fair, and consistent in evaluating performance. In addition, the QASP should recognize that unforeseen and uncontrollable situations may occur.</p>
<p>This QASP is a "living document" and the Government may review and revise it on a regular basis. However, the Government shall coordinate changes with the contractor. Updates shall ensure that the QASP remains a valid,<br />useful, and enforceable document. Copies of the original QASP and revisions shall be provided to the contractor and Government officials implementing surveillance activities.</p>

<p>4. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.<br />Performance standards define desired services. The Government performs surveillance to determine if the<br />contractor exceeds, meets or does not meet these standards.<br />The Performance Requirements Summary Matrix, shown in Table 1 below and contained in the Performance<br />Work Statement (PWS) for this contract in paragraph 4.5.2, includes performance standards. The Government<br />shall use these standards to determine contractor performance and shall compare contractor performance to the<br />Acceptable Quality Level (AQL).<br />&emsp;</p>
<p>Table 1. Performance Standards for Initial Outfitting and Transition (IO&amp;T)<br />Acquisition for National Capital Region (NCR) North (WRNMMC)<br />and South (FBCH) Projects</p>

Monthly Reports and 100% Inspection by the COR Favorable Past Performance Rating</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. METHODS OF QA SURVEILLANCE.</p>
<p>Various methods exist to monitor performance. The COR shall use the surveillance methods listed below in the<br />administration of this QASP.</p>
<p>&bull; Feedback from Government Users<br />&bull; Direct Observation<br />&bull; 100% Inspection<br />&bull; Review of Monthly Reports (various)</p>
<p>Regardless of the surveillance method, the COR shall always contact the contractor's task manager or on-site<br />representative when a defect is identified and inform the manager of the specifics of the problem. The COR shall be<br />responsible for monitoring the contractor's performance in meeting a specific performance standard/AQL.</p>
<p>&bull; DIRECT OBSERVATION. (Can be performed periodically or through 100% surveillance.)<br />&bull; MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MIS). (Evaluates outputs through the use of <br />management information reports. Best used for general surveillance and may need to be supplemented<br />by periodic inspections.)<br />&bull; PERIODIC INSPECTION. Uses a comprehensive evaluation of selected outputs. Inspections may be<br />scheduled as required.</p>
<p>o Analysis of contractor's progress reports. (Evaluate cost, schedule, etc.)<br />o Performance reporting.</p>
<p>Surveillance results may be used as the basis for actions (to include payment deductions) against the contractor. In<br />such cases, the Inspection of Services clause and the Inspection of Supplies clause in the Contract becomes the basis<br />for the KO's actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. RATINGS.<br />Metrics and methods are designed to determine if performance exceeds, meets, or does not meet a given standard<br />and acceptable quality level. A rating scale shall be used to determine a positive, neutral, or negative outcome. The<br />following ratings shall be used:</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONAL: Performance significantly exceeds contract requirements to the Government's benefit.<br />SATISFACTORY: Performance meets contractual requirements.<br />UNSATISFACTORY: Performance does not meet contractual requirements.</p>
<p>7. DOCUMENTING PERFORMANCE.</p>
<p>a. ACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE.</p>
<p>The Government shall document positive performance. A report template is attached. Any report may become a<br />part of the supporting documentation for fixed fee payments, award fee payments, or other actions.</p>
<p>b. UNACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE.</p>
<p>When unacceptable performance occurs, the COR shall inform the contractor. This will normally be in writing<br />unless circumstances necessitate verbal communication. In any case the COR shall document the discussion and<br />place it in the COR file.</p>
<p>When the COR determines formal written communication is required, the COR shall prepare a Contract<br />Discrepancy Report (CDR), and present it to the contractor's task manager or on-site representative. A CDR<br />template is attached to this QASP.</p>
<p>The contractor shall acknowledge receipt of the CDR in writing. The CDR will specify if the contractor is required<br />to prepare a corrective action plan to document how the contractor shall correct the unacceptable performance and<br />avoid a recurrence. The CDR will also state how long after receipt the contractor has to present this corrective<br />action plan to the COR. The Government shall review the contractor's corrective action plan to determine<br />acceptability.</p>
<p>Any CDRs may become a part of the supporting documentation for contract payment deductions, fixed fee<br />deductions, award fee nonpayment, or other actions deemed necessary by the KO.</p>
<p>8. FREQUENCY OF MEASUREMENT.</p>
<p>a. Frequency of Measurement.</p>
<p>During contract/order performance, the COR shall take periodic measurements, quarterly as specified in the AQL<br />column of the Performance Standards Summary Matrix, and shall analyze whether the negotiated frequency of<br />measurement is appropriate for the work being performed.</p>

<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>

<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br /><br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>1.1. Award of a single contract shall be made on a competitive basis, using the best value tradeoff process among price and non-price factors described at FAR 15.101-1. The resulting contract is expected to be firm-fixed-price.</p>
<p>1.2. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>1.3. Award of this contract will be made on a competitive best value basis, using tradeoffs among price and non-price factors. Thus, the Government may elect to award to other than the lowest priced offeror, or other than the highest technically rated offeror. Past Performance will be evaluated independently from the other non-price evaluation factors using different standards. The evaluation factors are listed below in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Capability<br />Factor 2 - Experience<br />Factor 3 - Past Performance<br />Factor 4 - Price</p>
<p>1.4. The Government will not assume that the offeror possesses any capability or knowledge unless it is specified in the proposal.</p>
<p>1.5. After Factors 1 and 2 are rated individually, an overall rating will be assigned to these factors collectively. If Factor 1 or 2 receives an individual rating of "Unacceptable," the overall rating will also be "Unacceptable." Proposals that receive a rating of "Marginal" for Factor 1 or 2 will not be considered in the tradeoff process. Only proposals receiving an overall rating of "Acceptable" or higher will be considered for award.</p>
<p><br />2 EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>2.1. Factor 1 - Technical Capability: The technical capability will be evaluated for the degree to which the Offeror's technical capability demonstrates a clear understanding of the PWS and all the tasks to be performed;, the methodology and flexibility that will be utilized;, and how the approach will accomplish all tasks, subtasks, and administrative tasks as are necessary to ensure program success within the proposal's required time frame. This capability will be evaluated for the degree to which the technical capability demonstrates a clear working knowledge of a sterilization system in a Government laboratory. Technical capability shall include the procedures for daily operation, preventive and corrective maintenance in Bio Safety Level (BSL) 1, BSL2, BSL3 or BSL4 containment.</p>
<p>2.2. Factor 2 - Experience: The Offeror's proposal will be evaluated to the degree to which the Offeror's proposal reflects experience identical to, similar to, or related to performing services contained within the PWS. The experience will be evaluated to the degree to which the Offeror demonstrates relevant experience in providing the services to maintain a sterilization system in government medical research laboratories, specifically biomedical laboratories identical, similar or related to this PWS. Offeror proposals will be evaluated to the degree proposals cite specific examples of relevant experience in the areas of basic and complex operation of a sterilization system; preventive maintenance of a sterilization system; corrective maintenance (including spare part) of a sterilization system; and information technology and management experience of maintaining a sterilization system .</p>
<p>2.3. Factor 3 - Past Performance: Past performance shall be evaluated on the basis of the offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in services that meet the contract's requirements. The Government will conduct a past performance risk evaluation and confidence assessment of the offeror that will be based on the relevance, recency, and quality of the offeror's past performance on projects of similar size, scope, and complexity within similar periods of performance.</p>
<p>a. Offerors shall submit a list of no more than two (2) references familiar with the offeror's performance on relevant contracts within the past three (3) years. It is the offeror's responsibility to provide valid, current, and verifiable references. References must include the following information:</p>
<p>i. Name of the organization that will be providing the reference<br />ii. Name of the point of contact (POC) familiar with contract performance<br />iii. POC telephone number<br />iv. POC email address<br />v. Contract number<br />vi. Period of performance<br />vii. Summary of the scope of work performed</p>
<p>b. The Government will review the relevant and recent past performance information to determine the risks associated with an offeror's probability of successfully performing the required efforts.</p>
<p>c. The Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources. Other sources available to the Government include, but are not limited to, the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).</p>
<p>d. In the case of an Offeror who has no recent/relevant performance record available or the Offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the Offeror will be determined to have "Unknown Confidence" for its past performance evaluation factor.</p>
<p><br />2.4. Factor 4 - Price: Price will be evaluated separately from non-price and past performance factors. A price analysis will be performed in order to evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed price. The Government will evaluate the consistency, completeness, fairness and reasonableness of the Offeror's cost/price proposal.</p>
<p>The base contract(s) shall contain the Clause FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services, or an equivalent clause. By submitting a proposal for this requirement, the contractor agrees to this inclusion in the base contract.</p>
<p>Option Year Periods. The Government will evaluate the offers for award purposes by examining the labor rate for all options based on the basic estimated labor utilization for the requirement. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>The evaluated price with be the total of the base year plus all option periods.</p>
<p>3. EVALUATION RATING STANDARDS</p>
<p>3.1. RATING STANDARDS FOR THE NON-PRICE PROPOSAL (EXCLUDING PAST PERFORMANCE)</p>
<p>Combined Technical/Risk Ratings Table<br />Rating Description<br />Outstanding Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low.<br />Good Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low.<br />Acceptable Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.<br />Marginal Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable.</p>
<p>3.2. RATING STANDARDS FOR PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Past Performance Relevancy Ratings Table<br />Rating Description<br /><br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved at least some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br /><br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Performance Confidence Assessments Table<br />Rating Description<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror shall successfully perform the required effort. <br />Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror shall successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offer shall successfully perform the required effort.<br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror shall successfully perform the required effort.<br />Unknown Confidence (Neutral) No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p><br />4. DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>Term Definition<br />Clarifications Limited exchanges between the Government and offerors that may occur when award without discussions is contemplated.<br />Communications Exchanges, between the Government and offerors, after receipt of proposals, leading to establishment of the competitive range.<br />Deficiency A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weakness in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. See FAR 15.001.<br />Discussions Negotiations conducted in a competitive acquisition. Discussions take place after establishment of the competitive range.<br />Performance Confidence Assessment An evaluation of the likelihood (or Government's confidence) that the offeror will successfully perform the solicitation's requirements; the evaluation is based upon past performance information.<br />Recency As it pertains to past performance information, is a measure of the time that has elapsed since the past performance reference occurred. Recency is generally expressed as a time period during which past performance references are considered relevant.<br />Relevancy As it pertains to past performance information, is a measure of the extent of similarity between the service/support effort, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and subcontract/teaming or other comparable attributes of past performance examples and the source solicitation requirements; and a measure of the likelihood that the past performance is an indicator of future performance.<br />Risk The potential for unsuccessful contract performance. The consideration of risk assesses the degree to which an offeror's proposed approach to achieving the technical factor or subfactor may involve risk of disruption of schedule, increased cost (not applicable to firm-fixed-price contract) for degradation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. <br />Significant Weakness A flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. See FAR 15.001.<br />Significant Strength An aspect of an Offeror's proposal that has appreciable merit or appreciably exceeds specified performance or capability requirements in a way that will be appreciably advantageous to the Government during contract performance.<br />Strength An aspect of an Offeror's proposal that has merit or exceeds specified performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance.<br />Weakness A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. See FAR 15.001.</p>

<p>USAMRAA Local Instructions</p>
<p>Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) (June 2015) (USAMRAA)</p>
<p>A CPAR assesses a contractor's performance and provides a record, both positive and negative, on a given contractor during a specific period of time. Each assessment is based on objective facts and supported by program and contract management data, such as cost performance reports, customer comments, quality reviews, technical interchange meetings, financial solvency assessments, construction/production management reviews, contractor operations reviews, functional performance evaluations, and earned contract incentives. Performance evaluations are transmitted into the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) which is used by government agencies to assess contractor past performance for future acquisitions. The contractor shall appoint a Contractor Representative (CR) and provide this information to the Contracting Officer (KO) within 10 calendar days of award. The contractor POC shall have the authority to comment on the CPAR assessment on behalf of their company and within the timeframes established.</p>
<p>A CPARS assessment must be completed within 120 calendar days after the evaluation. Evaluations are sent to PPIRS within 14 calendar days after the government Assessing Official (AO) has submitted the rating. If the CR has not concurred/non-concurred with the rating; PPIRS will show the government evaluation as "Contractor Comment Pending Review". The CR has a total of 60 calendar days to concur/non-concur with the assessment. After 60 days, the CR can either concur/non-cur. The CR has the authority to: access the Government evaluation; review/comment/concur or non-concur with the assessment within 60 calendar days after notification of the government's assessment. The CR has the right to request a meeting (in writing) with the government within 7 calendar days of notification of an assessment. Once the government and the CR complete the evaluation; an automatic update will be sent to PPIRS and visible for Source Selection. If the CR fails to respond within 60 days, the assessment will be finalized. Training for CPARS can be found on the CPARS website: https://www.cpars.gov/index.htm.<br /><br />To access CPARS, the contractor must have a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). It is suggested an ECA certificate of Medium Assurance should be purchased. This should be a Department of Defense identity certificate, not an e-mail certificate.</p>

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) is the Nation's federal health sciences university and is committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war. We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense and the United States Public Health Service and with scientists who serve the common good. We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness. USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda.<br /><br />USU intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Marshall Farms Group (dba Marshall BioResources), located in North Rose, New York for a two (2) year indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for Gottingen minipigs.<br /><br />These animals will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to include FAR Subpart 13.5, Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.<br /><br />Sole source determination is made in accordance with:<br /><br />FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition<br /><br />(b) Soliciting from a single source<br /><br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.<br /><br />For the past seven (7) years Gottingen minipigs (Marshall BioResources, NY, USA) have been utilized in continued research projects at the University.  The Gottingen minipig is the smallest minipig available with limited inbreeding and high quality microbiological and genetic background.  They are accepted non-rodent models in pharmacology and toxicology.  The animals are barrier bred and raised in special state-of-the-art barrier production facilities, and therefore free from any porcine infectious bacteria, viral or parasitic disease.  The Gottingen minipig is specifically bred for research purposes.<br /><br />The Gottingen strain of minipig has full genetic background available and a large body of background data which can be used for quality control.  The many similarities between pigs and humans makes this species an excellent model for disease research and the small size and microbiologically defined health status of the Gottingen makes it a unique swine model for toxicology.  The small size is essential to enable animal handling and irradiation, reduce experimental variation due to inhomogeneous exposure to ionizing radiation, and minimize cost for new drug development.<br /><br />Marshall Farms Group is the only known source that can provide the requested equipment.
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.  Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses must be received via email (sherri.ori@usuhs.edu) by 3:00 p.m. EST on December 24, 2015.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component repair/overhaul services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair/overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair/overhaul of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-16-Q-010035 is assigned for tracking purposes only. Federal Acquisition Regulations 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5 apply. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-84. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to the OEM or a fully capable repair vendor.
<p>Any vendor, except the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or a Production Approval Holder (PAH), repairing Coast Guard Aircraft Components MUST be FAA 145 certified and perform at least fifty percent (50%) of the work at their company's FAA certified facility. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, awards for the repair or overhaul of Coast Guard Aircraft Repairable Components shall only be awarded directly to service vendors who have been deemed fully capable of performing such services by division level command-appointed Coast Guard Engineers or Equipment Specialists.</p>
<p>Vendors who do not meet the above stated capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond to this solicitation/request for quote.</p>
<p>This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their repair data for capability determination or for registration in SAM.GOV. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS, such vendors should forward any request for capability determination to Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for future awards consideration. The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide service manuals or OEM service data. With their quote, vendors must provide a copy of the first page of the current OEM Manual or Service Reference, and in their quote make reference to it (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789"). Quote must include Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and FOB Point. The Component OEM is Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation and their Cage Code is 73030. The HC-144A Aircraft OEM is AIRBUS DEFENSE AND SPACE SAU EADS CASA, AV. DE ARAGON 404, MADRID, ESP E-28022, Cage Code 0117B, and their domestic repair facility Cage Code is 0DAF1. Any TT&amp;E plus average repair cost quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes received by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical overhaul cost. If a Small Business Set-Aside was applicable, IAW Small Business Administration, under NAICS Code 488190 the Small Business Size Standard is under $32,500,000.00. This solicitation is a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. NAICS Code 488190 is applicable. This solicitation is for the repair of HC-144 Aircraft Component/Part(s):</p>

(a) The Government will award a contract or multiple awards resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, technical, past performance and price considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

BASIS OF AWARD:  1) The government intends to issue a firm fixed price contract or multiple awards to the responsible Offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation evaluation factors. 

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: 
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the Offer that meets the technical aspects of the solicitation.  Competing offeror's technical aspects will be evaluated as significantly more important than past performance and price considerations. The lowest price proposal may not necessarily be selected; likewise, the proposal receiving the highest technical rating may not necessarily be selected.  Offerors who propose to perform the work for an unrealistically low price will not be considered for award. Where applicable, the techniques and procedures described under FAR 15.404-1 will be the primary means of assessing proposal reasonableness. An offeror's proposal shall represent the offeror's best efforts to respond to the solicitation. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offeror's must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: 

A.	Technical: Technical can be measured by the offeror's ability to perform requirements to meet technical, specifications, contract terms and conditions, and all local, state, and federal regulations as related to performing projects. 
1.	Contractor shall have a minimum of five (5) years of experience for storage and maintenance of medical cache.

2.	Contractor staff shall have medical training to ensure that VA Patient Reception Team (VA-PRT) cache is maintained in a ready to respond state at all times. Medical Cache shall be stored local to Denver.

3.	Contractor shall provide training as needed to VA-PRT as needed.

4.	Contractor shall be able to mobilize medical cache within four (4) hours of notice to a specified location deemed by VA Personnel.

5.	Contractor shall participate in Functional Exercises as necessary.

6.	Contractor shall explain in technical proposal how they shall provide these services.

   Rating Definitions:
               
Rating	Definition/Standard

Excellent 	Proposal demonstrates superior understanding of requirements and approach that exceeds performance or capability standards.  Has several strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is minimal.

Good
	Proposal demonstrates a good understanding of requirements and approach that meets performance or capability standards.  Has one or more strengths that will benefit the Government.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is low.

Satisfactory
	Proposal demonstrates an acceptable understanding of requirements and approach that can meet performance or capability standards.  Acceptable solutions are identified.  No strengths are identified.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate. 

Marginal	Proposal demonstrates shallow understanding of requirements and approach that marginally meets performance or capability standards.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is moderately high.
Unsatisfactory	Proposal fails to demonstrate an understanding of requirements or capability standards.  Requirements can only be met with major changes to the proposal.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is high.






B.	 Past Performance Confidence Assessment: 
1)	Past Performance, the offeror shall provide relevant performance information on all Offerors based on (1) the past and present references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources as well as questionnaires. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving contracting support that is similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. Past Performance that does not meet the recency requirement, will be excluded from evaluation. 

2) Past performance will address areas pertaining to the following attributes to which an assessment will be made: 
3) Quality: The quality of work can be measured by how well the offeror conformed to or met contract requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g. commonly accepted technical professional, environmental, or safety and health standards.) 

. 
TABLE 1- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS 
Rating 	Description 
SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
LIMITED CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
NO CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. 
UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE 	No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. 

4) Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offeror's with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating ?Unknown Confidence, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. 

5) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP. For each effort evaluated, a relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners, will be made. In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. The following relevancy definitions apply: VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. SOMEWHAT-RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. NOT RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs did not involve any magnitude of effort and complex.

6) Recent past performance is defined as past performance on contracts within the last three years from the issue date of this solicitation. Past performance for contracts exceeding the timeframe for this definition of recency will be excluded from evaluation. 

7) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a ?Substantial Confidence? performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. 
(a) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>(viii) <strong>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items</strong>, applies.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation is the lowest price technically acceptable quotation. Quotations will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offer. The Government will evaluate "Key Personnel" and "Past Performance" to determine if a quote is considered technically acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Key Personnel</strong><br />Key personnel are defined as the quoter's proposed employees responsible for providing regular ASL Interpreting Services. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quoters shall submit a one-page resume for all individuals proposed as key personnel.</span></strong> Interpreters shall have a minimum of three years continuous experience in performing similar interpreting services in a diverse office environment.</p>
<p>The Key Personnel factor will receive a rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable" based on its entirety. In order to receive an "acceptable" rating, Quoters must demonstrate that all key personnel proposed have sufficient relevant experience to indicate they have the knowledge and capability to successfully perform their assigned roles. If proposed key personnel are replaced during the execution of this project, replacement personnel must have equal or better qualifications as those proposed and must be approved by the Contracting Officer before they perform work. (See 452.237-74 KEY PERSONNEL (FEB 1988.) Missing, incomplete, or ambiguous information could result in a rating of "unacceptable".</p>
<p><strong>Past Performance</strong><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quoters must provide Past Performance references for at least three (3) projects for work performed by the Quoter within the last three years</span></strong>. Include the project title, description, dollar value, dates performed, location, and contact information (name, title, phone, and email address).

<p>The Government may contact any or all of the past performance references provided by the Offeror in response to this solicitation, and may also use information obtained from any other sources when evaluating past performance. The past performance factor will receive a rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable" based on its entirety. Past performance will be rated "unacceptable" if the contractor receives an unsatisfactory rating from references unless the offeror can demonstrate that adequate corrective actions were taken. In the case of an Offeror with no relevant performance history, or for whom no information on past performance is available, the Offeror will be evaluated as "acceptable" provided the Offeror certifies that additional past performance information is not available and provides an acceptable explanation as to why past performance information is not available.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>Amendment 0001 is hereby issued to change the response due date to Friday, 12/04/2015 by 1:00 PM.&nbsp; All other terms and conditions remain the same.<br /><br /><br />The U.S. Department of Transportation, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, has a requirement to purchase a mobile eye tracking system. Procurement of this system will support the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) in their mission to reduce and prevent rail accidents.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. DTRT5716Q80039 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-83, effective November 01, 2015. The NAICS Code is 333314; the Small Business size standard is 500 Employees. This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK - Begin <br /><br />Introduction/Background<br />The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, issues this Statement of Work (SOW) in support of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) in their mission to reduce and prevent rail accidents. The purpose of this request is for the Volpe Center to acquire an eye tracking system to collect driver gaze information while operating a simulated locomotive. This system will include recordings of eye movements, driver scan and search patterns in a three-dimensional space in which the driver's head may rotate. The system will be primarily used in the FRA's Cab Technology Integration Laboratory (CTIL) rail simulator, but may be used in the field during future experiments.<br /><br />Scope of Work<br /><br />The central deliverable to the government is the supply and installation of a tool which tracks subject gaze locations in a 3d, multi-surface environment and the requisite tools for analysing its data and isolating it based on specific areas of interest. The Government also requires that the hardware allows for extensive subject mobility. The reasoning for this is twofold. Firstly, the simulator in which it will be installed is reconfigurable, and it is essential that the eye tracker can function without repositioning of equipment. Secondly, subjects are likely to be wearing any eye tracker headgear for periods of over an hour, and this is why the Government needs an untethered light system.<br /><br />Period of Performance<br /><br />The Contractor shall deliver and configure all components and provide any necessary training within sixty (60) days from the date of the award.<br />Place of Performance<br />The Contractor shall provide on-site installation, demonstration and any training at the Volpe Center in Cambridge, MA, in the FRA's Cab Technology Integration Laboratory (CTIL). <br /><br />Requirements<br /><br />In meeting the Volpe Center's minimum requirements, the system shall:<br />1. Have head mounted optics which are lightweight (less than seventy grams).<br />2. Maintain accuracy while the subject is wearing corrective lenses, including bifocals and progressive bifocals.<br />3. Work with a wide array of eyeglass frame designs, or provide vision correction so that subjects' glasses could potentially be removed while wearing the device.<br />4. Function in both light and dark-light conditions.<br />5. Function for more than four hours, if the device requires batteries.<br />6. Include a second battery, if the device requires the use of a battery.<br />7. Integrate into a Government-procured rail simulator and be transferable to other simulators or field vehicles.<br />8. Function "untethered." That is, provide for free motion of subject's head, and extensive subject mobility without being directly attached to a laptop or larger device.<br />9. Resolve and record position of handheld devices or clipboard.<br />10. Have a short setup/calibration time (&lt;2 minutes) and calibrate using five or fewer calibration points.<br />11. Receive a TTL signal from an external source and either include a column in the output showing the signal state, or use the signal as a marker in the data file. This signal will be used to align the eye tracker's data with other data sources from the simulator.<br />12. Be capable of subject data recalibration after collection, and use the new calibration for analysis.<br />13. Allow for repair without replacing the entire unit.<br />14. Have analysis tools which reduce the raw eye tracking data to fixations.<br />15. Have analysis tools which automate gaze data analysis to avoid relying on frame-by-frame analysis.<br />16. Have analysis tools which automatically identify eye fixation locations based on researcher-defined areas of interest.<br />17. Be capable of producing accurate data without a separate head-tracking system.<br />18. Function in an environment that is comprised mostly of aluminium and steel.<br />19. Be configured by the contractor to operate with remote oversight in a room adjacent to where the subject is wearing the equipment (the Government will provide a computer for this function).<br />20. Be supported by the contractor for a period of at least a year.<br />21. Have components that maintain a temperature below 105 degrees if they come into contact with the subject's face or head.<br /><br />Acceptance Criteria<br /><br />The Government will consider the Contractors work complete when the system has been installed onsite, configured to work properly, and the system has been demonstrated to two Volpe Center employees (both to learn how to operate the system and to ensure that it meets the Requirements). Demonstration will include calibration in light and dark environments (as well as with various types of glasses), data recording while subject's head is moving, any requisite gaze mapping, data reduction and simulator timing.</p>

ADDITIONAL REFERENCE AND LICENSE INFORMATION
N65236-16-Q-1202
Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Atlantic (SSC Atlantic) requests competitive small business quotes for the following BRAND NAME ONLY requirement for Rapid7 (Formally NTO Spider).  NTO Spider's comprehensive application coverage combined with its sophisticated attack methodologies deliver the best rate in the industry for the elimination of false positive and false negative findings.  The product permits partial testing, full testing; CAC authentication testing, customizable depths/crawls, and is the only known product to effectively execute against java servlets and JavaScript execution engines.  Unlike other pater-based scanners, NTO Spider crawls the site to learn about it, then creates customize attacks which are specific to the site evaluated.  Attempting to change the current software suite would require 6 months to one year to acquire, test, and certify a new product.  Additional lapse in coverage could lead to system vulnerabilities.      Rapid7 is the manufacturer of this software, and the manufacturer has the proprietary rights to the software.  The following is the BRAND NAME ONLY Requirement:

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.<br />***Past performance is significantly more important than price.***</p>
<p><br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Past Performance</p>
<p>(a) The Government will evaluate the offerors past performance information for quality and confidence. The offeror shall identify at least two relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years.</p>
<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a) (2). The quality of past performance and relevance of experience to the Coast Guard will be evaluated. The ability to manage and maintain a qualified workforce will be considered. Customer satisfaction will be an integral consideration. In evaluating past performance the Government will consider contracts performed during the last 3 years. Emphasis will be placed upon the contractor's administration of the contractual responsibilities. For example:</p>
<p>(1) Adequacy of contract start up. <br />(2) Performance in accordance with proposed method of performance. <br />(3) Sufficiency of proposed personnel to perform contract. <br />(4) Filling of key positions with qualified individuals. <br />(5) Quality performance of work. <br />(6) Response to emergency situations. <br />(7) Schedule adherence (including administrative aspects of performance.) <br />(8) Responsiveness to Government requirements. <br />(9) Performance in accordance with contract requirements. <br />(10) Customer satisfaction. <br />(11) Complete submittals. <br />(12) Timely delivery of paperwork. <br />(13) Timely and accurate invoice submittals <br />(14) Quality of drawings. <br />(15) Knowledge of Customer Requirements and Expectations. <br />(16) Management and cost control of subcontracts</p>
<p>Following the quality evaluation, the Government will assign an overall confidence rating to each past performance reference, considering both the relevance and quality of the provided reference. The Government will then assign a composite past performance confidence rating for the vendor's overall past performance, considering the confidence ratings assigned to each individual reference. The confidence evaluation will be in accordance with the following table</p>
<p>Past Performance Quality Rating:<br />Rating Definition<br />Exceptional Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being evaluated was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.<br />Very Good Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being evaluated was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.<br />Satisfactory Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory.</p>
<p>Marginal Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being evaluated reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.<br />Unsatisfactory Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.<br />Neutral The offeror has no past performance history OR the Contracting Officer has determined that the past performance information provided is not directly related or similar to the requirements in the RFP</p>
<p>(b) The Government may review Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) ratings <br />on relevant contracts and may also consider Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) <br />ratings, regulatory agency databases, past performance questionnaires, information submitted by each <br />Offeror with its quote, and other existing past performance information contained in either local or <br />other supervisor files, or from other Government sources or non-Government sources. Offerors are <br />advised that in evaluating an Offeror's past performance, the Government may, in its sole discretion, <br />consider information from sources outside the Offeror's quote. For example, the Government may <br />consider information based on its own experience with the Offeror and/or may contact the parties for <br />whom the Offeror performed contracts and consider their response when evaluating the Offeror's <br />quote. General trends in a contractor's performance will also be considered. In the case of an Offeror <br />without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not <br />available, they will not receive a favorable or unfavorable rating.</p>
<p>The assessment of the Offeror's Past Performance is one of the factors used for evaluating the <br />Offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements of this solicitation as well as to determine <br />the Offeror's performance risk for the subject solicitation. Such consideration is separate and distinct <br />from the Contracting Officer's responsibility determination under FAR 9. The Government reserves <br />the right to contact references provided by the Offeror, and otherwise verify statements and <br />representations made in the Offeror's quote, but reserves the right not to contact.</p>
<p>2. Price</p>
<p>The total price of the offeror will be determined by totaling the proposed prices of all the Definite Items and the Composite Labor Hour extended total, plus lay days and foreseeable costs. Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>Price quote will be reviewed for completeness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>1. Is the incumbent eligible to bid on this requirement?</p>
<p>1a. Answer: No<br /><br />2. What is the best way to schedule a walk through for interested parties?</p>
<p>2a. Answer: The NRC will post a schedule for walk-throughs for interested parties after the solicitation has been released.</p>
<p>3. I am not able to find any defined labor categories and position descriptions. It would be great to get position descriptions.</p>
<p>3a. Answer: The labor categories and descriptions are included in the SOW and will be released with the RFP.</p>
<p>4. Outside of the two contractor FTEs are there any contractor support staff in region 4?</p>
<p>4a. Answer: There is no contractor support staff in region 4 at this time. At the option of the NRC and subject to the availability of funds the NRC may employ contractor support to the regional offices.</p>
<p>5. What percentage of the forecasted contract value is associated with technology refresh?</p>
<p>5a. Answer: 10%</p>
<p>6. $13M value: Given that the requirement is "Providing two full-time, on-site security-cleared contractor personnel" this seems rather a high value. Is this due to an increase in scope? Or because of Other Direct Costs (ODCs)?</p>
<p>6a. At the option of the NRC and subject to the availability of funds the NRC may issue task orders for all 4 IRCs, the estimate for this effort is $5.5M.</p>

The cattle being purchased will be used for an experiment to evaluate a vaccine for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) strain of serotype C of importance for preparing a potential stock pile vaccine. The vaccine will be tested in the current and approved PD50 cattle study. Animal procurement is a complex operation, necessitating compliance with animal transport regulations, oversight by the (PIADC) Attending Veterinarian to ensure that healthy animals are sourced from approved vendors, and logistical coordination among facility administrative, support, and animals care personnel. As specified by the PIADC Animal Research Branch (ARB), animals may only be purchased from vendors possessing accreditation by Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) or certified by USDA.

<p>Title: Small Glide Munitions</p>
<p>Classification Code: 13- Ammunition<br />NAICS Code: 332993</p>
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT/ REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />Description: The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Rapid Acquisition Cell, Eglin AFB, is seeking interested and qualified sources to provide a Small Glide Munition (SGM) to the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Standoff Precision Guided Munition (SOPGM) capability that meets the attached operational requirement of the U.S. Special Operations Forces. Proposal are not being requested or accepted at this time. The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 332993 - Ammunition (except Small Arms) Manufacturing with a standard size of 1500 persons. Respondents should indicate their size in relation to this size standard and indicate socio-economic status (i.e. SB, 8(a), HUBZone, EDWOSB, WOSB, or SDVOSB). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR Clause 52.219-14. Only interested firms who believe they are capable of providing the supplies and services noted in the SOW and can meet these requirements are invited to respond to this notice.</p>

Proposals are not being requested or accepted at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. Failure to provide documentation may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. Sources shall include in their information: company's full name, cage code, Data Universal<br />Numbering System (DUNS) number, a detailed capabilities statement asserting their capabilities in providing the products and services described in this notice, a point of contract with phone and e-mail information, business status (Socio-Economic Factors: 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business, etc), and business<br />size based on NAICS 332993.</p>

What are the quality requirements? <br />Answer: AS9110 </span></p>
<p>2. Does the government have the tooling and or tooling specifications for the Weapons Bay Door? <br />Answer: The government has a portion of the tooling and we have a tooling list. We also have the complete tooling of the other three (3) doors that can be viewed by any contractor, but not taken or removed from Hill AFB. Viewing of tooling in Salt Lake City, UT possible during week of Aug 24-28. Notify 424.SCMS.AFMC.RFI.Responses@tinker.af.mil if interested. The 424SCMS, managing this project, does not own the partial tooling available on this particular item (CMXG at Hill AFB owns the tooling). As such, it is not clear if this tooling would be available as government furnished materiel.</p>
<p>3. To what extent must the Bay Door be tested? <br />Answer: It must pass Form Fit Function requirement, demonstrated by test fit on B-2 Aircraft.</p>
<p>4. The Contractor would like to know, since this is a prototype this is going to be produced, can they use cheaper material for prototype production to save time? Answer: Yes you may for preliminary FFF testing to reduce production risk, but the final accepted version must use approved original specified materials, and prove Form/Fit/Function at Edwards AFB.</p>
<p>5. How many planes are expected to be surveyed? <br />Answer: Government will do any surveying if necessary, and contractor involvement can be discussed. Additionally, loft data for aircraft surfaces is available.</p>
<p>6. Is the contractor allowed to repair the prototype door as necessary? <br />Answer: The prototype stage is considered past Critical Design Review (CDR). As such, a MRB action would need government approval. Depending on many factors, the flight suitability of a door would be assessed based on the MRB's against it.</p>
<p>7. Is there any potential for follow-on work? <br />Answer: Possibly. There are currently no spares, and the requirement is 1 to 3. A vendor successful with this project would be a future source of supply for this item should any future requirements arise.</p>
<p>8. Are there any Time Compliance Tech Orders (TCTO's) on the door? <br />Answer: none known.</p>
<p>9. Are rigging instructions available, which may show additional clearance tolerance for fit? <br />Answer: The document is controlled by the B-2 System Program Office, and disclosure may not be possible.</p>
<p>10. Dimensions? <br />Answer: 24ft long, 4ft wide. Tooling would push envelope out roughly a foot in each direction.</p>
<p>11. Will you release process specifications? <br />Answer: As long as the data rights are clear to release.</p>
<p>12. Are the doors a co-cured GR/Ep composite originally with auto-clave cure at 350F? What more can you share as to structural details and material?<br />Answer: Yes, Most all is 3K-70-PW carbon fiber impreg with B-staged epoxy resin (Hexcel 8552S). 350 cure. Also random carbon fiber mat BMS8-302 grade 1. Core : BMS8-124, class 1, type 1 grade varies</p>
<p>13. In repair of such large structure, out-of-autoclave vacuum repairs is proposed where applicable. Is that an acceptable approach for the door?<br />Answer: No, we would not want to qualify another material for this application (Nuclear Capable Bomber).</p>
<p>14. The sources sought mentioned a cure temperature of up to 700F. Those cure temperatures are associated with polyimides or thermoplastics. A Peek resin graphite composite would be a reasonable approach for new construction but not to repair current production doors. I don't see a polyimide composite as needed here.<br />Answer: Up to 700F is listed in the qualification requirement, please list your qualifications and equipment in your RFI response so the USAF can assess capability to produce this item. Materials we expect to encounter are listed above.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />DEPARTMENT OF LABOR<br />THE OFFICE OF DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT POLICY<br />STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS IDIQ</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The United States Department of Labor (DOL), Office of Procurement Services (OPS), in support of the Office of Disability and Employment Policy (ODEP), is seeking information on how any interested and qualified small business can provide services for a new single-award, IDIQ contract for Strategic Communications.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the DOL is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) is a Federal Agency within the Department of Labor (DOL) whose mission is to develop and influence policies and practices to increase the number and quality of employment opportunities for people with disabilities. To realize its mission, ODEP promotes the adoption and implementation of policy strategies and effective practices that are supported by evidence and data that appear to show positive results in the employment of people with disabilities. To that end, ODEP conducts research to identify and develop effective policies and practices, conducts outreach to share this critical information, and provides technical assistance to all levels of government, service providers and non-governmental organizations, and employers in both the public and private sector. ODEP's stakeholders include:<br /><br />&bull; Individuals with disabilities and their families; <br />&bull; Private employers and their employees; <br />&bull; Government employers and their employees;<br />&bull; Federal, state, and local Government agencies; <br />&bull; Educational and training institutions; <br />&bull; Disability advocates; and <br />&bull; Providers of services to individuals with disabilities</p>
<p>Strategic communications are vital to conveying ODEP's policy strategies and outputs, effective practices, technical assistance resources, research activities and other policies and activities to its various stakeholders and the general public. ODEP utilizes numerous outreach and communications strategies to inform and engage their stakeholders in all phases of its work from research and policy development to the dissemination of information about effective policies and practices. By involving stakeholders, and intermediary groups that represent or work with stakeholders (e.g. professional and business associations), ODEP ensures that the policies and practices developed and promoted are responsive to the stakeholders' needs and effective in improving employment opportunities for people with disabilities.</p>
<p><br />All of ODEP's policy-focused teams conduct public engagement and outreach activities around their respective policy issues, utilizing a wide variety of communication strategies to do so. ODEP's Policy Communications and Outreach (PC&amp;O) Division coordinates with these teams and with the Departments' Offices of Public Affairs and of Public Engagement to ensure message consistency within ODEP and in support of the Secretary's priorities. PC&amp;O is responsible for providing communications support for the Assistant Secretary and other ODEP senior leadership and assists in preparing (i.e., writing and editing) briefings, other reports and materials used for planning, management and reporting. PC&amp;O also coordinates with OPA to respond to media inquiries and assists in preparing the Assistant Secretary or others for interviews and other communications activities such as blogs, press releases and presentations. PC&amp;O oversees speechwriting and the creation of materials for publication under the name of members of ODEP senior leadership. PC&amp;O manages the content on ODEP's agency website, which contains regularly updated information about all of ODEP's efforts and serves as a portal to other ODEP-sponsored websites such as those maintained by its various technical assistance centers. PC&amp;O also compiles and distributes a weekly electronic newsletter to its more than 50,000 small business subscribers and monthly electronic newsletter (Business$ense) to approximately 50,000 small businesses. PC&amp;O has the responsibility for conducting the annual National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) campaign and provides logistical and communications support to other events and activities that arise in response to current events or leadership priorities and commitments. All of these efforts, and more, that are managed, performed or coordinated by PC&amp;O are considered ODEP's Strategic Communications and Outreach (SCO) activities.</p>
<p><br />Each of these initiatives is ongoing and recurring and requires continuity from one year to the next. The successful vendor needs to possess communications expertise and understand the disability employment landscape and the nuances of communicating with its varied stakeholders.</p>
<p>2.1 Planned Production: ODEP requires the award of an IDIQ by August 2016, with the a Task Order for The Campaign for Disability Employment to be placed on the date of award.</p>
<p>2.2 Delivery Period: ODEP anticipates award of a single-award IDIQ by August 2016, with the Task Order for the Campaign for Disability Employment's PoP start date on or about August 15, 2016.

<DESC><br />The National Institutes of Health ("NIH"), Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought notice to determine whether there is a reasonable expectation of a responsible/capable offeror to perform the work sought in the attached SOW. Accordingly, NIH is hoping that there exists a reasonable expectation of at least two responsible/capable offerors in order for NIH to compete the requirement. Additionally, NIH is attempting to ascertain if there exists a reasonable expectation of at least two responsible/capable small business offerors in order for NIH to compete the requirement as a small business set aside.
<p>Accordingly, NIH is seeking capability statements as to the attached SOW from other-than-small businesses, small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZONE small businesses, small businesses under the 8(a) program, and/or businesses under the GSA Schedule which can perform on-schedule.</p>
<p>THIS MARKET SURVEY/SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. CONSEQUENTLY, DO NOT SEND A PROPOSAL IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE. THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE IS A CAPABILITY STATEMENT. ALTHOUGH A RESPONDENT CAN RESPOND WITH WHATEVER INFORMATION THE RESPONDENT SEES FIT, THE IDEAL CAPABILITY STATEMENT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE SOW AND THE REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION BELOW, AND IS NOT A GENERIC SALES BROCHURE OR MARKETING HANDOUT. FURTHER, THE GOVERNMENT REQUESTS, BUT DOES NOT MANDATE, THAT THE CAPABILITY STATEMENT IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN TEN PAGES. ANY PROPRIETARY INFORMATION IN THE SUBMITTED CAPABILITY STATEMENT SHOULD BE CLEARLY MARKED AS SUCH.</p>
<p>The information obtained from this market research is for Government planning purposes only, and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research, and the Government is not opening a question and answer period concerning this market research. Further, the Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information in response to this market survey.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing the requirements in the attached SOW, the Government requests that your capability statement address the following requests for information, if relevant.</p>
<p>1) Please provide the full company/entity name, address including points of contact (phone number and e-mail address), DUNS numbers, and type/size of the company/entity by NAICS code.</p>
<p>2) If your company/entity is a dealer or service-provider, and not a manufacturer of the end items/products contemplated by the SOW, please identify your company as such and identify the end item/product manufacturers that you would be obtaining goods from in order to perform the contract, and where the manufacturers are geographically located.</p>
<p>3) According to the small business limitations on subcontracting standard provided by the amended Small Business Act at 15 U.S.C. &sect; 657s, the requirement for a small business supplier is that the small business prime contractor "may not expend on subcontractors more than 50 percent of the amount, less the cost of materials, paid to the concern under the contract . . . ." 15 U.S.C. &sect; 657s(a)(2). However, "[c]ontract amounts expended by a covered small business concern on a subcontractor that is a similarly situated entity [(i.e., another small/small disadvantaged business of the same type)] shall not be considered subcontracted for purposes of determining whether the covered small business concern has violated [limitations on subcontracting.]" 15 U.S.C. &sect; 657s(b). If you are a small business, please address your ability to adhere to limitations on subcontracting at 15 U.S.C. &sect; 657s. To ascertain if you are a small business, use the size standard provided by NAICS Code 325412 (Pharmaceutical Preparation Manufacturing), with a size standard of no more than 750 employees.</p>
<p>As part of this, if you are a small business that is a dealer/service-provider and not a manufacturer, please so state, and address whether you meet the following requirements from 13 C.F.R. &sect; 121.406(b). Specifically, your company/entity:</p>
<p>(1) Does not exceed 500 employees (notice that the employee standard under the non-manufacturer rule is more restrictive than for NAICS Code 325412); <br /><br />(2) Is primarily engaged in the retail or wholesale trade and normally sells the type of item being supplied;<br /><br />(3) Takes ownership or possession of the item(s) with its personnel, equipment or facilities in a manner consistent with industry practice; and<br /><br />(4) Will supply the end item of a small business manufacturer, processor, or producer made in the United States.</p>
<p>NIH must receive written capability statements no later than <strong>December 9, 2015</strong> (CHANGED) at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. This date&nbsp;of closing of this&nbsp;Sources Sought notice is&nbsp;extended&nbsp;to&nbsp;December 9, 2015 from&nbsp;December 4, 2015.&nbsp; Please acknowledge this extension in you capabilities statments.&nbsp; E-mail the written capability statement to Lisa Schaupp, the Contract Specialist, at the e-mail address <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lisa.Schaupp@nih.gov</span>.</p>
<p>Respondents will NOT be notified as to the results of the Government's market research.<br /><br />The Date this Sources Sought Notice will close has been changed in this Modification.&nbsp; No other terms or conditions of the Sources Sought Notice or Statement of Work have been changed by this modification.</p>

<DESC>GUIS Opal Beach Parking Lot/Road Removal

SYNOPSIS: The Gulf Islands National Seashore (GUIS), a unit of the National Park Service (NPS), has a requirement for the removal of two remnant, abandoned parking lots and associated road segments at the South Opal Beach and North Opal Beach in Northwest Florida.  On or about November 16th the Government intends to issue an invitation to bid (IFB) for a single, firm-fixed price contract for dismantling, demolition, or removal of improvements.  This beach enhancement restoration project will restore the natural viewshed to improve visitors' experience.   

LOCATION: Opal Beach Area of Gulf Islands National Seashore is situated on Santa Rosa Island along J. Earle Bowden Way (State Road 399), which connects eastern Pensacola Beach to Navarre Beach, Florida.  The project area is bordered by sensitive habitat and two wetlands.

SUMMARY: The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and incidentals necessary to perform the excavation, loading and removal activities (to include hauling and dumping) a combined surface area of approximately 1.75 acres. All construction and demolition (C&D) debris shall be transported in a secure manner for off-site disposal or recycling.
  
C&D is defined in 62-701.200 (25) Florida Administrative Code 62-701.200 Definitions.
(25) "Construction and demolition debris" means discarded materials generally considered to be not water soluble and non-hazardous in nature, including but not limited to steel, glass, brick, concrete, asphalt material, pipe, gypsum wallboard, and lumber, from the construction or destruction of a structure as part of a construction or demolition project or from the renovation of a structure, including such debris from construction of structures at a site remote from the construction or demolition project site. The term includes rocks, soils, tree remains, trees, and other vegetative matter which normally results from land clearing or land development operations for a construction project; clean cardboard, paper, plastic, wood, and metal scraps from a construction project; effective January 1, 1997, except as provided in Section 403.707(13)(j), F.S., unpainted, non-treated wood scraps from facilities manufacturing materials used for construction of structures or their components and unpainted, non-treated wood pallets provided the wood scraps and pallets are separated from other solid waste where generated and the generator of such wood scraps or pallets implements reasonable practices of the generating industry to minimize the commingling of wood scraps or pallets with other solid waste; and de minimis amounts of other nonhazardous wastes that are generated at construction or demolition projects, provided such amounts are consistent with best management practices of the construction and demolition industries. Mixing of construction and demolition debris with other types of solid waste will cause it to be classified as other than construction and demolition debris.

Debris from a construction or demolition project that meets the current definition of C&D waste can be disposed in a C&D landfill or Material Recovery Facility.  The preferred option for managing any type of solid waste is to reuse or recycle the waste, whenever feasible.  Nonhazardous C&D debris is not federally regulated by EPA.  State and local regulations may limit where C&D debris can be disposed and may also require recycling a minimum percentage of the C&D debris generated. Visit www.cicacenter.org for more information.

DESCRIPTION: Work consists of the removal of debris in estimated quantities specified in the contract documents, which may include one or more of the following:

Workplan:
-	A 10-20-pp. Workplan prepared by the Contractor that briefly describes project schedule, roles and responsibilities, removal and disposal methodology, safety protocols, etc.

Opal Beach South Removal Areas
-	1,016 cubic yards (1 acre or 4,840 square yards x 0.21 yards) asphalt pavement and base materials
-	3,243 CY (1 acre or 4,840 square yards x 0.67 yards) subgrade fill sands (LCY estimate is 4,054)

<DESC>The United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA), Network Contracting Office (NCO) 17 located at 2002 Scott Boulevard, Temple, TX 76504-7451 is hereby publishing a notice of award to Valor Healthcare, Inc.  located at 500 W. Main Street, 19th Floor, Louisville, KY 40202, a large business under NAICS 621498 Size Standard $19 Million.  The North Texas Veterans Healthcare System, Sam Rayburn Memorial Veterans Center, Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) Program Office, 1201 East 9th Street, Bonham, TX 75418 has a CBOC in Sherman, TX that services 3,700 enrolled veteran beneficiaries within the Grayson County Texas catchment area.  CBOCS are established within geographical (usually by county) catchment areas that have an established veteran patient population outside of the greater metropolitan areas that larger VA Medical Centers are normally located.  The CBOC allows veterans greater access to care and take away the burden of traveling to larger cities, such as Dallas, TX (for the Sherman, TX CBOC patient population) often hours from their homes.  The CBOC also allows shorter waiting times and greater access to care.  The Sherman, TX CBOC is a Per Patient Member CBOC and is owned and operated by Valor Healthcare, Inc.  This three month continuation of services contract is required while a long term replacement contract is pursued through the acquisition lifecycle.  A J&A is attached in accordance with FAR Part 5.  The value of the firm fixed price contract is an estimated $586,524.00.  The current estimated patient population is 3,700 veteran beneficiaries. A request for proposal/request for quote will not be made available as this is a direct sole source award to Valor Healthcare, Inc.  In accordance with VHA policy, direct patient care cannot be disrupted at any time to veteran beneficiaries.  This award allows for non-interruption in the healthcare of veteran beneficiaries living within the Sherman, TX (Grayson County Texas) catchment area.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) anticipates awarding a modification to existing Labor Support contract SP3300-14-C-5002 on a sole source basis to Prolog, Inc requiring labor support to plan, program, manage, and execute efficient and effective receipt processing, storage and warehousing operations, material issue and transportation and shipping in support of Naval Sea Systems Command NAVSEA corporate shipyard customers (e.g., Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY) and Naval Station Norfolk (NSN)) for a one (1) month period (1 January 2016 -31 January 2016). FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services is included in the contract, and this modification is exercising the option as specified in that clause.
<p>Due to unanticipated acquisition process delays, it has become necessary to modify existing contract SP3300-14-C-5002 to allow for uninterrupted labor support services through January 31 2016. Pursuant to the exception under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), only Prolog, Inc is capable of providing the services at this time; award to any other source will result in unacceptable delays and cause a disruption to DLA Distribution Norfolk at Portsmouth, Virginia and DLA Maritime Norfolk activities. The modification to current contract SP3100-14-C-5002 will serve as a temporary solution to fulfill immediate mission requirements. <br /><br />Subject J&amp;A will be posted once subject modification is executed.<br />This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids. The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action.</p>
