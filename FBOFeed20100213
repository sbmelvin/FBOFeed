Each proposal was evaluated for technical acceptability based on the six technical subfactors included in the solicitation: Contract Management, Staffing, Quality Control, Commercial Reservation System, Reservation Tracking Program, and Customer Support. Then, each proposal was evaluated for price by combining the price per reservation for the base year and all option years. <br /><br />In response to this Solicitation, the lowest priced offer received was rated technically acceptable. Al Waseet Travel and Tourism Services received a technically acceptable rating during technical evaluations and submitted the lowest priced offer in response to this solicitation. Al Waseet Travel and Tourism Services offered a price of $2.95 USD per a reservation for the base year and $2.95 USD per reservation in each option year thereafter, evaluated at a total price of $14.75 USD.
