<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT Contracting Office:  Department of the Air Force, Headquarters Standard Systems Group (HQ SSG), Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex, Alabama Description:  This is not a Request for Proposal.  This is a notice of an Industry Day providing additional information on the requirement described below and a request for comments on the proposed acquisition strategy.  HQ SSG Information Logistics (IL) Systems Program Office is seeking qualified vendors capable of providing software products and configuration services to support the AF On-Line Vehicle Interactive Management System (OLVIMS). OLVIMS today consists of six legacy systems built on DOS based code working from stand-alone desk-top computers. The AF intends to procure software tools and integration services to provide the users of OLVIMS a new system which supports a new business process model for vehicle management within the DoD.  The AF will use General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules to procure the software and services required.  Following the OSD recommended approach; the acquisition strategy will focus on choosing the COTS product first.  An integration contractor will configure the selected COTS product to support the business practices of the Operational Architecture.  This acquisition process will allow the AF to focus on choosing a COTS product that best fits the business architecture designed for the future state or the “TO  BE” environment for vehicle management.  The COTS vendors will be asked to provide the service provider or recommend a service provider who has had significant and recent experience installing and configuring their product in environments of similar size and complexity where the product is being used for vehicle management.  Interested vendors will be asked initially to provide capability information on their products for evaluation.  This information will include, but is not limited to, past performance history, integrators of the products, copy of license agreements, etc.  Only a selected number of vendors will be asked to submit final proposals and demonstrate their products using the attached scenarios for vehicle management.  The products will not be judged solely on the capability to perform vehicle management.  Vehicle management is one logistics function within the broad logistics enterprise.  Products will be assessed on their ability to support vehicle management as well as other functional logistical businesses within the AF Logistics Enterprise. An award will be made to the vendor(s) who offers the best overall value to the Air Force customers.  An Industry Day is planned for September 4, 2003.  The location of the conference is 1931 Jefferson Davis Highway, Crystal City Building, Crystal Mall 3, Room C-43 (Concourse Level), Washington, D.C. from 1pm-5pm EST.  There will be limited seating; therefore, companies will be allowed to bring only 5 individuals (including their potential subcontractors).  To secure registration, attendees MUST provide the following information to Lt. Lillian Walton (lillian.walton@gunter.af.mil) by COB Friday, August 29, 2003: &#61485;	Company Name(s) &#61485;	Company Address(es) &#61485;	Company POC(s) -     The Individual’s Name(s), Telephone Number(s), and E-mail Address(es) Interested vendors are asked to review the attached draft documents and provide comments to the Program Office via e-mail on or before Monday, 8 September 2003.  No solicitation will be generated or contract awarded as a result of this request.  Additionally, the Air Force will not pay for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted in response to this request.  The Air Force will not hold meetings to discuss vendor comments. However, vendors may be contacted for clarification of comments.  For specific questions related to this effort, contact the Contracting Officer, Ms. Marie Walton at (334) 416-6268 or you may e-mail Ms. Walton at johnnie.walton@gunter.af.mil.

<DESC>Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Weapon System Lead System Integrator (AOC LSI) The AOC AN/USQ-163 Falconer, senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS), is the weapon system Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) for planning and executing theater-wide aerospace forces.  When the COMAFFOR is also the JFACC, the AOC is also the Joint Air Operations Center (JAOC).  In cases of Allied or Coalition (multinational) operations, the AOC is also a Combined Aerospace Operations Center (CAOC).  The AOC, manned by a dedicated cadre of trained professionals, enables the JFACC to exercise C2 of aerospace forces in support of the Joint Force Commander's (JFC) campaign plan.  The JFACC will employ the AOC to maneuver and mass overwhelming aerospace power through centralized control and decentralized execution to produce desired operational and strategic effects in support of the JFC's campaign. The AOC LSI contractor will provide systems engineering and integration for the AOC, supporting fielding, sustainment, training, and management and integration of the AOC Weapon System. This is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  More information regarding this acquisition is forthcoming.  Check this page often for information regarding Industry Day, draft RFP, and other related documentation.
