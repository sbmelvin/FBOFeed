<RESPDATE>050707
<ARCHDATE>06062007
<CONTACT>William Clausen Contract Specialist 402-346-8800 X4505
<DESC>DESCRIPTION: VA Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System, Omaha Division intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Integrated Voice Solutions, 1023 Mountain Creek Road, Suite A, Chattanooga, TN 37405 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-04. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition. This procurement is to obtain a leased voice system that will be used to record and hear messages all day long by successive shifts of nurses in accordance with required rules (i.e., JCAHO, HIPAA) that are automated so that nurses always can access patient information to which they have rights.  A reporting template shall include these reporting sections: Patient and safety alert - recorded when the patient is admitted and it includes the name of the patient, the 2nd patient identifier (required by JCAHO) and pertinent safety information.  This section can't be skipped ensuring that the nurse will be reminded each day about any safety precautions in place for the patient.  This alert may be appended as often as needed. Patient history - recorded when the patient is admitted.  The standard information to be included is defined on a hospital-created template given to nurses and it may differ somewhat from unit to unit.  This section can be skipped if a nurse has heard the history before.  The history may be appended as often as needed.  If there is new information in the history, an automated alert must sound to let a nurse know that the history must be heard anew. Shift report - shift reports are sorted by the day, evening and night report.  They are kept for 20 hours and then automatically roll off the system.  Support oncoming nurses - allowing them to hear report recorded by the immediate leaving nurse.  Allow rights to hear earlier shift reports on their patients, if needed.  Nurses select the particular report they wish (day, evening or night) and the system goes immediately to that report.  All shift reports are always preceded by the safety alert and the history (that can be skipped, if appropriate).  System should support an SBAR or other hospital-defined standardized report template, in addition to the default template. The system shall offer more than one way to access reports (for either recording or listening).  These will include the ability to pull up one report at a time, a way to listen in sequence and a way to listen to all of the reports (including non-shift types of reports) on a particular patient. The system shall allow individual reports to be created that then have their own individual addenda added. The system shall include a standard charge nurse report format that also can be used for other purposes (i.e., group reports by student nurses, techs, aids, etc.). The system shall allow the hospital to set different rules for different types of staff in terms of which reports they may access for recording and/or listening.  For instance, the system could be set up to allow a case manager to both add to (record) and hear a nurse patient report.  It also should be set up to allow, for instance, an RT only to add to the nurse patient report, but not hear it.  Many ancillary departments, treatment procedure areas and outpatient clinics use the system for a variety of purposes, including informing the nurse on the floor about a patient. The system shall allow shift reports to be transferred when a patient moves from one area to another; this is important for HIPAA purposes and allows the system to automatically discontinue the rights of one group of nurses (the transferring unit) to a particular report while making it possible for the next group of nurses (the unit receiving the report) to access the report. The system shall allow transfer reports to be created for movement of patients from areas like the ED, PACU and ICU to the floor.  A transfer report is not the same as a shift report and serves an entirely different purpose.  When a transfer report is used, there is an automatic notification to the receiving unit that a report is ready and a patient is ready to be moved.  There also is an automatic verification message to the sending unit when the report has been heard. The systems shall produce standard reports (shift report, transfer report, charge nurse report, ancillary report) that stay in the system for a prescribed period of time and then are automatically deleted. The system should allow the addition of other modules such as: physician reporting, a Family Line, Discharge Care Reminder, MD Consult, etc  Technical Requirements System should run in currently supported Windows environment (Windows Server 2003 preferred) System must interface with Nortel Meridian Switch T1 Type connection to Nortel Switch Maintenance interface shall be via VA VPN Contractor shall comply with VA rules for information security and system reliability Tasking The contractor shall provide comprehensive support in the delivery of products and materials associated with this request.  In satisfying this request the deliverables include documentation and physical deployment of devices. Contractor shall provide systems maintenance support to include: Access to a toll-free, 24/7 Help Desk.   Page answered within 15 minutes.   Help Desk answered immediately.   Software release/system upgrades at no additional cost.   Hardware support - depot service, provide systems replacement as necessary. For voice board, modem or other peripheral hardware components, replacements provided to Client (Client supplies labor).  For server failures, vendor provides full replacement hardware or manufacturer technician to resolve server issues Backup of all files. Quarterly database backup. Sys Admin Assistance with updating user and patient tables  Support for escalation procedure for handling system technical problems.   Training and consulting services  Help materials (handbooks, workbooks, videos, training unit packets) Government responsibility The VA will provide information as necessary to support what needs to be installed and where. VA will provide access to systems and physical locations THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. All proposals received by 4:00 P.M. Pacific Time, January 26, 2007, will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by mail, email or by facsimile at (402) 449-0612.  Email address to william.clausen@va.gov.
