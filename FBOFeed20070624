<DESC>One set of questions was received by the June 21st date given by previous announcement.  The answers have been posted as amendment 1 to the solicitation.  

The Department of State (DOS) has a current requirement for telecommunications cable system design, installation and testing services. We anticipate awarding four  IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) contracts .  Each contract will have a 12-month base year plus four 12-month Options. The contract ceiling is $2M per contract over 5 years.  Estimated  performance start date is June 2007.

The delivery orders will usually be for testing installed telecommunications cables systems at US Embassies and other diplomatic posts around the world but may require design and installation of systems at overseas posts on an infrequent basis.  The offer must be able to provide a Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) Archetect, A RCDD engineer and experienced Senior and Junior technicians.

This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541380 and the small business size standard is $11M.

In order to be considered for award of this contract, interested offerors, including all entities which comprise a joint venture, and the joint venture itself, must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Final Secret, Interim Top Secret or Final Top Secret facility clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. At least two contracts will be awarded to firms currently possessing Interim or Final Top Secret FCLs, while firms with Final Secret FCLs may be selected for one or more additional awards.  Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.
Selected firms possessing a Final Secret FCL will be sponsored by Department of State for an FCL upgrade to the Top Secret level. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the upgraded clearance. A period of 90 days from the date of selection for award will be allowed for the Secret cleared firm to obtain an Interim Top Secret FCL.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider not awarding the contract to the selected offeror.
Due to time constraints, the Government will not delay award of contracts to selected firms already in possession of Interim and Final Top Secret FCLs.  Contractor personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must possess Secret or Top Secret personnel security clearances issued by DSS prior to performance on the contract.

<SUBJECT>D -- NCES
<DESC>On March 10, 2006, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) conducted a Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Industry Day, one element of which dealt with Content Discovery & Delivery (CD&D).  As the follow-on to the Industry Day a subsequent Market Research Questionnaire was completed by participating industry partners.  DISA continued market research with industry by conducting one-on-one meetings with potential industry partners who were interested in providing CD&D and other capabilities. Concurrent with the NCES acquisition strategy, DISA also conducted an assessment of existing programs which could be adopted as a government managed service provider for CD&D. As a result of market research and the existing program assessments, DISA established memoranda of agreement with two existing government programs to adopt their existing services, supporting infrastructure, and sustaining activities including help desk and technical support. Specifically, the Director of National Intelligence, Intelligence Community Enterprise Solutions at Ft Meade, MD was adopted to deliver the Content Discovery capability, and the DISA Computing Services Directorate at Falls Church, VA was adopted as the government managed service provider for the GIG Content Delivery Service. Questions should be directed to Ms. Ginny Parsons, NCES PMO, email ginny.parsons@disa.mil.
