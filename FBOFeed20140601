<p>The Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) exists to plan and conduct pre-clinical and clinical research on the biologic and therapeutic effects of radiation administrated alone or in combination with other modalities of treatment; to develop novel technology and imaging based approaches for radiation oncology; to investigate the natural history of disease to understand and evaluate means of diagnostic assessment for the purpose of optimizing treatment selections; and to provide radiation therapy as well as general oncology consultations for patients admitted to other Clinical Research Center (CRC) clinical services, in a collaborative approach.</p>
<p>Recently, NCI 's ROB has decided to revisit prostate implants utilizing a 3-dimensional ultrasound imaging <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>technique.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The importance of this technique is that it incorporated the existing Government owned equipment and simply involves incorporating attachments to produce a real-time 3-dimensional of a patient's anatomy in the prostate region.</p>
<p>The Oncentra Prostate package from Elekta Inc. includes a new stepper adapter and probe cradle which fits the existing stepper and probe, yet is compatible with the new EndoCavity Rotational Mover (ECRM).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The computer controlled ECRM is used to reliably and accurately rotate the ultrasound probe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A Stepper Encoder provides rotational coordinate information for each sagittal probe image which is used to generate a 3-dimentikonal image of the local autonomy. In addition, Oncentra Prostate treatment planning software incorporates the 3D ultrasound volume, allows for the fusion of it to a CT or MR image set and for the user to determine the optimum implant geometry in real-time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Treatment planning (including <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>inverse <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>planning), optimization and implant evaluation can be performed quickly, saving time for the overall procedure.</p>
<p>The <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>acquisition is for the Oncentra Prostate package of hardware and software that will extend the capabilities of the existing, Government owned Nucletron Prostate Stepper and template and the B-K Pro Focus-G ultrasound unit with attached MFI Trans-Rectal Bi-Plane Transducer array to provide a real-time, 3D ultrasound image permitting the visualization of each needle path as it is inserted and providing subsequent needle<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>trajectories consistent with an optimal implant array, generating treatment plan dose distributions, dose optimization and implant evaluation and transferring the resulting catheter dwell positions via network to the existing Nucletron Treatment Control System (TCS) so that the treatment can be accurately delivered by the existing Nucletron MicroSelectron v.3 high dose-rate (HDR) remote after loading<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>unit.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">A sole source is intended for this order, based on the fact that </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Elekta Incorporated acquired Nucletron in 2011 and continues to solely market and support Nucletron's<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>brachytherapy<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>products.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Elekta has developed the adapters, controllers and interfaces to enable the B-K trans-rectal transducer array to collect 3-dimensional sectored data and reconstruct them into a volumetric image for image guided needle placement, treatment planning and transfer of treatment critical information to the treatment delivery system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information - Macrofoam Swabs 
<SOLNBR>RFI06012014
<RESPDATE>063014
<CONTACT>Lynda M. Theisen, Fax 703-632-8480, Email Lynda.Theisen@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research for information and planning purposes to determine the existing market capability of businesses to supply two different macrofoam swabs that can be moistened at time of use. The Government intends to review all responses. With this notice, the FBI wants to obtain market information for planning purposes. All interested, capable, and responsible businesses are encouraged to submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />The Scientific Response Unit (SRU) of the FBI Laboratory is responsible for collecting hazardous evidence at crime scenes where Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) might be present. Swabs are among a variety of tools used by SRU for collection of biological agents from environmental surfaces. <br />The description below outlines requirements of two new collection devices that will be needed in order to process biological evidence. Respondents should identify their capabilities that would help fulfill the currently envisioned collection device. The information gathered, if deemed successful, will be used to formulate final requirements, which may subsequently be posted in a solicitation for competitive bids.<br /><br /><strong>Background</strong><br />The SRU currently utilizes macrofoam swabs with a shelf life that is limited because of the evaporation of moistening buffer from the swab head over time. Within the shelf life of the swab evaporation may create inconsistencies in water content as well as variation in buffer salt and surfactant concentrations. The SRU requires extended shelf life swabs that are consistently and appropriately moist at the point of use. <br /><br /><strong>Requirements<br /></strong>The Government requests that the contractor or contractors provide the following:<br /><br />1: Overall configuration: The sampling device will consist of a swab of absorbent material affixed to the end of a semi-rigid shaft with a handle at the opposite end. The swab will be housed until use in an impact-resistant screw-cap tube of appropriate dimensions. The swab shaft shall be fixed to the screw cap closure of the tube and serve duel functions of sealing the tube and acting as the handle of the swab shaft. The screw cap should tightly seal the tube to permit resealing after use and facilitate safe transport. The device will also have a means to moisten the swab head at the point-of-use and to express excess fluid from the swab head (if required).<br /><br />2: Head shapes: A: Paddle-type head with two distinguishable sides. Paddle may be rectangular or round. B: Standard swab type head.<br /><br />3: Head material: Macrofoam or other suitable material. Must conform to surface contours during use and rebound to original shape after use. Must efficiently absorb and release analytes consisting of soluble proteins and particulate materials including microorganisms. Supplier must provide data demonstrating the adsorption and release characteristics of the material with analytes of different types.<br /><br />4: Shaft: The swab shaft must be firm but flexible. The shaft must be flexible to the extent that the swab head will lie flush against the sampled surface when force is applied while the shaft handle is held at a 20 to 30 degree angle to the surface. The shaft must also be stiff enough so that pressure at the swab head during use is a function of the force applied by the user and not limited by the elasticity of the shaft (assuming the applied force is reasonable for the activity).<br /><br />5: Moistening system: The device must have a means to moisten the swab head at the point-of-use with minimal risk of unintentionally contaminating the swab. The moistened swab head should not contain excess fluid. Proper liquid content in the swab head may be achieved either by controlling the wetting process or by removing excess fluid after wetting. There is no firm requirement regarding the mechanics of the moistening system so long as ease of use and aseptic technique are maintained. A variety of moistening solutions may be required, the most common of which will be composed of phosphate buffer or phosphate buffered saline containing a surfactant (e.g., Tween-20, Triton X-100, etc.). A neutralizing agent may be required in the buffer for some applications. <br /><br />6: Swab housing tube: The tube that houses the swab should accommodate a tight sealing screw cap closure. The tube composition should be able to resist compromise under abuse conditions that could occur during use and transport (shock, vibration, temperature, etc.). The tube configuration should accommodate sample extraction and some processing directly in the tube. <br /><br />7: Screw cap and shaft assembly: The shaft of the swab should be affixed to the screw cap such that the cap may be used as a handle during swab use. Ideally, the swab shaft should he held firmly but be removable if desired. <br /><br />8: Tamper indicator: Either the swab/tube assembly itself or its packaging should posses a mechanism to indicate whether the swab has not been tampered with or otherwise compromised prior to use.<br /><br />9: Labeling: The swab housing tube should contain a method for identifying and tracking the device after use. This may be attained by indelible labeling at the point-of-use or by means of serial numbers and/or bar codes. The housing tube must contain a surface that can accommodate user initials and date of use.<br /><br />10. Sizes: There is a need for several sizes. At minimum two swab devices are required that either incorporate or can be accommodated in standard sized 15- and 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes.<br /><br />11: Assay compatibility: The composition of the swab head, shaft, housing tube, and any adhesives that might come in contact with extraction fluids must not release any substance that will interfere with subsequent chemical or microbiological analysis.<br /><br />12: Quality control/Quality assurance: The sampling devices must be manufactured with a documented ISO or GMP process. The devices should be certified sterile and within agreed-up limits of DNA/RNA content. Each shipment should contain certification documentation and clear lot number markings.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span></strong>: This RFI is only soliciting information on the availability of a swab that incorporates the use of a macrofoam or other suitable material with the ability to be moistened just prior to use. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted by email to the Contracting Officer at <a href="mailto:Lynda.Theisen@ic.fbi.gov">Lynda.Theisen@ic.fbi.gov</a>. <br /></span></strong><br /><strong>THIS NOTICE IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY</strong>, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposal, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotation, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement.
