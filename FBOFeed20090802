**CHANGE IN SET ASIDE FROM "FULL AND OPEN" TO "TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS"

The original posting of this combined synopsis/solicitation was posted - in error - as a full and open procurement.  This amendment to the solicitation corrects the procurement method and changes it from "full and open" to "total small business" set aside.  The NAICS code and small business size standards set in the attached solicitation are correct.

This amendment to the solicitation corrects the procurement method and changes it from "full and open" to "total small business" set aside.  The NAICS code and small business size standards set in the attached solicitation are correct.
