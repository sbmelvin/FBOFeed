<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for  1 each Form TalySurf Plus Measuring Machine (or equivalent).  Minimum Requirements For Stylus Profilometer for Surface Texture and Contour Measurement  General: The instrument must be able to measure the surface texture and contour of machined parts ranging from rocket engine tribological components to optical surfaces.  Common rocket engine components include highly polished ceramic ball bearings, precision ground steel bearing rings, lapped gears, shot-peened turbine blades, injector nozzles, and high pressure mechanical seals.  Optical surfaces include polished quartz flats, replicated grazing incidence X-ray optics, and super polished conical mandrels.  The components being measured will include interior and exterior surfaces.  The instrument must be able to measure three dimensional surface profile in addition to more common two dimensional surface profile.  The ability to measure a wide range of contour while still being able resolve fine roughness detail is essential.   This procurement will replace an existing stylus tracing type instrument, a Taylor-Hobson Form Talysurf 120L, circa 1990, with 3-D option (also known as an automatic Y-axis table).	The existing instrument no longer meets our technical requirements in the following areas: vertical resolution, vertical range, horizontal straightness, traversing length, automatic Y-axis table travel, automatic Y-axis load capacity, slow computing speed and limited DOS based computer control, data acquisition, analysis and reporting.  The new instrument will be a turn key system and all accessories must be compatible with the basic instrument.   For help in evaluating candidate instruments and their existing specifications, the following conventions are typically followed for describing such a profile tracing instrument:  the tracing direction as the X-axis; the movement of the work piece table to reposition the part for a parallel trace as the Y-axis; and the vertical motion of the stylus as the Z-axis.   Gage requirements: Vertical range and resolution, roughness:  10 millimeters @ 1 nanometer Vertical range and resolution, contour:  30 millimeters @ 3 nanometer Horizontal straightness:  100 nanometers per 100 millimeters travel Traversing Length: 200 millimeters Calibration:	arcuate method using ball or hemisphere.  Ball or hemisphere must be traceable to a national standard. Work Piece Capacities: Automatic Y-axis table:  100 millimeter travel, 1 micrometer steps, 20 kg load capacity Without automatic or manual Y-axis table:   100 kg weight, 500 mm height Computer and Operating System Software: PC compatible computer control and data analysis with Windows based software. Provide for the exporting of profile data sets for use in external plotting programs or spreadsheet software.   Provide paper copy of profile trace Provide means of exporting modified profile plot to Windows word processing or desktop publishing programs for report writing. Allow for multitasking such that the instrument can be making a 3-D measurement in the background, while a previously made measurement can be analysed in the foreground.	 Surface Texture and Contour Analysis Software The software shall calculate two dimensional surface texture parameters that conform to recognized standards such as ANSI/ASME B46.1 and ISO 4287.  Similar three-dimensional (3-D) parameters should also be included, however, since no standard for 3-D parameters exists such as for 2-D, the software should describe how the 3-D parameters are calculated.     The surface texture analysis software shall include: Form removal to remove curvature and tilt from the profile Ability to exclude regions from form removal calculation Cut-off filtering to distinguish waviness from roughness Amplitude, spacing, and hybrid parameters for roughness and waviness The contour analysis software shall provide for calculation of basic dimensional analysis of radius, angle, length, and height.    Accessories Vee block pair: for supporting long cylindrical parts Manual Y axis table: for small displacement, manual positioning of samples Reference measurement standards with certificates of calibration to include:   ball, for arcuate calibration angle prism, for precise angle calibration step height Additional Stylii:   for small bores (&lt;2 mm)  for deep recess (&lt;25 mm) Stylus stop attachment to prevent stylus from dropping into recesses This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The BDS Systems are comprised of the Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Biological Integrated Detection System (M31 BIDS), the Pre-Planned Product Improved (P3I) Biological Integrated Detection System (M31A1 BIDS), the Joint Biological Point Dete ction System (M31A2 JBPDS), the Long Range Biological Standoff Detection System (XM94 LR-BSDS), the East Coast Excursion (ECE JBPDS XM97), the Joint Biological Standoff Detection System (JBSDS), the Joint Service Installation Pilot Project (JSIPP, XM97 JBP DS), and the Portal Shield Detection System.  Contractors are responsible for providing all CLS services, to include logistic integration services, direct support and general support maintenance and/or operator functions, materials, equipment, supplies, pa rts, management, training, technical assistance, and qualified personnel, in accordance with a Performance Work Statement, for the above systems to fielded units of all the military services and other government agencies, located either CONUS or OCONUS.  N umber of systems fielded or planned to be fielded are: M31 BIDS_41 ea; M31A1 BIDS_83 ea; M31A2 JBPDS_ 2,134 ea combined total for all services; LR-BSDS_3 ea; ECE JBPDS_13 ea; JBSDS_24 ea; JSIPP_5 ea; and Portal Shield_approx 290.  The quantities of each sy stem are estimates only and are subject to change.  The government intends to consolidate the above requirements into one bundle under one solicitation with the intent of awarding to one prime contractor.  The solicitation will be issued under Full & Open Competition and will result in a long term, 10 year, IDIQ type contract that may include options.  A Best Value/Tradeoff Analysis approach will be utilized where proposals are evaluated against, in addition to cost or price, selection criteria such as mana gement, logistics  capability, small business participation, and past performance, that results in the best value to the government.  The actual nonprice evaluation factors will be contained in the formal solicitation.  The NAICS code that applies to this procurement is 811219.  The size standard for this NAICS code is $6M in annual revenues.  Companies exceeding this size standard will be considered as large businesses.  A draft solicitation with a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) will be issued appr oximately 15 Oct 03 where comments from Industry are invited.  The draft solicitation and draft PWS will be made available on TACOM RIs PROCNET website.  A PreProposal Conference will be held at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Edgewood, MD in late October 2003 to  discuss the acquisition and address Industry concerns.  Any firms interested in attending the PreProposal Conference hould notify the POC below by email or FAX NLT 15 Oct 03, where additional information will be provided.  Due to limited space, it is anti cipated that only 2 or 3 persons per firm may attend.  A final solicitation will be issued approximately 8 Dec 03.  This notice satisfies the requirement at FAR 10.001 where any affected incumbent small business concerns must be notified of the governments  intention to bundle requirements. Note 9 applies.  Any questions or comments may be addressed to the POC, Mr. Dick Permantier, FAX (309) 782-3161, email permantierr@ria.army.mil.

The open market items are listed in the attached document and interested parties shall provide pricing for those items and include the information requested below in their submission.  THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS, AND IS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 – STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS – AS SUPPLEMENT WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICTATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.  The solicitation number is NESDIS100 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The Government is not liable for optional items or option years unless they are unilaterally exercised through the issuance of a modification against this order.  The period of performance shall be for a base year of twelve months starting from the contract award date and includes four option years of twelve months each.  Interested parties must provide information that specifies their ability to deliver items as necessary to a number of locations including Darmstadt, Germany.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, New Iberia Research Center (NIRC), 4401 W. Admiral Doyle Drive, New Iberia, Louisiana, under existing contract N01-NS-9-2302, for an additional 105,000 hours of labor effort to the current contract term, October 30, 1998 through October 31, 2003.  The contract is entitled Study of Slow, Latent and Temperate Virus Infections of the Nervous System caused by Conventional and Unconventional Viruses; and, Maintenance of a Breeding Colony of Rhesus Monkeys for Intramural Research. The current contract requires support for the work needed for the veterinary care, technical support care, treatment and housing of a research animal colony of approximately 73 nonhuman primates involved in the study of slow, latent and temperate infections of the nervous system caused by conventional and unconventional viruses.  Included in the nonhuman primates are 65 chimpanzees, 1 gibbon, and 7 New World monkeys.   In addition, the contract requires support for the work needed for the animal housing, veterinary care, management and maintenance of the NINDS specific pathogen free rhesus macaque breeding colony. The present population of the rhesus monkey breeding colony is approximately 128 monkeys.  This new work will require NIRC to continue performing all of the aforementioned tasks.  NIRC provides on-site veterinary care, extensive knowledge of and experience with infectious diseases, and is well versed in the prescribed guidelines on the use and care of laboratory animals.  In addition, NIRC provides AAALAC accredited state-of-the-art facilities, which includes indoor and outdoor caging for the animals noted above.  The research animal colonies at NIRC are housed separately by species, and supporting clinical examining and treatment rooms, and surgical rooms are adjacent to the housing areas, all of which are AAALAC accredited. A determination for use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  NIRC has been determined to be the only responsible source because of the staff’s familiarity with the various NINDS on-going studies supported by the NIRC.  To move the animals to a new location would be very disruptive to them, since a number of them have been at NIRC for over twenty years.  In addition, relocation may jeopardize the research activities, and it would be very expensive to the NINDS to move the animals to a new facility.  NIRC has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise to continue the contract work based on their experience to date under the contract.  Inherent duplication of the cost to the Government and unacceptable performance delays make competition for the additional labor effort unfeasible.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends this contract to provide targeted screening to identify potential therapeutic and preventive modalities, as well as resources to characterize additional antimicrobial activities of already licensed antimicrobial agents, small animal and non-human primate models to test the safety and efficacy of therapeutic and preventive modalities that target emerging infectious agents including, Bioterrorism Category A-C agents as outlined in the CDC website http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/Agentlist.asp.  A list of priority organisms is also available on the NIAID website http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm.

The objective of this contract is to provide a range of developmental resources to bring new therapies and preventive measures from the laboratory to initial clinical testing in humans.  The contract consists of six parts, listed below, which each contribute to the overall development effort.  These contracts will provide a ready capacity in a number of needed areas and will be utilized as products become available for testing.  Test articles that are found to have activity in Part A may progress through development using contractors from other parts.  For Parts C, D, E and F, various vaccine concepts may be tested based on the following categories:   (a) synthetic peptides, (b) recombinant subunits, (c) vector based vaccines, (d) virus-like particles/replicons, or (e) nucleic acid based vaccines. The contract will have six (6) parts.

Part A: In Vitro Screens for Antimicrobial Activity.  Part A will provide the capacity to screen test articles for antimicrobial activity against emerging infectious agents including, Bioterrorism Category A-C agents.  Materials for testing will be obtained by NIAID and provided to the contractor for testing.  This contract is not intended to cover antiviral screening against viral hemorrhagic fevers or poxviruses, which is covered by a separate contract.  

Part B: Clinical Isolate Panels for Selected Bacterial Pathogens.  Part B will provide the capacity to perform antimicrobial activity determination against clinical panels of bacterial pathogens to arrive at tentative susceptibility breakpoints. This activity is to be performed using bacterial pathogens classified as emerging infectious agents, including Bioterrorism Category A-C agents.  Antimicrobial agents to be tested under this contract will be selected on the basis of their activity against select genera and species of bacterial pathogens using reference strains. 

Part C: Small Animal Models for Selected Pathogens, including GLP Studies.  Part C will support the development, validation and use of various small animal models to screen new therapeutic, diagnostic and preventive agents or test the efficacy of therapeutics, immunotherapies, diagnostics, and vaccines with activity against emerging infectious agents including, Bioterrorism Category A-C agents.  

Part D:  Non-human Primate Models for Selected Pathogens, including GLP Studies.  Part D will support the development, validation and use of various non-human primate models to screen new therapeutic, diagnostic and preventive agents or test the efficacy of therapeutics, immunotherapies, diagnostics, and vaccines with activity against emerging infectious agents including, Bioterrorism Category A-C agents.  

Part E:  Safety and Immunogenicity Testing for Vaccines.  Part E will support the testing of vaccine preparations as required prior to initial clinical evaluation (under GLP).  This includes testing candidate products for safety and immunogenicity (both cellular and humoral) in small animals and, if appropriate, in non-human primates.

Part F: Safety/Toxicology and Pharmacology Testing for Therapeutics.  Part F will support the testing of candidate products for safety, including reproductive toxicology and other appropriate tests, in small and large animal, and if necessary, in non-human primates.  This activity includes all such tests as are required to support clinical use in humans; testing must be sufficient to meet requirements for IND filing (GLP).
 

It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made for each part of this Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) solicitation.  The ordering period of this IDIQ will be in effect for seven (7) years.  An IDIQ contract provides for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services to be furnished during a fixed period, with deliveries or performance to be scheduled by the Government placing orders with the contractor.  Task orders will be issued to the pre-qualified pool of contractors for parts A, B, C, D, E or F based on the specific requirements of the task order. The RFP contains at least one actual task for each of these six parts. In response to this RFP, potential Offerors may submit proposals for one or more of the six Parts described above.  For Parts A and B, Offerors should propose as many organisms or groups of organisms as possible.  Within Parts C, and D Offerors may submit proposals for one or more of the models using the same organisms/disease or models for more than one organism/disease. Offerors for Parts E and F should propose a comprehensive services to cover all aspects of the Statement of Work.  Proposals will undergo peer review based on the evaluation criteria and awards will be made to the most qualified proposals.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification #2 is to make changes and additions in the specifications, to change the shipping requirements, to extend the deadline for submission of offers, and to respond to Questions.   
1.  The Specification for the Automated Microplate Washer is changed.  The requirement for 16 channels is deleted.    
2. Offers shall provide price for shipping equipment to USAID/CDC,  American Embassy, Almaty, Kazakhstan (16 sets), and USAID/CDC, American Embassy, Tashkent, Uzbekistan (19 sets), quoted both for shipment via air freight, and via surface. Delivery is due within 90 days from the effective date of award.  The equipment shall be consigned to the USAID/CDC, US Embassies in these countries. 
3.  Offers are due at 10 AM, Almaty time on October 6, 2003. 
4.  Questions and Answers: 
Question 1: The specification for the microplate washer calls for 8, 12 and 16 channel manifolds.  Does this mean that you would like an 8, 12, and 16 channel manifolds (all 3)  included with the proposal?  Or simply that the washer should have the capability of using these 3 types of manifolds?   
Answer: The washer must be compatible with both 8 and 12 channel manifolds, and must include both. (16 channel capacity is not needed).
Question 2:  Under the pipette tip section, there is no mention of whether the tips are to be bulk (in a bag), box racked,  box rack sterile or rack packs.  What racking configuration is required? Box Racked 200ul and P2/P10 style tips come 960/unit traditionally to accommodate microtitre spacing, not 1000 per unit as is mentioned in the specification.  1000ul tips do come 1000 per unit in both bulk and box racks.  It would be very inconvenient to use the multichannel pipettors mentioned in the solicitation with bagged bulk pipette tips.
Answer: The tips should be bulk, and hence will be nonsterile (we had specified STERILE in the posting). While we realize that it may be less convenient to use the multichannel pipettors mentioned in the solicitation with bulk pipette tips, given the cost difference, the inconvenience is far outweighed by the cost savings.
 
Question 3.  In the RFP it mentions the option of a two step water system with RO or distillation on the front end and a cartridge based polishing system on the back end.  Can you please clarify this?  Is a two step system required (RO or distillation on the front end) or if another configuration will satisfy the requirements, would it be acceptable?  Since it mentions the option of a two step system, would it be possible to offer two choices in water systems? One a classic two step and perhaps a second alternative, without being judged as not having properly responded to the solicitation? 
Answer: The two-step water purification process in the subject RFP was an example of one possible configuration.  The water purification system proposed by the offeror must be capable of producing analytical grade ultrapure water, as stated in solicitation document.  Offerors may propose alternative water purification systems, bearing in mind that price is the most important selection factor.  
 
Question 4.  For the Cryovials mentioned in the RFP, is a silicone seal required?
Answer: A silicone seal is NOT required for the cryovials.
 
Question 5:  Do the displays and printouts from the instruments have to be in Russian or is the requirement that just the manuals be in Russian. 
Answer: The displays and printouts do NOT need to be in Russian, as long as the Russian-language manuals show the English words which would be in displays, and explains the meaning in Russian.  For example, if the display reads Error 6A, the manual should explain the meaning of Error 6A in Russian.  
 
Question 6: What is the speed range for the shaker/rotator in RPM?
Answer: Orbital, variable speed, 100-1500 RPM.  
 
Question 7: Please advise what material the cylinders are to be made from - glass, plastic (what type, ie PMP, PP, PE, etc) and the error limits, graduation marks?
Answer:   (1) Cylinders; Polypropylene or Polymethylpentene; Graduated with 1.0 mL subdivisions; Error limit: < or = 1.0 mL.  (2) Cylinders, 1000 ml; Polypropylene or Polymethylpentene; Graduated with 10.0 mL subdivisions; Error limit: < or = 6.0 mL

Question 8: Please provide the specifications on the centrifuge tubes - conical, constructed of what material, graduated, sterile/nonsterile, etc? 
Answer:   Conical leakproof polypropylene or polystyrene tubes, 15mL, clear or translucent, with polypropylene, polystyrene or polyethylene plug seal cap, nonsterile, graduation marks not necessary
 
Question 9: Specifications for the item listed as CENTRIFUGES. At a minimum, we would need- RPM speed, fixed or variable speed, rotor type, number of places and number of tubes, size of tubes to be spun, timer and range, any other requirements.   
Answer:  Centrifuge for Serum Separation, Speed range: 0-3200 rpm or greater; Maximum Relative Centrifugal Force: 1,212 x g or greater; Timer: at least 30 min in 5 min increments; Tubes accepted: 2-15 mL (or broader; tube holder adjusters must be supplied); Rotor: angled
  
Question 10:  Can you please indicate where we may find 22CFR228.51?  Could you advise where we may find an explanation of the meaning of the following paragraph; or, could you offer an explanation, please?  Origin (country of manufacture) of each product.   The Authorized Geographic Codes for this contract are 000 (United States) and 110 (independent countries of the former Soviet Union).   If a 000 or 110-origin product is not available, the offeror must provide an explanation and request a waiver in accordance with 22CFR228.51.  The origin of the products we could offer differ from the codes 000 or 110. Could we still proceed with our products? 
Answer: 22CFR 228.51 may be found at the following link: http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_01/22cfr228_01.html
It is a Federal Regulation that specifies administrative practice and procedures regarding Source, Origin and Nationality of USAID-financed commodities and services.  For this solicitation, products manufactured in and shipped from countries in Geographic Codes 000 and 110 are being sought.  However, if one of the required products is not manufactured in any of the authorized countries, then the offeror may propose a product manufactured elsewhere, with an explanation and request for a waiver of the geographic restriction.  There is no prescribed format or form for a waiver request. For example, if there is no company in the United States or the independent countries of the former Soviet Union that manufactures an incubator that meets the solicitation’s specifications, then an offeror may propose a product manufactured elsewhere.  Geographic code 000 is defined as USA. Geographic Code 110 is defined as New Independent States - Collective for New Independent States of the former Soviet Union.
 
Question 11. NAICS code is 541990. Does it mean that the company whose business status is not applicable to this code could not send their offers? 
Answer:  The code is intended to describe the product or service, not the seller.    
 
Question 12: For some of the countries in question, standard freight delivery services will not deliver palletized goods to the US embassy. Since the bid calls for a delivery cost to the US embassy in each of the countries mentioned, is one able to quote the delivery cost to the airport only, if obvious carriers such as Federal Express will not deliver palletized goods directly to the embassy? 
Answer: 16 sets of equipment must be consigned to USAID/CDC,  American Embassy, Almaty, Kazakhstan.  19 sets of equipment must be consigned to USAID/CDC,  American Embassy, Tashkent, Uzbekistan.  Freight costs should include the cost of local delivery from the port of entry to a warehouse, exact location TBD, within Almaty and Tashkent.  USAID will arrange for duty and tax-free customs clearance at ports of entry.  
 
Question 13: Is used equipment acceptable? 
Answer: No.

1. Overview: AF 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, chapter 2, allows weapons simulators to be used to qualify personnel with weapons. Weapons simulators are needed at all Air Combat Command (ACC) bases to provide continuing weapons qualification training when small arms ranges are closed for repair, ammunition is unavailable, or for northern tier bases when weather prohibits their use. During FY03 and FY04, 14 bases within ACC will be closing their ranges for major renovations. These renovations will last from weeks to months, according to the level of work being performed. Considering ACC Combat Arms sections annually provide weapons qualification training to over 75K people, the loss of even a few days of training time can directly effect ours Wing’s arming ability. Weapons simulators can also be used to provide unique training opportunities for specific missions. Units can use the systems to conduct judgmental training by the use of shoot-don't shoot scenarios or, by the use of authoring stations, they can create localized training scenarios to provide realistic training. AFI 36-2226 mandates simulator weapons must perform in all respects like actual weapons. To meet the need of the command and AFI 36-2226 requirements, the following requirements were developed: 

2. Weapons requirements to be included in the price of the system: 2.1. System must have 10 M16A2 rifles, 10 M9 pistols, and 10 M4 carbines with flat top universal rails.  2.2. Weapons must be capable of using owner installed optics, laser and inferred pointers as they were designed without interfering with system operations or affecting warranties. 2.3. Weapons and systems used to control weapons, must use accurate and validated ballistics for each type of weapon. Ballistic data must have been previously validated by another federal agency.  The integration of another companies validated ballistic data into the training system will satisfy the Air Force’s validation requirement’s under this section. VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:  There must be a high degree of variation in ballistic effects for different types/sizes of ammunition.  While some ammunition may have a relatively flat trajectory over typical shooting distances, others may have a pronounced arc, forcing the shooter to learn to compensate.  The most obvious example of this is the fact that a pistol does not shoot like a rifle.   A more subtle example involves the way some ammunition drifts during its flyout.  This drift causes the projectile to move left or right based on the direction of its spin.  When firing a weapon such as the 40mm MK19, this drift must be modeled, if the shooter is to be expected to ever fire the real weapon accurately.  In addition a high-fidelity simulator must teach the shooter to compensate for the effects of wind.  This windage effect is not only a matter of wind speed and direction, but also of firing distance.  In order to correctly calculate this effect, ballistics must be factored in.  Another function of ballistics is to terminate the flight of the projectile at the proper distance.  In the absence of correct ballistics, the projectile will fly to the incorrect distance or virtually forever.  Each of these computations allows for the proper adjustment to the flight path of that round, given the amount of time, distance, and wind that has elapsed since the round left the weapon.  The system uses that information, along with a highly precise laser detection system to provide characteristics matching that of real ammunition in real weapons.   Additionally, basic trajectory data is provided at one meter intervals in ballistic tables from launch to the terminal range of a given projectile’s trajectory.  Unit effects data is provided at range increments appropriate to the weapon involved.  The unit effects to a constant height are used for constant height and to a constant range.  Unit effects to a constant height are used for horizontal targets; unit effects to a constant range are used for vertical targets.  Ballistic data used in the calculations include:  ballistic air density, ballistic air temperature, ballistic range wind, ballistic vertical wind, ballistic cross wind, altitude of the meteorological datum plane, grid declination, non-standard meteorological data, thrust factors, base burn time, weight of projectile, twist of rifling, diameter of projectile, center of gravity of projectile, and axial moment of inerta.  All data is integrated into the ballistic equations per weapon type and projectile type for calculations.  Small arms training systems must use this data on a per weapon type projectile type to accurately calculate the terminal point of the projectile on all targets based on the vertical and horizontal range. SMALL ARMS TRAJECTORIES AND VALIDATION:  Data calculated are basic trajectories at one-meter range increments to the given weapon’s maximum range, plus unit effects data.  The weapons covered are the M16A2, M249, M9, M203, MK19, and M1200.  During validation the following data is measured by placing a simulated target at one meter and then moving it to the maximum range at one-meter increments and   taking measurements of the simulated strike of the projectile at each increment.  Once this is done a comparison of the same data that is in government or commercially available ballistic data is conducted to ensure that they match within an acceptable range.  In the case of one of the systems the mean is + or - .0001.  2.4. Weapons must operate and function the same as actual service weapons. System operator must have the ability, at any time during scenarios, to inject real time malfunctions/stoppages. 2.5. Air supplied to the weapons must be supplied by a light weight, easily portable, low noise, air compressor that can be locally repaired or replaced with an off-the-shelf model, if needed. 2.6. When a weapon becomes unserviceable, to minimize training interruption the immediate availability of replacement weapons (within 24 hours) from the vendor is mandatory. 2.7. At a minimum, all weapons must have a one-year warranty on parts, labor, shipping and handling. 2.8. All weapons must have a minimum life expectancy of 225,000 rounds. 2.9. At a minimum, weapons and supporting systems must maintain a minimum in-commission rate of 85%. 

3. Simulator requirements to be included in the price of the system: 3.1. Software and licenses must be assigned per system, not location or individual. Each system will be equipped with original copies of all programs used in the system in the event a system must be reloaded. 3.2. The system must be a complete turnkey operation to include all power cords, cables, and other items to make the system operational. 3.3. System must be able to operate on European or US electrical standards without the use of additional external transformers. 3.4. System must come equipped with a 19-inch color CRT monitor or a 17-inch color flat panel monitor. 3.5. Each system must have a built in capability to edit any and all scenarios or courses of fire (COF) used on the system. Capability must allow for on-site, immediate customization and editing of scenarios/COF, ability to create infinite quantities of customized scenarios/COF, and the ability to create and edit localized specific scenarios/COF. If special cameras, camcorders, accessory kits, or equipment is needed they will be provided by the vendor as part of the system. 3.6. Computer used to operate the system must use high-speed processor and appropriate levels of memory to ensure no slipping, skipping, or pauses during scenarios/COF. 3.7. A high fidelity sound system must provide realistic sound and be fully controllable by the system operator at all times. 3.8. System must have global logistic and maintenance support capabilities in the event systems are deployed and require support. 3.9. System must have preloaded and ready-to-use AF-validated rifle Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC) of fire, the Tactical Rifle Qualification Course (TRQC) of fire, and pistol AFQC. Courses of fire will be validated by ACC prior acceptance of systems. 3.10. System must allow for different weapons to be fired simultaneously off the same system during marksmanship, collective, or judgmental training sessions. System must also be capable of allowing single weapons to be fired without affecting the course of fire or scenario of other students. This is needed when a single shooter must re-fire a phase or order of fire. 3.11. The system must have a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week help desk available for owners to access. Help desk must be staffed with knowledgeable personnel who can walk the owner through troubleshooting steps. 3.12. System must provide slow motion and real-time playback of scenarios and the shooters reactions, to include weapons tracking (both pre- and post-fire), weapon pitch, weapons cant, and scoring of hits. 3.13. Images must be projected by using a high fidelity projector. 3.14. Systems must be capable of providing individual and group data collection and storage. Data must be able to be printed out via high-speed color printer. 3.15. All scenarios must be contained within the system in a Windows-based format. Scenarios and COF may be loaded into the system, but run from tapes or disks. 3.16. System must come with a one-year, on-site warrantee support covering all parts, labor, shipping and handling.  3.17. Vendor must provide, at a minimum, annual program updates and maintenance to program files. 3.18. System must be capable of future expansion by adding on additional weapons, scenarios/COFs, additional hardware or software with no risk to owning units of compatibility issues between old and new items. 3.19. System operator must have the ability to view and provide physical feedback to students from the aggressors' prospective. This must be in the form of reusable, non-marking projectiles that will inflict limited pain to students, but will not have enough force to break the skin. Must be equipped with a minimum of 100 projectiles between 40 and 70 caliber and be delivered by an air driven or electronic cannon. System operator must have the option of selecting single- or multiple-round firing capabilities. Camera associated with the shoot back capability must be in color and should be viewed on the same operator display being used to monitor the scenario/COF being run. 3.20. System must be fully equipped to create and author localized judgmental and collective training scenarios. Localized scenarios must be capable of providing slow motion and real-time feedback and hit scoring. 

4. Training requirements to be included in the price of the system: 4.1. Each owning unit must be provided a minimum of a 1-day, on-site system operator course. This course must educate operators on all aspects of the system. At a minimum they must be educated on set up, installation, operation, troubleshooting, and packing the weapons and the system for shipment. 4.2.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to amend the previous synopsis posted to FedBizOpps on 22 November 2002 to increase the total number of follow-on production lots and the quantity of each lot of QF-4 aircraft being procured on a sole source basis from BAE Systems.   The previous synopsis reported that annual lot buys were expected for production lots 10-14.  This amendment increases that expectation by one annual lot buy to 10-15, thereby adding on additional lot.   This amendment also increases the best-estimated quantity from 18 to 24 aircraft per production lot.  There are no other changes to the previously synopsized presolicitation notice.

<DESC>The USAF Force Protection Battlelab is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) or emerging technologies that support food and water security measures.  Military personnel deploy to austere locations in support of contingency operations and humanitarian actions.  Conditions at these locations are typically classified as a “bare base”.  A bare base is described as having minimal essential facilities to house, sustain, and support operations to include, if required, a stabilized runway, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas.   TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  The food and water security measures should protect food and water in transit as well as at forward operating bases.  Contractor personnel could conduct the transport of food and water.  Technology areas to be evaluated will include: 1) test equipment, 2) physical security, and 3) monitoring of the food and water.  Technologies covering multiple areas are highly desired.  The technologies should be modular and capable of running on a variety of power sources to include battery, solar power, fuel cells, or other commercial power sources.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature or near mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical technology available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Air Force funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the Air Force, funding will be sought for concept and/or prototype demonstration.  NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 24 Oct 2003.  White papers should not exceed five pages plus cover letter.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to: Mr. Neil Huber of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at hubern@ctcnsc.org or mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  The single point of contact concerning this Sources Sought Notice is Mr. Huber.  You may contact Mr. Huber with any questions you may have at (814) 269-6591.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL BAA INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.  For copyright purposes, offerors are also advised that submitting a proposal implies express permission for Concurrent Technologies Corporation personnel to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the received proposals for the final report back to the client.

<DESC>The USAF Force Protection Battlelab (FPB) is exploring emerging technologies related to deployable sensors and sensor systems utilized by security personnel for remote airfield threat detection.  BACKGROUND: The United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) has an Area of Responsibility (AOR) extending from the United Kingdom to the tip of South Africa. USAFE personnel may deploy to remote austere locations within the USAFE AOR in support of contingency operations and humanitarian actions.  USAFE security forces require a readily deployable capability to detect threats/intrusions directed against personnel and resources operating on runways, taxiways, aircraft parking areas and other operational areas/facilities at these remote locations.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The envisioned technology would provide a maximized threat/intrusion detection capability (detection zone and detection performance) from a system that is extremely light-weight, rapidly deployable, and reliable.  Ideally, this capability can be part of the individual equipment of a Security Force member and should be modular, one-person deployable.  The detection system should be capable of operating with a variety of power sources to include battery, fuel cell, solar, and commercial power.  Detection sensor capability may employ any feasible intrusion alert/detection technology.  Sensors/equipment must be all-weather and capable of being monitored by individuals at the deployed location as well as at a central monitoring station. This capability may be stand-alone.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information to be used in a Battlelab study concerning emerging technologies available within the next 12-18 months which meet the stated capabilities.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this initiative/study, however, if research indicates that the technology will be available and transferable to the USAF, funding may be sought for concept and/or prototype demonstration.  NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to the AF Force Protection Battlelab’s technical representative:  Mr. Blaise Kordell of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at kordellb@ctcnsc.com or mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 24 Oct 2003.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Please use the following guidelines when submitting white papers:  a) TECHNICAL APPROACH: Please provide a brief high-level description of the proposed technology (no more than 1-2 pages).  Ideally, the technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system.  If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged (soft copies preferred).  b) RISKS.  Briefly address all potential risks.  c) TRAINING REQUIREMENTS: Describe the type of training that will be required to operate your system?  How long will the training take?  Briefly summarize how personnel would deploy and operate the system.  d) COMPATIBILITY: Explain system compatibility.  e) ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING: State the type of environmental testing that has been performed on the system.  What are the temperature and humidity limits within which the system will function properly?  f) COST.  What is the estimated cost or cost range of the proposed technology, including low volume production numbers and high volume production numbers?  g) AVAILABILITY: Provide technology maturity/availability information h) PREVIOUS WORK: Briefly explain any previous work you have done or are doing for military/civilian customers similar to what this BAA addresses (include demonstration information that supported that work).  The single point of contact concerning this Sources Sought Notice is Mr. Kordell.  You may contact Mr. Kordell with any questions you may have at (814) 269-2627.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL BAA INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP.

<SUBJECT>A--TEAMING OPPORTUNITY NO. 7 FOR THE MISSION AND SCIENCE MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY - 2004 (MSMT-2004) NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT (NRA)
<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop proposals for the Mission and Science Measurement Technology - 2004 (MSMT-2004) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released a draft NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled, "Mission and Science Measurement Technology - 2004" (see http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_r/open.cfm). The MSMT theme seeks proposals for exploratory research and technology development in the Enabling Concepts and Technologies Program (ECT), which defines new system concepts and develops new technologies to enable scientific measurements in support of the Aerospace Technology Enterprise mission.  The ECT program explores revolutionary aerospace systems, and performs fundamental research and development of high-payoff technologies.  Program objectives are to identify, develop, and transfer breakthrough technologies that have broad potential across many types of systems to provide increased scientific return at lower cost, and to enable missions and capabilities beyond current horizons.  The ECT program is on front end of the enabling technology pipeline that supplies the focused technology development programs of the NASA Enterprises.   This NRA solicits technologies in three major areas: 1) Advanced Measurement and Detection Technology; 2) Large Aperture Technology; and 3) Low Power Microelectronics Technology  (These three technology areas can be viewed in greater detail via the NRA cite noted above.) The ECT program primarily focuses on early stage technologies at Technology Readiness Levels of between 1 and 3, unless otherwise noted in the NRA. (For definitions of Technology Readiness Levels, see Appendix B of the NASA Technology Plan at http://technologyplan.nasa.gov)	The technology requirements guide future development of component and subsystem technologies, with emphasis on efficiency, miniaturization, integration, and resiliency.  The goal is to capture innovative ideas from the external community, to leverage emerging technologies, and to complement NASA capabilities in critical areas.  Successful proposals must outline a well-structured program (for up to three years) for development culminating in a proof-of-concept demonstration at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3-4 by the end of the effort for both the Advanced Measurement and Detection Technology and Large Aperture Technology. (NOTE: The Low Power Microelectronics Technology area requires that proposed activities have an entry TRL of 3 or 4 and that the activity demonstrate a minimum TRL 5 at the end of the proposed activity.) NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the ECT Program to develop proposals and execute proof of concept development and/or component breadboard validation. Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in proof of concept development and/or component breadboard validation contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide proof of concept development and/or component breadboard validation consistent with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criterion evaluates the proposers' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control This criterion evaluates the proposers' ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposers' facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria.  All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Greg Manuel, Mail Stop 469, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: g.s.manuel@larc.nasa.gov. The due date for submission is COB October 1, 2003. Procurement questions should be directed to Tom Weih, NASA Office of Procurement, 757-864-3878; c.t.weih@larc.nasa.gov Technical questions should be addressed to each of the technical points of contact indicated below for each technical area. The following LaRC technology proposals are seeking partnerships.   Development of a Programmable Resolution CMOS Linear Detector Array with High Dynamic Range, Technical Contact: Frank Novak, (757) 864-1862, frank.j.novak@nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners for the development of a Linear Array Active Pixel Sensor (APS) for future Earth-Science and Solar Exploration missions. These missions will require CMOS detectors that are both low power and low mass. The APS linear array detector will be an array of 1 x 512 pixels with the pixel size to be 10um x 250um tailored to spectroscopic applications. The spectral response will cover 400 to 1050nm range. Below are the technical objectives for the Programmable Resolution CMOS Linear Detector array: ·	 High quantum efficiency at 1020nm (&gt; 10%) ·  Programmable spatial resolution ·	Programmable integration time · Timing and control on chip ·	12 bit A/D on chip

<SUBJECT>R -- OIG Audit Survey & Field Work and Audit Quality Control Reviews
<DESC>This is a formal public announcement, in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 (Revised May 29, 2003), that the Department of Education (ED) will conduct an A-76 Streamlined Competition for audit survey and field work and audit quality control reviews.  Audit survey and field work services being competed include tasks that would typically be performed by an auditor during the survey and detailed fieldwork phases of an audit assignment.  The service provider staff would be responsible for completing specified steps (or portions of specified steps) detailed in a survey/audit program for a particular assignment.  The tasks would be primarily performed on site at the audited organization.  Audit quality control review services being competed include tasks that would typically be performed by an auditor performing a Quality Control Review of an Independent Public Accountant's (IPA) audit of ED programs.  The tasks would be primarily performed on-site at the IPA's offices.  The purpose of the study is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method of providing these services for the Department.  The work is currently performed by ED Office of the Inspector General staff.  The competition will involve 10 FTE positions.  An agency may develop an estimated contract price for performing the activity with a private sector source using documented market research or soliciting cost proposals in accordance with the FAR.  ED will use documented market research for this Streamlined Competition.  In accordance with A-76, ED will complete a Streamlined Competition Form to compare the estimated cost of agency performance with the estimated cost of private sector or public reimbursable performance.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. Prospective providers are advised that a solicitation will not be issued if the cost of contract performance is determined to be greater than the cost of in-house performance by Government personnel. No solicitation exists at this time. Any solicitation resulting from this Streamlined Competition will be made available on www.fedbizopps.gov if and when it is released.  The projected end date of the streamlined competition is on or before December 26, 2003.
