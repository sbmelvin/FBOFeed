<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure a membership from Metropolitan Research and Education Network (MREN) on a sole source basis.

Membership in the Chicago, Illinois area Metropolitan Research and Education Network (MREN) consortium is required in order for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to communicate and exchange data with domestic and international biomedical researchers via advanced communication systems.  This membership will need to continue as long as necessary into the foreseeable future so that the NLM can continue to communicate with its users and research partners (currently via dedicated high-speed communications circuits established from the NIH Consolidated Collocation Site (NCCS). Many NLM users domestically and internationally access its resources via high-performance connections at their respective institutions which in turn connect with their regional aggregation points which in turn connect to their national research and education networks all of which enables continued collaboration and advances in biomedical research and development.  This worldwide network of advanced research and education networks and their peering arrangements is the structure by which this happens.  The MREN operates, in the Chicago, Illinois area the regional aggregation point for traffic to/from many domestic and international destinations (see www.mren.org for details).

NLM plans to continue to make use of the Next Generation Internet/Internet2 services available through the Metropolitan Research and Education Network (MREN) organization for continued redundant access to the domestic and international R&D advanced networking community. Membership in this consortium provides access to these services and is necessary for continued advanced Internet traffic exchange. Previously this link was used as a back-up link but is now to be used for increasingly higher volumes of traffic.

The Metropolitan Research and Education Network (MREN) organization is the only known provider of advanced high-performance connectivity services in the Chicago area to both the domestic and international research and development community and as such is uniquely qualified for this work because of their background, expertise, and peering arrangements with regional, domestic and international research and education institutions, networks and projects. Additionally delays of up to six months would be necessary to move the existing telecommunications link (NCCS?MREN) connecting to the MREN facilities to a new location and this would interrupt the existing heavily used Internet2 communications link used by the NLM operating now between the NCCS and the MREN.

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisitions of  Non- Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR): http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html. The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site: FAR 52.213-4, Terms and Conditions?Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Items) (December 2007). However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government. Proposals must include pricing information. Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice. EMAIL OR FAXED PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to procure one hundred-six (106) Telephone Test Set, P/N 704A/NTS1/FAA/SS, NSN: 6625-01-540-2319-1, in support of the National FAA Test Equipment Program (NFTEP).  This equipment will replace obsolete Test Equipment currently being utilized on National Air Space System (NAS).  The purchase of the Telephone Test Sets manufactured by CXR Larus Corp. includes features, which are unique in the test industry.  The Selective Signaling 2-digit and Selective Signaling 3-digit features are required for maintaining the critical voice communications network utilized by the Air Route Traffic Control Centers in support of the NAS. These units are unique in their capability to emulate both the switch and customer equipment (station) components, meaning they can both transmit digits and receive/analyze digits. These units are the only known equipment with this capability.   The vendor, CXR Larus Corporation, owns the proprietary technical documentation, engineering design, and the best market value for this requirement.  The FAA Logistics Center does not have any drawings or specification; therefore CXR Larus Corporation is the only known source of supply able to meet this requirement.  The Government does not have the test capability, evaluation criteria, or technical documentation available to allow other sources to manufacture these items.  To receive consideration as a potential source, any other concern must provide in writing a complete set of system specification drawings, all required standards and testing specifications, test plans, part lists, and proof of rights to use the data.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.   Documentation must be received by the FAA, NAS Contracting Team (AMQ-210), 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73125, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, April 11, 2008.  Hand-carried responses (or responses sent by overnight delivery) shall be delivered to Room 313 of the Multi-Purpose Building located at 6500 South MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169.  Responses must be sealed and labeled as follows:  Kelly Tillery, Market Survey No. DTFAAC-08-R-55312; due 2:00 p.m. CST, April 11, 2008.  Documentation must include name and telephone number of a point of contact.    Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further acquisition action by the Government.  Any information received as a result of this announcement will not be provided to other contractors and will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The final determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Loren Frei, Contracting Officer, Phone 206-526-6370, Fax 206-526-6025, Email Loren.Frei@noaa.gov
<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), on a sole source basis with Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) only one responsible source.  The Government intends to acquire services indicated below using FAR Part 15. All prospective contractors must be able to satisfy the following requirement:  

BACKGROUND
Sampling of the U.S. North Pacific albacore fishery is vital to research activities at SWFSC.  The sampling program is currently the only method of obtaining data from this fishery.  Participation in the program has been completely voluntary until 1999, when the High-seas Fishing Compliance Act (HSFCA) made submission of logbooks mandatory for vessels fishing outside the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).  Starting on April 11, 2005, all logbooks were mandatory as part of the Highly Migratory Species Fisheries Management Plan for the U.S. west coast.  Data have been collected since 1961, and the continuation of the program will maintain the continuity of the data series. These data are essential in assessing the status of the North Pacific albacore stocks. The data and associated analyses help the Center provide needed advice to the United States fisheries management councils and international fisheries negotiators for the management of North Pacific albacore stocks.

OVERVIEW OF REQUIREMENTS
The contractor shall maintain the system for collection of U.S. Pacific albacore length frequencies and landings (troll, baitboat and CPFV).  The contractor shall measure the fish for fork length as vessels unload their catches at ports in California, Washington and Oregon.  The contractor shall allocate sampling among the ports to obtain a sampling coverage as close to 100% as possible.
Fishermen are already submitting landing information to State agencies.  Therefore, the contractor shall obtain full cooperation from the States of Washington, Oregon, and California in this sampling program, and shall have access to confidential information of the three states to obtain vessel landings by trip, and number of vessel trips by port during the fishing year.
Also, to increase coverage rates of landings, the contractor shall develop contacts with fish buyers, or others who know when vessels will be landing.  Once contacts are established, samplers shall monitor contacts daily to get information on landing times for vessels.

WORK SPECIFICATIONS
The contractor shall provide the following service:

1.	Distribute the Government provided U.S. Pacific Albacore Logbook to albacore fishermen at the start of each season. Logbooks should be distributed at the unloading ports as vessels leave for the fishing grounds.  NMFS will also mail logbooks to vessels.

2.	Do not collect logbooks from fishermen at the end of trips.  Samplers are to remind vessel captains that they are required to submit logbooks directly to NMFS, c/o TBD.  Samplers are to provide addressed envelopes to fishermen for mailing their logbooks and guidance in correctly completing the logbooks.

3.	At the time of each vessel unloading, albacore catches shall be measured for fork length.  The maximum number of fish to be sampled per vessel unloading is 400.  The average number of fish measured per vessel landing is usually 50. Coverage rates as close as possible to 100% of the landings shall be maintained for each port.  A minimum sample of fifty fish (or all fish if less than 50 are unloaded) should be measured from each vessel landing. If fish are unloaded by size and access for sampling is limited to sorted fish, a separate sample (25 fish minimum or all fish if less than 25 are in the size group) should be taken from each size group and the unloading weight of each size group should be recorded on the sampling form.  If an observer was onboard the sampler should follow the usual routine as if no observer was onboard but note in the comments section that an observer was onboard.  Data must be emailed to TBD at the end of each sampling day.

4.	Keep abreast of the sampling situation and suggest modifications to sampling design/procedures based on changes in landing procedures or changes in the fishery.

5.	Keep records of vessel landings noting which landing were sampled and reasons for not sampling.  These records should detail every albacore landing whether sampled or not.

DELIVERABLES
I.  The Contractor shall provide the following items to the SWFSC by February 1 following the close of each fishing season.

   A. Provide the following summaries:

1.	Estimated landings (lbs) of albacore by port.
2.	Estimated landings (lbs) by gear type.
3.	Estimated number of trips by port.
4.	Estimated number of vessels by port.
5.	Landing tonnage for each vessel trip.

      B.  Suggestions for improving sampling for the coming year.

II. The contractor shall provide the following during the fishing season.

A.	A completed Monthly Port Sampling Report by the 15th of the month following each sampling month. Also provide any updates to the past month?s sampling activities. The sampling activity information shall include: 
a.	Vessel unloadings
b.	Length-frequency samples collected
B.	Provide oral reports at meetings or by telephone on sampling and status of the fishery as requested by SWFSC. An annual meeting may be held to discuss sampling.

C.	Suggestions for modifications to sampling given changes in landing operations or locations.
 
D.	Originals of albacore length measurement samples or electronic copies of sampling data. 

The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract for the above services.  The NAICS Code is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This notice represents the only official notice of this solicitation.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All interested concerns must submit documentation in writing demonstrating their capability, expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the necessary work to Loren.Frei@noaa.gov no later than May 12, 2008.

<SUBJECT>A -- Broad Agency Announcement for Innovative Technologies and Methodologies for Reducing Various Environmental Problems
<SOLNBR>AFCEEBAA-08-001
<CONTACT>MaryJo Boldt, Contract Specialist, Phone 210-536-4505, Email maryjo.boldt@brooks.af.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Restoration Branch, Technology Transfer Office (TDV) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement is open for one year and will be advertised annually. This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies to reduce environmental impacts from current and past Air Force (AF) operations and apply to Air Force installations worldwide.  The key focus of this effort is to further develop demonstration/field-tested remediation, contaminated site characterization and monitoring, and pollution prevention technologies and methodologies that serve as an innovative means to save money and time while achieving compliance with all air, soil, and water regulatory requirements and Air Force policies and technical guidance.  The goal is to identify more technically advanced, efficient, effective, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective solutions than are currently available.  Such technologies and methodologies should aid the US Air Force in reaching the remedy-in-place (RIP) goal of 2012 or optimizing current remediation or monitoring systems already in place.  The purpose of this acquisition is to apply promising demonstration/field-tested innovative technologies and methodologies. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&D) phase.  The remedial technologies areas of interest include, but are not limited to, effective dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) characterization, monitoring, fate and transport, detection, and remediation; improve/optimize remediation and long-term monitoring (LTM) technologies; assessment and mitigation of hazards associated with vapor intrusion; remedial techniques and methods to more effectively treat soil and groundwater contaminated with chlorinated solvents; implementation of rapid site characterization through definitive field-based analytical methods for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi VOCs, and other common contaminants.  Additional areas of interest include innovative pollution prevention techniques, innovative site characterization approaches and tools, new and innovative quality assurance methodologies, and innovative monitoring and optimization systems for existing remediation operations (e.g., pump-and-treat) including sensors and data management systems. 

Proposal submittal is a two-phase process.  Phase I Offerors submit proposals by completing a short questionnaire on the AFCEE BAA web page developed specifically to facilitate proposal submittal in the BAA program. The requested information includes:  description of the technology (synonymous with methodology, as applicable) being proposed and a discussion of the technical benefits to include the type of site and specific problem addressed; contamination and media treated; description of how project supports the Remedy-in-Place (RIP)/Response Complete (RC) Goal of 2012; qualifications of the offeror; estimated cost range of the demonstration/field testing of the technology; and approximated time to complete the proposed effort.  Limits to the length of each section are noted in the web-based proposal form.   PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 29 APRIL 2008.  Phase I submittals received after 29 April 2008, may or may not be evaluated.  However, these proposals will be held for possible action until expiration of this BAA. The Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the same selection criteria used to evaluate Phase II proposals. It is critical that the offeror convey the above information accurately and concisely so that proposal evaluators can judge the merits of the proposed demonstration/field testing of the technology. Those proposals that are judged innovative and meet program requirements are selected for further evaluation in Phase II.  Offerors whose proposals are not selected for Phase II are notified electronically of this decision, while those selected are similarly notified and invited to submit a Phase II proposal as an attachment to the electronic format provided via Internet link.  To be eligible for award submission of Phase I is required. 

	Phase II proposals are to include expanded descriptions/discussion of the following information:  Technology or methodology proposed including results of previous development/demonstration/field testing, pilot-scale or treatability studies. The technology or methodology must be described in sufficient detail to enable reviewers to understand the nature and probability of successful application. The proposal shall include the types of contaminants treated, the media (i.e., soil, groundwater) treated, and any limitations known to affect the application of the technology or methodology.  Benefits to the USAF of using the proposed technology or methodology. This should include a comparison with existing technologies or methodologies used to treat the same contaminants, and how the proposed technology or methodology improves cleanup over existing technology or methodology and/or lowers the cost of environmental restoration/prevention.  The objectives of the proposed technology or methodology demonstration/field testing, the tasks to be accomplished during the demonstration/field testing, the project schedule, and the location or type of site recommended for the demonstration/field test.  The qualifications of the offeror to successfully perform the technology or methodology demonstration/field test.
	
	Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are provided a link in the electronic notification by which the Phase II proposals are to be submitted. Phase II proposals shall be submitted as attachments to an electronic submittal form that is accessed via the notification from AFCEE.  The technical proposal shall be limited to 10 pages, typed at 10 pitch or larger type, single spaced, and single sided, on sheets 8.5 X 11 with 1 margins.  This page limitation is inclusive of indexes, photographs, fold-outs, appendices, and attachments.  Pages in excess of this limitation will not be evaluated by Government evaluators. Suggested inclusion within the 10 page limitation are: (1) four pages describing the proposed technology or methodology, (2) one page containing a SOW, (3) one page discussing the capability of the offeror, references and point of contact for the demonstration/field test, (4) three pages describing proposed schedule for demonstration/field test, past experience and performance, and other places the technology or methodology has been demonstrated, and (5) one page list of key personnel that will perform the demonstration/field test. The cost proposal has no page limitations; however, offerors are requested to use five (5) pages as a goal.

<DESC>The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research (DESPR) of the Eunice Kennedy Schriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIHCD, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to award a contract for a data coordinating and management center to support the original research projects conducted by its investigators .  This is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees or less.  It is anticipated that one indefinite delivery /indefinite quantity (IDIQ), cost reimbursement contract will be awarded for a 5-year period with performance beginning on or about September 15, 2008.         

The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research (DESPR) of the Eunice Kennedy Schriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIHCD) proposes to establish a web based data coordinating and management center to support the original research projects conducted by its investigators.  The Division encompasses three branches:  1) Epidemiology Branch; 2) Biometry Branch and 3) Prevention Research Branch [http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/despr/].  Central to the DESPRs mission is to design, implement, and direct epidemiologic, behavioral and biostatistical research.  This includes reproductive, perinatal and pediatric epidemiologic research as well as research addressing child and adolescent health behaviors.  Original biostatistical methods also are developed motivated by analytic problems encountered in the design or conduct of the epidemiologic or health behavioral research.  As an intramural Division, DESPR is charged with research aimed at answering critical data gaps within its mission by utilizing state-of-the-art methodologies and technologies.  In addition, DESPR investigators are charged with the timely communication of research findings to both professional and lay audiences.  The Division typically implements 1-3 new studies annually on a government fiscal year basis subject to funding, with each study lasting from approximately 2-5 years.  This includes both epidemiologic and health behavioral research within the following broad domains and as described below:  etiologic research; clinical prediction; clinical efficacy or intervention trials; behavioral intervention trials with randomization at the individual or family/school level.  

The objectives of this contract are for the NICHD to obtain on behalf of DESPR:  1) a state-of-the-art web based data coordination and management system that offer access to all aspects of the data for each study in real time capable; 2) the ability of the web based data management system to track biospecimens or other types of data that may be collected in clinical sites or in study participants homes; 3) the production of a fully documented mega data file, supporting data files including quality assurance documentation and analytic files or other requirements as needed; 4) the ability to provide or subcontract for specific biostatistical methologic expertise and/or laboratory analyses as required for each study; and 5) the ability to provide other essential logistical support such as scheduling conference calls, steering committee meetings or data safety and monitoring boards (DSMBs) meetings along with the preparation of minutes for all such activities.

The Epidemiology and Prevention Research Branches typically conduct research that utilizes one of two types of designs.  First is the prospective cohort design for the longitudinal collection of data (particularly at critical or sensitive windows within human reproduction and development), biospecimens, third party data (e.g., fertility monitors or other PDA-type devices), and increasingly digital data (e.g., x-rays, MRIs, operative photographs, camera outfitted motor vehicles for young drivers).  Other important aspects of human reproduction and development that impact data base design and management is the couple dependent approach for data collection and analysis and the clustering of reproductive and pregnancy outcomes.  Study covariates are frequently time-varying and further dictate data structure.  In addition, the Prevention Research Branch often randomizes clusters (e.g., schools, summer camps) underscoring the importance of a data structure suitable for the implementation of hierarchical modeling.  Some research involves individuals while other research involves couples or families.  Hence, the ability of the offeror to support individual or higher order units of analysis is essential.  The second typical study design is the randomized trial.  The Epidemiology Branch conducts both randomized clinical trials aimed at assessing clinical efficacy or intervention trials.  The Prevention Research Branch typically conducts intervention trials involving individuals, families, summer camps, or schools as the randomization unit.  


General Notes to Offerors:

*The web based data management structure should be able to accommodate up to three new studies annually with each lasting from 2-5 years.  Studies largely involve prospective (observational) cohort designs or randomized trials.  Longitudinal capture of data from multiple sources and biospecimens is typically a part of the DESPRs research portfolio. 

*The web based data management system shall accommodate each project but ensure the flexibility to meet specific needs per forthcoming studies protocols.  The web based system should have the following characteristics:  1) flexible data collection including the ability to upload files from multiple sites or sources (e.g., labs, clinical facilities, study participants homes); 2) ability to accommodate multiple remote users (e.g., study participants entering data from homes) including flexibility in accommodating varying browsers; 3) ability to accommodate varying types of data including digital files; 4) ability to provide or subcontract of expert biostatistical or laboratory services as requested by the Government per the studys needs; 5) ability to provide logistical support for the scheduling, hosting and minute taking of steering committee meetings, DSMBs, and similar activities; and 6) ability to deliver interim and final databases and supporting documentation in formats requested by the government.



*DESPR intends for the successful offeror to be physically located offsite, but to have or establish a local office available within a 50-mile radius of 6100 Executive Blvd., Rockville, MD to facilitate regular interaction and in-person meetings needed for maximizing success.  

*The first two projects (FY08 and FY09 starts) are both prospective cohort studies involving newly pregnant women who will be followed through pregnancy and delivery (or pregnancy loss). Longitudinal collection of data from multiple sources (e.g., women completing self administered questionnaires or structured interviews, medical record abstraction, pregnancy journals, ultrasonography, Doppler measurements) is planned along with the collection of biospecimens (e.g., blood, urine, buccal swabs) at repeated intervals timed to gestation.  Approximately 3,000 women will be recruited in each of the two studies. Digital diagnostic files (e.g., ultrasounds, Doppler measurements) are expected for both studies.  Subcontracting for laboratory research is also anticipated for both projects along with biostatistical expertise in repeated measurement analysis, longitudinal analysis, and in Bioinformatics. 

*Two to three new research projects are anticipated for FY10 of which one is likely to include a randomize trial design.  All will be prospective in design with longitudinal capture of a multitude of data, digital files and biospecimens.

*DESPRs research focuses exclusively on people and, as such, the offeror must have proven expertise in the preparation of study materials needed for obtaining (often multiple) institutional review boards, Office of Management & Budget (OMB) applications, certificates of confidentiality, investigational new drug (IND) applications, and other necessary documentation.  In addition, proven expertise in the development and maintenance of manual of procedures (MOP) is required.  Changes to the MOP are expected to be documented in real time within the web based data management structure and to remain as a part of the official audit trail.

*Key personnel shall be designated specifically for each Task and may include the Principal Investigator, Study Manager, Biostatistician, Web Programmer and/or Data Manager.

Viable mercury monitoring programs require a number of tests to be performed and passed, such as calibration error/linearity/converter checks and relative accuracy tests; all of which require NIST - traceable mercury calibration  gas standards.  NIST has the responsibility for providing standard reference materials and procedures for EPA, other Federal, State and Local agencies, and industry to use to trace measured gas concentrations used in environmental monitoring back to these reference materials.  In turn, EPA is  responsible for developing traceability protocols for linking gas concentrations back to a reference material provided by NIST.  In addition, this purchase order is a direct follow-on effort to that commenced under the previous purchase order (Order No. EP07H001888).  All inquires and concerns  must be addressed to Andrea L.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the electric distribution system for the Wisconsin Air National Guard (ANG) located at General Mitchell Internationa l Airport Wisconsin, to We Energies.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  We Energies (Contractor) will assume ownership  of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, an d equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility s ystem will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The electric system being privatized is described as follows: The Wisconsin Air National Guard (ANG) 128th Air Refueling Wing (ARW) is located about 6.5 miles south of the center of Mil waukee and 2.5 miles west of Lake Michigan.  The 128th ARWs mission is to provide aerial in-flight refueling and passenger/cargo transportation.  The base currently flies KC-135 Air Refueling Tankers. <BR>The 128th ARW employs 980 Air Guard personnel, 294 technicians, and 39 civilians.  The base maintains approximately 26 buildings and structures with the breakdown being 16 industrial and 10 administrative buildings.  The Wisconsin Air National Guard was established in 1947 and located at Mitchell Field.  The 128th ARW occupies 63.4 acres leased from the State of Wisconsin.  The larger parcel, 58.5 acres is located east of the General Mitchell International Airport north-south runway.  It houses the apron, hangars, and most of the base operation buildings.   The smaller parcel, 4.9 acres, is located to the west of the General Mitchell International Airport north-south runway, and is adjacent to the north side of the former 440th Air Force Reserve Station.  The smaller parcel of land is referred to as the Gua rd West and it houses an office building and a maintenance facility.  Additional land adjacent to the east side of the base has been acquired to allow expansion in the future.  This land is currently undeveloped and separated from the main portion of the b ase by a large railroad embankment.  We Energies supplies the electrical commodity to the 128th Wisconsin Air national Guard ARW.  The 13.2-kilovolt (kV) distribution line enters the base and passes  through the We Energies master meter into a Base owned s ubstation located on Tanker Avenue on the east side of the 128h ARW.  The primary circuits leave the substation on an overhead circuit heading south and on an underground circuit going north.  Two transformers in the substation also directly feed the hanga rs to the west. The electrical distribution system at guard west area is already privatized and is not included in this contract. Government ownership starts at the demand side of the master meter.  From the substation three-phase, three-wire circuits serv e the Bases facilities.  The distribution system contains three-phase transformers ranging from 150 to 500 kilovolt amperes (kVA), single phase transformers ranging from 15 to 75 kVA, utility poles, switches, fuses, and streetlight fixtures.  Constructio n dates from the underground and overhead circuits, and other system components, range from the 1960s to the 2000.  The overall system appears to be in fair con dition, although some of it is showing signs of aging.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2003 and no offers were received.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Governmen t intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall inclu de: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this syno psis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered sol ely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR><BR>Interested sources shall contact SMSGT James Ensign, 1919 E Grange Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53207<BR>Original Point of Contact<BR>SMSGT James Ensign, james.ensign@w imilw.ang.af.mil. <BR>Places of Performance<BR>            Location: 128th ARW, Air National Guard Station, Milwaukee, Wisconsin Country:  USA

For this procurement the GSA Project Team shall evaluate all properly received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-2, ?Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection process?. As defined in FAR 15.101-2 (a) the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. FAR 15.101-1 (b) (1) states that the evaluation factors and significant sub factors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the RFP. The GSA Project Team shall utilize the following factor as the requirement for acceptability:  Relevant Past Performance:  A minimum of three (3) projects completed in the past five (5) years that demonstrate the company's experience on projects that are similar to this project in terms of complexity, size and dollar value.

<DESC>This announcement provides an update to the MiDAESS program draft request for proposals (DRFP).  The government received 679 questions from industry since releasing the DRFP on 30 Jan 08 (including duplicate questions).  As stated in the DRFP cover letter, it was a "very draft" document and industry feedback was encouraged for additional market research.  The questions are being reviewed and the acquisition strategy for MiDAESS is being finalized in parallel.  Once the revisions to this acquisition strategy are complete, a revised DRFP will be released to provide the updated overarching MiDAESS strategy as well as provide responses to industry questions.  An updated schedule for release of the revised DRFP will be published in the FedBizOpps as soon as it is finalized.  

The government received a substantial number of organizational conflict of interest (OCI) questions.  The OCI questions and other information received from potential offerors are being assessed.  Potential OCI restrictions are being evaluated to ensure actual or potential conflicts are appropriately addressed as part of the overall MiDAESS acquisition strategy.  Individual one-on-one meetings as requested by offerors relative to OCI issues will be conducted soon.  
 
The MiDAESS program consists of a number of separate procurements for contractor support services.  The information received to date from industry has been of great value to the Agency in improving the overall strategy.    

Questions should be sent to the MiDAESS e-mail address:  MiDAESS@mda.mil.

This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive e-mail notification when information, solicitation, and any amendments and future documents regarding this acquisition are issued and available for downloading.

Respondents are cautioned that ?standard? marketing brochures may not provide sufficient and specific information to enable the government to evaluate an offeror?s capabilities relative to the contemplated requirement relative to the topics identified above and thus offerors should consider tailoring their capability statement accordingly.  The capability statement is limited to five (5) pages.  

2. Business Size Status: The government will evaluate responses to this sources sought synopsis to determine the acquisition strategy (e.g. full and open competition versus a set aside).

<SUBJECT>R -- FY09 Annual Financial Audit Statement
<SOLNBR>SAQMMA08R0199
<RESPDATE>060208
<ARCHDATE>06172008
<CONTACT>Frederick Washington, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-875-4985, Fax 703-875-4985, Email washingtonfj@state.gov
<DESC>Nature and Volume of the Proposed Work

To perform the 2009 U.S. Department of State (Department) financial statements audit OIG needs the services of a certified public accounting firm that has professionally qualified personnel with experience in CFO audits and is able to dedicate full time, federally-experienced professional staff members from early July 2009 to early December 2009.  The Department?s assets total about $45 Billion and its annual budget exceeds $30 Billion. 

The contractor shall:

?	Determine and report on whether the financial statements and related notes present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and net position; net costs, changes in net position, and  budgetary resources, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
?	Perform appropriate procedures consistent with AICPA Auditing Standard AU Section 558, "Required Supplementary Information," on all Required Supplementary Information included in the Department?s FY 2009 consolidated financial statements.  
?	Determine whether risk-assumed information (including projections of pensions) is presented fairly in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 5, and any subsequent revisions.  If a specialist is used for this work, the auditor shall comply with guidance in AU Section 336, ?Using the Work of a Specialist.? 
?	Assess whether the other accompanying information, or its manner of presentation, is materially consistent with the information in the Annual Statements.
?	Evaluate and report on internal control and the internal control environment related to the FY 2009 consolidated financial statements for the Department.  This should include, but not be limited to, obtaining an understanding of the components of internal control, assessing the level of control risk relevant to the assertions embodied in the classes of transactions, account balances, and disclosures components of the financial statements, and performing tests of the Department?s internal controls.  
o	Review information system general and application controls in the Department?s applications that are significant to the financial statements to the extent necessary to (1) conclude whether general controls are properly designed and operating effectively, (2) consider application controls as part of the internal control assessment in the financial statement audit, and (3) support the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) assessment. 
?	Obtain an understanding of the process by which the agency identifies and evaluates weaknesses required to be reported under the Federal Managers? Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) and related agency implementing procedures.  Compare material weaknesses disclosed during the audit with those material weaknesses reported in the agency's FMFIA report that relate to the financial statements.  If material weaknesses were disclosed during the audit that were not reported in the Department?s FMFIA report, auditor will determine whether the failure to detect and report material weaknesses constitutes a significant deficiency or material weakness in the entity?s internal control.  In order to address this objective, auditor should obtain information on the Department?s efforts to implement OMB Circular A-123, Appendix A.
?	Perform tests of compliance with laws and regulations that could have a direct and material effect on the Department?s FY 2009 financial statements, including FFMIA.
?	For allocation transfers, coordinate early with ?child? agencies to ensure that adequate audit coverage will be provided.  
?	Determine whether the special-purpose financial statements and accompanying notes present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, net costs and changes in net position, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the presentation requirements set forth in the Treasury Financial Manual (TFM), Chapter 4700.
?	Obtain an understanding of internal control over the financial reporting process for the special-purpose financial statements and perform tests of those controls.  
?	Perform tests of compliance with TFM Chapter 4700.  
?	Assess the reasonableness of FY 2009 retirement, health, and life insurance withholdings/contributions, and employee headcount information provided to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as required by OMB Bulletin 07-04.  Comply with any additional guidance issued by either OPM or OMB during FY 2009.

The contractor must demonstrate that it has successfully performed agency-wide financial statement audits of large highly complex and decentralized agencies, and issued unqualified auditors? opinions on time and in full compliance with all federal government and professional standards.  It must have had these audits assessed by the Government Accountability Office to give assurance that they complied with the GAO/PCIE FAM on these audits.

Also, the contractor must demonstrate (1) its qualifications to assess the effectiveness of the Department?s information systems control environment; (2) that its IT specialists have a thorough working knowledge of FISCAM; (3) experience auditing a government agency with multiple financial management systems; (4) past experience in successfully transitioning to be the new auditor of a large complex agency; (5) experience in auditing pension funds and working with actuaries; (6) experience auditing agencies with a significant amount of grant activity; and (7) experience auditing working capital funds.
All personnel assigned to the audit must have Secret security clearances.  





Location of Work

Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Area and other domestic and foreign locations including developing states.  The Department has embassies, consulates, and other posts in over 260 locations, and processes financial data in Washington, D.C., Charleston, S.C., and Bangkok, Thailand.  Auditors will need to perform work at 8 to 10 overseas locations.   

Responses shall be ten pages or fewer.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT. ANY COST INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHALL BE BORNE BY THE OFFEROR AND WILL NOT BE CHARGED TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR REIMBURSEMENT. 

This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of interested parties and potential small business (e.g. small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned business, HUBZone, small disadvantage business and women-owned small business) that can conduct scientific study of the risk of exposure to radiation in the environment.

The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from all parties and qualified small business firms under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710, employee standard 500. Firms should have the capability to perform scientific services for the study of the risk of exposure to radiation. We need information in radiation risk analysis relating to cancer, other chronic diseases caused by radiation, or adverse reproductive outcomes. 

The contractor must have diverse skills in risk analysis, toxicology, health physics, environmental exposure assessment, and estimation of health risks from chemicals and radionuclides and be able to satisfy the data quality objectives consistent with the planning, performing and assessing dose or risk-based released criteria based on Multi- Agency Radiation Survey & Site Investigation Manual(MARSSIM) guidelines.

The contractor will often be required to design and manage web pages or large databases and write computer programs. The contractor will require public communications skills for tasks such as writing newsletters and fact sheets, creating Web pages, preparing training material, and preparing multi-media public presentations.  NCEH intends, within the limitations stated herein, to satisfy these requirements through the continued use of in-house scientific, technical and operational staff and through task orders under this contract.  Because the timing and size of task orders cannot be entirely predicted, the work load may fluctuate during the year.

Businesses having the capability to perform this work are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) in order for the Government to determine acquisition strategy for this procurement. Capable offerors must clearly demonstrate that they possess expertise, experience and a thorough comprehensive knowledge in the study of radiation exposure risk analysis. The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information regarding the understanding of radiation exposures to the environment and the methodology of risk analysis.

SOC shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, and business size and status (e.g. small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned business, HUBZone, small disadvantage business and women-owned small business). The NAICS code for this requirement is 541710.

Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statement via email to Thaddeus Rollins at tnr6@cdc.gov.  The SOC is limited to 5 pages, single-spaced, 12 font, Times Roman. The subject line of the email shall be ?Scientific Services Radiation in the Environment Capability Statement? Responses are due by April 16, 2008.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice. Statement of Work. The project will provide for the renovation of as much as 19.2 miles of Mercury Highway at the Nevada Test Site (NTS).  The main gate at the NTS is approximately 65 north of Las Vegas, Nevada.  The work location for this project is approximately 10 miles north of the NTS main gate within the boundaries of the NTS.

This renovation consists of Roadbed Modification (NDOT, Section 305) and applying a new three-inch thick asphalt overlay. Mercury Highway is a 26-foot wide road. The renovated road will include two twelve-foot wide travel lanes and two one-foot wide paved shoulders. The scope of work will also include renovation of passing lanes and transitions from intersecting roadways, replacement of a small amount of CMP culverts, and all associated striping and signage. All work will be performed in accordance with the design drawings and specifications to be provided by NSTec.

The construction subcontractor shall provide all labor (including appropriate craft personnel, field engineer, safety representative, superintendent, and office support personnel), material, and equipment necessary to perform the scope of work. The construction subcontractor shall be responsible traffic control, including supplying and installing all signs and traffic control barriers in accordance with an approved traffic control plan. As there are no reasonable opportunities for detours around the sections of road to be renovated, it is expected that the road will remain passable throughout the construction period.

Construction Quality Control Testing will be performed by an independent and appropriately certified Laboratory in accordance with NDOT requirements.

All work is expected to be performed between March 2009 and September 2009.

Please provide the following with your response.

Provide a description of your firm?s experience to perform work as identified in our Statement of Work. Please show that you have a minimum of 5 years experience in work of a nature similar in type and magnitude to that set forth in the Statement of Work.

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), anticipates issuing a solicitation for proposals for design/build services to rehabilitate the Darunta Dam Hydroelectric Power Plant in Afghanistan. The power plant was constructed by Soviet Union (USSR) companies in the early 1960 and contains three vertical Kaplan (6 blade propeller) units with rated output of 3.85 MW each. The total electric power capacity is 11.5 MW. The plant is currently in very poor condition and requires major rehabilitation including possible replacement of all three turbines.

USAID intends to issue this solicitation with a performance based Statement of Objectives (SOO). USAID will advise proposers of project objectives and desired outcomes but will not specify exact equipment requirements or rehabilitation methods. Proposers will have the opportunity to propose innovative, cost effective solutions for the rehabilitation of the power plant. This solicitation will be accomplished using full and open competition and all interested parties are invited to propose. USAID especially encourages Afghan and/or regional contractors to consider this business opportunity.

<DESC>As part of its effort to improve public transit service for persons with disabilities, The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has awarded a grant to Sound Transit, in Seattle, Washington to install a regional, multimodal infrared way-finding system to aid sight-impaired customers.  The grant is authorized by a provision in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users SAFETEA-LU) that calls for a Remote Infrared Audible Signage (RIAS) Model Accessibility Project (MAP).   RIAS technology consists of transmitters sending audio signals by directional infrared light beams to handheld receivers that decode the signals and play the message through speakers or headsets. RIAS will be installed at approximately seven transit stations, as well as the crosswalks surrounding those transit stations, in the Puget Sound region (Seattle area).  Using the handheld receivers, persons with visual or cognitive disabilities will be able to navigate their way through the transit stations, identify approaching and departing transit vehicles, and hear walk and wait announcements at crosswalks. In support of the FTA, the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) is conducting the evaluation of RIAS MAP.  The evaluation will address the following effects of the RIAS deployment: (1) Effect on multimodal accessibility in public transportation with regard to persons with visual, cognitive, or learning disabilities; (2) Effect on public transportation operators and their customers; (3) Effect on making public transportation accessible to persons with visual, cognitive, or learning disabilities, who use public transit and paratransit; and (4) Effect on education, community integration, work life and general quality of life of the targeted populations.   To address the evaluation questions, the Volpe Center will conduct a panel study.  Pre and post surveys will be administered to a panel of study participants who use the technology during the course of their usual travels for a period of 6 to 8 weeks.  The surveys will be designed to assess the participants? experience with the technology and to determine the effects on multimodal accessibility.  The Volpe Center seeks sources that would be able to provide support in surveying a panel of study participants with visual, cognitive, or learning disabilities.   The survey firm will administer a pre-survey (by telephone) to the panel prior to their use of the technology.  Following a 6-8 week period where study participants use the technology, the survey firm will administer a post- telephone survey.   Among study participants with cognitive disabilities, qualitative in-person interviews may need to be conducted in place of the typical survey format, as this population may have difficulty completing a survey.  Support efforts will include, but are not necessarily limited to, the administration of the pre and post surveys and the maintenance of the panel over the course of the study.  Additional required support will include the administration of the pre- and post qualitative interviews, as well as the cleaning of the data and the delivery of a final dataset.  The Volpe Center will design the pre and post surveys and will conduct the data analysis.    The Volpe Center may also seek assistance in recruiting participants for the panel study.  This would involve working with Seattle area advocacy groups (such as Washington State Department of Services for the Blind and Lighthouse for the Blind) to obtain volunteers.  The sample should be balanced with respect to key demographic variables, such as gender, age, and education, and should include participants who vary in their frequency of using public transportation.   The Volpe Center is seeking sources with expertise (i.e., history of research experience) in conducting surveys, focus groups or qualitative interviews among those who are blind or cognitively disabled.  In particular, sources with a presence in the Seattle area are of particular interest.  Sources that have not worked with blind or cognitively impaired populations, but who have expertise in performing transportation research and have a presence in the Seattle area should also respond.   All capability information shall include: Customer (Government agency, private industry); contract value and type of contract; period of performance; and description of product/services. Information provided should be detailed in the area(s) above (i.e. history of research experience with visually or cognitively impaired populations) so the Government can assess the ability of the company to provide the described services. All of the information sought should be conveyed in no more than eight pages. Page size is set at 8 X 11 and text should be doubled spaced. Each response must reference the Sources Sought title. Interested parties must respond to this announcement in writing within 15 days of publication. Telephonic requests will not be honored. All responses must be sent to Karen Marino, Contracting Officer, RTV-6D2, United States Department of Transportation, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02142.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems command, Applied Aerodynamics and Store Separation Branch (AIR 4.3.2.1), Patuxent River, MD 20670 announces its intention to procure, on a competitive basis, the materials and services necessary for the following: upgrade of tunnel control system to a variable frequency drive, upgrade tunnel control and data acquisition computer(s) to control and acquire all existing facility instrumentation, procure and integrate a data post-processing computer(s) that will process data from all the various instruments, procure and integrate PCU (3 modules) upgrades to an PSI 8400 electronically scanned pressure system, procure and integrate a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system, and procure and integrate an unsteady, 5-hole, L-shaped, pressure probe system.   The procurement would include fabrication, installation, delivery, and technical support.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond, however, the Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  

INTRODUCTION:   

The purpose of the project is to acquire the latest model Particle Image Velocimetry system (PIV) and replace the current antiquated instrumentation computers tunnel drive system and with one or more computers to control all the instrumentation systems and wind tunnel drive. 

 Currently, three different computers using three different operating systems control various aspects of tunnel operation.  All computers are antiquated; the master control computer is a 486 PC.  The master computer experiences about 5% to 10% downtime during operation.  Upgrading the master computer is not possible as the tunnel drive/control software is incompatible with newer computers (and upgradeable software does not exist).  Additionally, all computers are operated as stand alone systems and are of limited memory and disk space.  It is becoming very difficult to single-handedly run the wind tunnel.  

The tunnel drive controller is antiquated and a failure would shut down the facility for an unacceptable length of time.  Additionally, the current drive components restrict the operating envelope to a minimum of 50 ft/s.  Low speed operation is impossible.  Wind tunnel corrections are difficult to adequately acquire due to the inability of the tunnel fan control to drive tunnel speed to 0 ft/s in a timely manner.  Test set-up, conduction, and data reduction/analysis is currently far from a turn-key operation.  Each test becomes a unique, in-efficient exercise.  Communication between the various systems is difficult at best (and with some systems impossible)

REQUIREMENTS:
The anticipated contract effort includes, but is not limited to the following:

The contractor shall be required to design, fabricate, procure, integrate, deliver, install, and provide training/support for a standardized and integrated wind tunnel control, data acquisition and post-processing system.  This system will consist of replacement of current wind tunnel drive control with a variable frequency drive/control that does not hinder, in any manner, current capability (including electronic noise levels) and is able to be remotely controlled from the facility control room, and integration of current instrumentation using standardized software to control, acquire and process data.  The contractor shall procure or manufacture a PIV system and an unsteady, 5-hole, L-shaped, pressure probe system and upgrade the PSI 8400 system PCU modules.  The contractor shall deliver, install, and insure operation of all components, and demonstrate integration of current facility instrumentation.  All computers must be able to easily pass data to each other.

The contractor shall have proven capability, compatibility, and knowledge of integrating wind tunnel control and data acquisition systems and instrumentation.

TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS:
The tunnel drive shall be of a low-noise, variable frequency type and able to control a 200 HP motor.  Tunnel control software/computers, henceforth referred to as the system,  must be able to control tunnel speed and acquire data from the various existing instruments.  The existing instruments are, but not limited to the following: 6-component strain gage balances with reference voltage sensing, pressure transducers, temperature probes, relative humidity probes.  Also, the system must be able to integrate, control and acquire data for an existing electronically scanned pressure system that contains approximately 200 channels of pressure data.  The system must be able to integrate, control and acquire data for an existing unsteady pressure data from a 32 channel, 100 kHz CAMAC system.  The system must be able to integrate, control and acquire data for an existing facility traverses.  The system must be able to integrate, control and acquire data for a to-be-procured PIV system.  The system must be able to integrate, control and acquire data for a to-be-procured an unsteady, 5-hole, L-shaped, pressure probe system.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a ball bar calibration machine that can calibrate the center to center length of ball bars used for laser tracker calibration.

NIST has a need for a ball bar calibration machine that would meet the following requirements:

1.	RANGE OF BALL BARS THAT CAN BE CALIBRATED ? The system must be able to calibrate ball bars with a minimum length of 300 mm; maximum length greater than 2800mm; minimum sphere size of 25 mm; and a maximum sphere size greater than 38 mm.

2.	LENGTH UNCERTAINTY - The expanded uncertainty (k equals 2) in a single measurement of the ball bar center to center length shall be no greater than 0.6 parts per million.

3.	SENSORS, INSTRUMENTATION AND SOFTWARE - The system must include a data acquisition card and an interferometer system along with an environmental compensation system that are compatible with the Renishaw Application Programming Interface (API) and Visual Basic. The system must use self-mastering techniques to establish the center to center length of ball bars calibrated with the system. That is, the system shall not rely on master ball bar artifacts to ensure traceability of measurements.

4.	AUTOMATION AND DRIVE SYSTEM - The system must be manually operated (no drive motors or servo system and\or computer controller).

5.	DOCUMENTATION - Full documentation of the uncertainty budget along with proof of the metrological traceability of measurements performed with the instrument to the SI unit of length.


NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 333314, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your company?s size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture ball bar measuring systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY:  Request for Information (RFI)<BR>TITLE:  Acoustic Gunshot Detector System<BR><BR>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for  proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have  been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications.  Interested parties are respo nsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. <BR><BR>The government is conducting market research to determine the status of currently available low cost mature commercial products capable of providing near real time 360 degree field of vision counter sniper situational aware ness for US troops and to improve detection and neutralization of sniper and other precision small arms fire threats. For purposes of this RFI, a mature solution would need to be classified at a Technology Readiness Level of at least 9, Integration Readine ss Level of 5 and a Manufacturing Readiness Level of 10. The system must be currently qualified, by a certified testing entity, in accordance with MIL-STD-461E Interface Standard Requirements for the Control of Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics of Subsystems and Equipment and MIL-STD-810F Environmental Testing (Shock, Vibration, Solar, and Sand). This capability is referred to as the Acoustic Gun Shot Detection System (AGDS).  Any AGDS configuration must be fully integrated with existing Vanguard  and Doubleshot (DS) systems that are currently being fielded by the Army. The AGDS software interface will have ASCII based over TCP connection to integrate to the Vanguard and the DS systems currently fielded. The AGDS hardware interface will be via an E thernet cable. Additionally, because AGDS will be installed on a variety of mobile ground based platforms such as HMMWV, MRAP and Stryker vehicles, the government is interested in the delivery of individual platform integration kits (IK) with a goal of lim iting the number of individual installation kits through the use of a universal vehicle integration and installation kits.  In addition to the AGDS and IKs, the government would have a need for initial spares, new equipment training (CONUS and OCONUS) and technical documentation.<BR><BR>Salient AGDS performance characteristics include the following:<BR><BR>1. Passive acoustic detection, computer-based signal processing, and both aural <BR>and visual indications to help troops locate the shooter, reporting r elative     shooter azimuth, range, and elevation from incoming small arms fire.<BR><BR>2. Operates when the vehicle is stationary or moving, using a single mast-mounted, compact array of microphone(s). <BR><BR>3. Detects small arms fire traveling toward t he vehicle for bullet trajectories passing within approximately 30 meters of the mast and shooters firing at maximum effective weapons ranges.<BR><BR>4. Isolate the shooter to a single location and in this scenario will provide a message identifying the sh ooters position relative to the AGDS Mast/Hub. <BR><BR>5. Detection is required in less than a second. <BR><BR>6. Prevent system false alarms caused by non-bal listic events such as road bumps, door slams, wind noise, tactical radio transmissions, and extraneous noise events (vehicle traffic, firecrackers, and urban activity). <BR><BR>7. Does not alert when shots are fired from the vehicle.<BR><BR>AGDS size, weig ht and power considerations include:<BR><BR>1. Operates on moving vehicles up to 60 mph, all terrains and environments (open field/urban)<BR> <BR>2. Detects shooter on first round fired under all environmental conditions (day/night/fog/rain/snow/sandstorm)  <BR><BR>3. User Outputs: Visual/Aural. Custom LED display of relative shooter azimuth, alphanumeric display, and integrated speaker. Military 10-digit grid coordinates displayed in standby mode. <BR><BR>4. Simple Operation: On/Off switch, no calibration r equirements <BR><BR>5. Built-in system diagnostics and Ethernet interface <BR><BR>6. Shot Detection: greater than 95 percent of supersonic projectiles <BR><BR>7. Bearing Accuracy Error: less than 2.5 degrees RMS <BR><BR>8. Range Accuracy Error: less than p lus or minus 15 percent <BR><BR>9. Elevation Accuracy Error: less than  2.5 degrees RMS/local tilt <BR><BR>10. Response Time: From detection of gunshot to information output: less then 1.5 sec.<BR><BR>11. Operation on moving vehicle: Up to 60 mph, all terr ains.<BR><BR>12. Size  Display: 7.25 inches wide x 4.75 inches high H x 3.25 inches deep <BR><BR>13. Size - Mast/Array; 3 feet long (approximately 7 feet high when installed) with 22 inch diameter array <BR><BR>14. Weight-Total System: less than 15 lbs. < BR><BR>15. Power: less than 25 Watts <BR><BR>16. Supply Voltage: 18-30 Vdc <BR><BR>17. Data Interface: Ethernet or USB <BR><BR>18. Operating Temperature Range: 0 degrees to 50 degrees Celcius <BR><BR>19. Shock/Vibration: MIL-STD-810F <BR><BR>20. System Cal ibration: None required, all microphone(s) replaceable (unmatched) <BR><BR>21. False Alarms: None due to wind noise, bumps, door slams <BR><BR>22. Return Fire Suppression: No alert from outgoing fire <BR><BR>23. System Diagnostics: Built-in test at boot up . Microphone test using standard whistle <BR><BR>24. Vehicle Installation: HMMWV,  less than 2 man hours<BR><BR>Depending on the results of this market research the government is contemplating award of a low rate initial production contract during which sy stem production, qualification and integration testing would be conducted on an accelerated basis over the course of 3-6 months.  This initial phase would be followed by a full rate production effort where it is envisioned that a quantity of up to 3000 act ive and 2500 inactive (decoy) would be delivered in less than a 12 month period.  Initial sparing is anticipated to be 5-10 percent of the total quantity of active systems and shall be delivered concurrently with each system lot. The objective production s chedule and ramp up for the active and decoy systems is:  100 each type 30 days after contract award (DAC); 240 each type 60 DAC; 480 each type 90 DAC; and 420 each subsequent month until the last delivery month.   <BR><BR>Interested parties should address  the above and provide the following information as part of their response to this RFI:   <BR><BR>Information submitted must be complete descriptions of existing products that will be available for delivery within the timeframe indicated above.  Industry m ust include sufficient documentation to support any claims that their system performance will meet the minimum performance capabilities contained herein. Limit documentation to include system technical specifications, performance test data, system drawings  and/or photographs, or any other data to support the state of system development and or production readiness; marketing information will not be accepted.  <BR><BR>All material submitted in response to this RFI must be unclassified.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Increase in Ceiling of contract EPR70513
<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE IS TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT OF FAR 5.207.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE.   
	
The ceiling of the contract shall be increased from $1,095,040 to $1,371,969 for two reasons.  One reason is to cover unanticipated, emergency repairs that were neither anticipated nor typical for the Line Scanner Equipment maintained under this contract.  The second reason is to cover costs associated with the construction of detector elements and dewar assemblies necessary to complete the Line Scanner Upgrade Project.
	
The Line Scanner and related equipment repairs and construction are crucial to the Airborne Spectral Photometry of Environmental Contaminants Technology (ASPECT) program and shall not be competed because the Agency would realize a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the Agency would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirement.  
	
The work shall be completed by LR Tech, Inc., 42 Chemin du Boise Lac Beauport, Quebec, Canada GOA 2C0 under EPA contract EPR70513.
	
All work completed under the increase in ceiling is within the scope of the statement of work of contract #EPR70513.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration intends to award a modification to contract number HSTS03-06-F-SEC040, with APPTIS, Inc.  Personal Security?s new database, the Integrated Security Information Management System (ISIMS) plays a major part of the adjudication process.  The ISIMS, Version II, is being developed under the competitively awarded HSTS03-06-F-SEC040 by Apptis and is scheduled to be released on March 31, 2008.  However, there are two critical components required to be in place concurrent with ISIMS? release of which without, would cause a significant delay and set-back for the ISIMS project.

The two components required are:

A.  Fingerprint Processing and Retention.   
B.  ISIMS Training Course and Certification Module

This is a one-time requirement to meet the ISIMS rollout of March 31, 2008.

The anticipated value of this modification is approximately $197,000.00.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 306-08-019 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The full solicitation document exceeds allowable character count for the Federal Business Opportunity Website. The information below is a summary of the solicitation. In order to provide a proposal, please request the full solicitation from the Point of Contact below. The offerors already pre-registered with USAID Regional Inspector General/Manila can receive the full solicitation. All non-US based offerors must be prequalified by USAID Regional Inspector General to be eligible for award under this solicitation. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-15.       

OBJECTIVE

The objective of the work is for an audit firm to conduct concurrent financial audits on the local costs (costs incurred and paid in Afghanistan) of LBGI/B&V Contract No. 306-I-00-06-00517 for the period from August 25, 2006, to August 24, 2011. The LBGI/B&V Contract implements USAID Afghanistan's Infrastructure Rehabilitation Program (AIRP). Concurrent audits shall be conducted on an annual basis with issuance of a separate audit report for each concurrent audit. The initial audit report will be for the period from August 25, 2006 through September 30, 2007. Subsequent reports will be done on annul basis. 

The Schedule of Local Costs Billed to USAID is the basic financial statement to be audited that presents LBGI/B&V's local costs billed to USAID, and the commodities and technical assistance directly procured by USAID for contractor's use, for the period audited.

The Auditor shall perform audits in accordance with the Statement of Work and U.S. Government Auditing Standards, and shall accordingly include such tests of the accounting records as deemed necessary under the circumstances. The specific objectives of the audit are to:

1.       Identify as unsupported or ineligible, any questioned costs in the Schedule of Local Costs Billed to USAID for the period audited in conformity with the terms of the contract/task order and generally accepted accounting principles or other comprehensive basis of accounting (including the cash receipts and disbursements basis and modifications of the cash basis).

2.       Evaluate and obtain a sufficient understanding of LBGI/B&V's internal controls related to the AIRP, assess control risk, and identify reportable conditions, including material internal control weaknesses.     

3.       Perform tests to determine whether LBGI/B&V complied, in all material respects, with contract/task order terms and applicable laws and regulations related with USAID-funded programs and projects. All material instances of noncompliance and all indications of illegal acts must be identified.     

4.       Determine if LBGI/B&V has taken adequate corrective action on prior audit report recommendations.

5.       Determine if LBGI/B&V has delivered, accounted for, and made proper disposition of commodities and supplies purchased under the Contract or task order, or furnished by USAID under the Contract or task order.

6.       Determine if LBGI/B&V has delivered technical assistance according to the Contract or task order.     

LBGI/B&V is responsible for the design and implementation of programs and controls to prevent and detect fraud. However, the Auditor must design audit steps and procedures in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and U.S. Government Auditing Standards to provide reasonable assurance of detecting situations or transactions in which irregularities or illegal acts have occurred or are likely to have occurred. If such evidence exists, the Auditor must contact the USAID Regional Inspector General (RIG) in Manila and must exercise due professional care in pursuing indications of possible irregularities and illegal acts so as not to interfere with potential future investigations, legal proceedings, or both.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)
Data Recovery
CSB-2008-03-I-FL (T2 Laboratories)

BACKGROUND:
The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) is an independent federal agency with the mission of ensuring the safety of workers and the public by preventing or minimizing the effects of chemical incidents at industrial facilities.  The CSB is a scientific investigation organization; it is not an enforcement or regulatory body.  Established by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the CSB is responsible for determining the probable causes of incidents, issuing safety recommendations, studying chemical safety issues, and evaluating the effectiveness of other government agencies involved with industrial chemical safety.  Section 112(r)(6)(G) of the Clean Air Act prohibits the use of any conclusions, findings, or recommendations of the CSB relating to any chemical incident from being admitted as evidence or used in any lawsuit arising out of any matter mentioned in an investigation report.  Congress modeled the CSB after the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigates aircraft and other transportation accidents for the purpose of improving safety.  Like the NTSB, the CSB makes public its actions and decisions through investigation reports, safety studies, safety recommendations, special technical publications, and statistical reviews.

On December 19, 2007, a reactive chemical incident including an explosion and subsequent fire occurred at the T2 Laboratories (T2) facility in Jacksonville, Florida.  The resulting explosion and fire killed four workers and injured dozens.

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this solicitation is to obtain the services of a computer forensics contractor capable of recovering hard drives damaged in a fire and imaging the hard drives for data recovery.

SCOPE:
Work will be performed at the contractor's facility.  Except where explicitly noted otherwise herein, the contractor is required to provide all equipment and materials necessary to perform the tasks set forth in this PWS.  Protocols developed by the contractor must be consistent with ASTM E860-97, "Standard Practices for Examining and Testing Items That Are or May Become Involved in Litigation."

The hard drives to be recovered are located in five computer CPUs collected from the T2 facility.  The CPUs show external signs of fire and water damage.  The CPUs appear to be PC-based machines.  The CSB believes that there are a total of 5 hard drives to be recovered, but the contents of the drives are unknown.

All information collected or created by the contractor will become part of the CSB case file for the investigation.  All written deliverables required by this PWS shall be in MS Word or other MS Office format.

The contractor shall provide deliverables and other documentation related to this contract only to the CSB Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).  The CSB reserves the right to provide copies of deliverables to the other parties to the joint Evidence Collection, Preservation, and Testing Agreement.  The contractor shall not provide copies of deliverables or any other documentation related to this order to any other party, unless directed in writing to do so by the COTR.

TASKS:
1. Prepare Detailed Protocol
The contractor shall prepare a detailed written protocol describing how each task set forth in this PWS shall be performed.  This detailed protocol is a separate and distinct document from the general protocol described above.

In describing how each task shall be performed, the protocol must address the following specific issues:

The means by which damaged hardware is recovered and repaired, including all generally accepted protocols for such work.  Among other matters, the protocol must describe how the contractor will remove the hard drive from its case and evaluate the drive's integrity.

The means by which data from damaged hardware is recovered and copied for future use.

No other tasks described in this PWS will take place until the COTR has inspected the protocol and determined that it meets the requirements of this PWS.  The contractor shall promptly correct any deficiencies identified by the COTR and incorporate the corrections into a revised protocol.

The CSB will then circulate the protocol to OSHA and T2 for comment.  If necessary, and as directed by the COTR, the contractor will also revise the protocol to address comments made by OSHA and/or T2.

2. Pick-up and Delivery
The computers are located in a portable storage locker located at the incident site in Jacksonville, Florida.  The contractor will work with the COTR to arrange a date and time at which access will be granted to the contractor to pick-up the computers.  The contractor is responsible for providing for the pick-up, packaging, shipping, and delivery of the computers to the contractor's facility.  The contractor must ensure that the computers are packed and shipped in a manner that protects against damage or alteration in transit.

The contractor's facility must provide a secure area in which the computers and hard drives can be stored, with access restricted to those contractor personnel who need to handle them to perform the work required by this contract.  While the CPUs and hard drives are in the possession of the contractor, it shall maintain a chain-of-custody log for all items from the time of initial pick-up until the time of their final release, as authorized by the COTR.

3. Recover Hardware
The contractor shall recover, and to the extent possible, repair the hard drive from each computer to the extent necessary to allow data recovery, in accordance with the protocol approved by the COTR.  If one or more of the hard drives cannot be repaired sufficiently to allow data recovery, the contractor must prepare and submit to the COTR a statement describing why the hard drive(s) cannot be repaired.

4. Recover Data
The contractor shall recover any and all data from each hard drive in accordance with the protocol approved by the COTR.  If data is not recoverable from one or more of the hard drives, the contractor must prepare and submit to the COTR a statement describing why the data could not be recovered.

CONFIDENTIALITY:
Upon award of the contract and before beginning any work, the contractor and its personnel shall sign a confidentiality agreement with the CSB.  The contractor, and any subcontractor, shall not communicate with any interested party in connection with this procurement without prior approval from the COTR.

CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY:
The Contracting Officer (CO) for this procurement will be an employee of the Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), the CSB's delegated procurement office.  In no event shall any understanding or agreement between the contractor and any government employee other than the appointed CO on any contract modifications, change orders, letter or verbal direction (other than direction within the scope of the COTR's authority) to the contractor be effective or binding upon the government.  All such actions must be formalized by the proper contract modification executed by the appointed CO.  The contractor is hereby put on notice in the event a government employee other than the CO directs a change in the work to be performed or increases the scope of work to be performed, it is the contractor's responsibility to make inquiry of the CO before making the deviation.

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP):
The COTR will summarize and document the Contractor's performance in the three categories listed below (evaluation based on meeting the requirements of this PWS and the contractor submitted Quality Assurance Plan): 
Quality of service
Business relations
Timeliness of performance 

Surveillance method.  Random Evaluation.  This method employs a "spot check" style of evaluation and may be adjusted, based on quality trends.  The Government retains the right to inspect all requirements of the contract. Unacceptable performance will be recorded and the Contractor shall be required to correct the unacceptable condition within a 24-hour time period.  If the Contractor does not correct the unacceptable condition within 24-hours, the COTR will notify the Contracting Officer who will take appropriate administrative action for unacceptable performance.  When an observation indicates defective performance, the COTR will require the Contractor to initial the observation.  The initialing of the observation does not constitute concurrence with the observation; it only indicates acknowledgement that the Contractor has been made aware of a potentially defective performance.

ADDITIONAL TERMS:
Performance under the order is subject to the following additional terms, which are hereby incorporated into the order:

Public Release of Information
Contractor shall submit any proposed public release of information pertaining to its work for the CSB to the General Counsel of the CSB for approval prior to release.  Contractor shall not release any such information without prior written approval from the CSB General Counsel.

Personnel Security Requirement
Contractor, Contractor personnel assigned to perform work for the CSB, and any subcontractor retained by Contractor shall execute a non-disclosure agreement as a condition for granting those individuals/entities access or potential access to trade secret and confidential business information.

Contractor Testimony
Contractor shall immediately report to the General Counsel of the CSB any and all requests for the testimony of Contractor, its personnel, and/or its subcontractors, and any intention to testify as a witness relating to:  (a) any work required by and/or performed for the CSB; (b) any information or data produced by Contractor in the course of its work for the CSB; or (c) any information provided by any individual or entity to assist Contractor in performing work for the CSB.  All requests for testimony of Contractor, its personnel, and/or its subcontractors that fall within the scope of 40 C.F.R. part 1611 shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of that regulation.

Organizational Conflicts of Interest
a. Contractor, its personnel, and any other person or entity performing work for Contractor on behalf of the CSB, shall execute a certification of non-conflict of interest.  Such executed certification constitutes the signatory's acknowledgement that he/she has read and understands the requirements of this clause and agrees to abide by its terms.
b. Contractor and its personnel performing work for the CSB under this order should not be placed in a conflicting role because of current or planned interests (whether financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise), which relate to the work performed under this order, nor should Contractor obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance under this order.
c. Contractor warrants that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or in the alternative, warrants that it has fully disclosed all such relevant information.  Additionally, during the period of performance under this order, Contractor agrees to forego entering into any other contractual arrangements with any firm or organization, the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest with respect to the work being performed under this order.  Contractor shall ensure that all agents, employees, and subcontractors retained for any purpose under this order abide by the provisions of this entire clause.  If Contractor has reason to believe, with respect to itself or any of its agents, employees, or subcontractors, that any proposed contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, Contractor shall obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB before the execution of such contractual arrangement.
d. Contractor further agrees that if, after it commences work for the CSB, it discovers organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this order, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB.  It is agreed that this disclosure will include a description of the action that Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate the conflicts.  Contractor shall continue performance until notified by the Contracting Officer of any contrary and/or supplemental action to be taken.
e. It is the specific responsibility of Contractor to ensure that any and all subcontractors, and any subcontractors' employees, are free from conflicts of interest.  Contractor warrants that no subcontractors already identified, or any of their subcontractors' employees, have an identifiable conflict of interest.  It is further agreed that, in the event a conflict of interest is discovered after award of the subcontract, the same rules for disclosure, and all of the same remedies open to the CSB, described below, remain binding.  Contractor further agrees to insert in each subcontract or agreement done in furtherance of this order, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this entire clause.
f. During the period of performance under this order, Contractor specifically agrees not to represent, assist, be employed by, or otherwise perform any services or functions for T2 Laboratories, Inc. (T2) or for T2's agents, insurers, or successors in interest (but only to the extent that work for such agents, insurers, or successors in interest would pertain to the December 19, 2007, incident at the T2 facility in Jacksonville, Florida); or for any other entity or individual that is the subject of an official CSB investigation.  Contractor also agrees not to represent, assist, be employed by, or otherwise perform any services or functions for T2 or for T2's agents, insurers, or successors in interest (but only to the extent that work for such agents, insurers, or successors in interest would pertain to the December 19, 2007, incident at the T2 facility in Jacksonville, Florida) for a period of 6 months after the end of the period of performance under this order.  Additionally, if Contractor performs work for the CSB under this order at the site of an official CSB investigation, Contractor agrees not to solicit work at that site from the entity or individual being investigated for a period of 6 months after the issuance of the final CSB report on that investigation.
g. Notwithstanding the immediately foregoing prohibitions, the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB may authorize Contractor to solicit or perform this general type of work if the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel determine that the situation will not pose a potential for bias or unfair competitive advantage, and they approve of the proposed solicitation or work.
h. For breach of any of the above restrictions, or for intentional nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant conflicts of interest required to be disclosed concerning this order, or for such erroneous representations that necessarily imply bad faith, the CSB may terminate the order for default, disqualify Contractor from subsequent contracts, and pursue other remedies permitted by law or this order.  Notwithstanding these remedies, however, the CSB may always terminate the order for convenience, in whole or in part, if termination is in the best interests of the government.

Proprietary Rights
Contractor agrees that all property rights, including publication rights, in any information and materials that are newly produced by the Contractor specifically for the CSB under this order shall vest in the government.  Information and materials shall include, but not be limited to:  progress reports, source data, plans, systems analyses, reports, extracts, test data, and procedures.  Contractor shall not publish any of the results of its work for the CSB under this order without the prior written approval of the General Counsel of the CSB.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)
LEGAL SUPPORT SERVICES
BACKGROUND
The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) is an independent federal agency with the mission of investigating chemical accidents and hazards and recommending actions to protect workers, the public, and the environment.  The CSB's scientific investigations bolster efforts by government, industry, labor, and communities to prevent chemical accidents.  The agency was created by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and was first funded and commenced operations in 1998.  The CSB's core mission activities include conducting accident investigations; formulating corrective or preventive recommendations based on investigation findings and advocating for their implementation; issuing reports containing the conclusions, findings, and recommendations arising from accident investigations; and conducting studies on chemical hazards.
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this acquisition is to obtain the services of a contractor that specializes in providing legal professional (attorneys) and para-professional (law clerks and paralegals) personnel on temporary basis.  The CSB OGC requires such personnel, on an as-needed basis, to work on critical projects and/or emergency assignments in support of its functions, as described above.  These projects/assignments will be of varying complexity and duration, lasting from a few days or a week up to a maximum of 240 workdays.
SCOPE
The contractor shall perform work in its own offices, at the CSB offices in downtown Washington, D.C., and as required to make short trips to off-site locations (e.g., law libraries) within Washington, D.C. and its immediate environs to perform tasks such as specialized legal research.
The contractor will perform the tasks set forth below:
Develop a procedure to receive and respond to requests from the CSB for temporary legal personnel for critical projects and emergency assignments.  This procedure will include, at a minimum:
A designated point-of-contact to receive all requests for temporary legal personnel
A designated, consistent method of receiving and responding to requests (e.g.:  facsimile, e-mail, etc.).
Upon receipt of a request for temporary legal personnel from OGC, provide the resumes of the three personnel most qualified to perform the work called for by the request.  The contractor will assess who is the most qualified by applying its expertise in staffing legal positions to match the proposed personnel training, skills, and experience with the work called for by the request and the qualifications requested by OGC.  The contractor must have the capacity to supply personnel with the requisite training, skills, and experience to successfully perform the following kinds of tasks:
Reviewing investigation files and applying statutory provisions and case law to identify and separate individual documents and records which may be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act from those documents and records which are not exempt from disclosure.
Reviewing investigation files and applying statutory provisions and case law to identify and segregate individual documents and records which may be subject to the Privacy Act or Trade Secrets Act.
Assisting in the preparation of responses to discovery requests in administrative and/or civil litigation by gathering documents and records, separating non-responsive materials from responsive materials, and packaging them for production.
Conducting research on issues of administrative law, federal procurement law, federal personnel law, and/or other areas of law (primarily federal); and summarizing and analyzing the results of such research in legal memoranda.
Conducting research and gathering primary sources in various areas of federal law for assembly into background resource materials for use by OGC attorneys.
Performing other tasks of a legal and/or substantive legal support nature, on projects/assignments arising out of the work of OGC, as described under "Background," above.
After OGC has determined that the proposed personnel are acceptable, provide that individual to OGC.  If none of the initially proposed personnel are determined acceptable, the contractor will provide additional resumes of proposed personnel to OGC until acceptable personnel are identified.
Individual service requests under this contract may require varying mixes of personnel.  Some requests may require only one person, while others may require more than one (e.g.:  two attorneys or one attorney and one law clerk).  It is also possible that multiple projects will be going on simultaneously, requiring separate groups of vendor-supplied personnel.  The vendor should have sufficient flexibility and an adequate personnel pool to meet these varied staffing needs.  If an OGC service request requires qualifications or experience not available in the contractor's current personnel pool, the contractor is responsible for supplementing its pool to satisfy the OGC request.  The contractor must be able to supply at least four temporaries simultaneously.
The use of personnel under this contract will not create an employer-employee relationship between the CSB and the contractor personnel.  The contractor is at all times the legally responsible employer of any personnel assigned to the CSB OGC under this contract.  The contractor - not the CSB - will recruit, test, hire, train, assign, pay, provide benefits and leave to, and as necessary, address performance problems, discipline, and terminate its employees.  Personnel supplied to the CSB OGC under this contract will not be considered Federal employees for any purpose, will not be regarded as performing a personal service, and will not be eligible for civil service employee benefits, including retirement.
The yearly labor mix estimates are best estimates based on historical data and usage.  These labor mixes can potentially change dramatically based on future events.  Please price accordingly.  
DELIVERABLES
The contractor is responsible for providing the CSB OGC with temporary legal professional and para-professional personnel in the following categories on an as needed basis:
Law Clerk - A law clerk is a currently enrolled student in an ABA-accredited law school who has completed at least the first year of a J.D. degree program.  Based upon the typical nature of OGC projects and historical experience, law clerks will be the most frequently requested personnel category under this order.  For the purposes of this order, OGC requires law clerks who can work full-time (30 - 40 hours/week) during the summer and part-time (10 - 20 hours/week) during the academic year.  To meet this requirement, the contractor must be able to provide law clerks who attend law school in the Washington, DC, area. Estimated 900 hours per year
Paralegal II - A paralegal in this category is an individual who provides substantive legal (as opposed to strictly clerical) support to attorneys.  Based upon the typical nature of OGC projects and historical experience, paralegals are the category least likely to be requested under this order.  For the purposes of this order, OGC requires individuals with at least one year of full time experience as a paralegal, and strongly prefers individuals who have completed at least a paralegal certificate program.  Estimated 20 hours per year
Attorney I - An attorney in this category is a graduate of a J.D. degree program at an ABA-accredited law school who is a member in good standing of the bar of any state or the District of Columbia, and who has 0 - 1 year of general work experience as an attorney.  The attorney must be able to work either full-time (30 - 40 hours/week) or part-time (10 - 20 hours/week).  Estimated 20 hours per year
Attorney II - An attorney in this category is a graduate of a J.D. degree program at an ABA-accredited law school who is a member in good standing of the bar of any state or the District of Columbia, and who has 2 - 3 years of litigation experience as an attorney.  The attorney must be able to work either full-time (30 - 40 hours/week) or part-time (10 - 20 hours/week).  Estimated 20 hours per year
Attorney III - An attorney in this category is a graduate of a J.D. degree program at an ABA-accredited law school who is a member in good standing of the bar of any state or the District of Columbia, and who has 3 - 5 years of work experience as an attorney in a specialized area of the law relevant to OGC's practice (e.g., Freedom of Information Act, federal procurement law, federal personnel law).  The attorney must be able to work either full-time (30 - 40 hours/week) or part-time (10 - 20 hours/week).  Estimated 20 hours per year
TIMETABLE
The contractor will send the resumes of the three most qualified personnel for a particular project/assignment to the CSB OGC Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) within 24 hours of receiving a request to do so.  After being notified of which of the proposed personnel OGC deems acceptable, the vendor will direct those personnel to report to the CSB offices as follows:
If notification received by contractor by noon on any business day - personnel must report at opening of business on the next business day. 
If notification received by contractor after noon on any business day - personnel must report at opening of business on the second business day.

52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items. (JAN 1999)
Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to be the best overall value to the government.  The government will consider awarding at a slightly higher price only to receive superior technical quality.  The Contracting Officer will use the technical merits of each proposal and the price to determine the successful offeror.  As technical merit becomes more equal, price may be the deciding factor.  As the price becomes more equal, technical merit may be the deciding factor.  The non-price factors as listed below, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  The technical evaluation team will determine the technical merits of each proposal and provide a written summary of the evaluation results to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer will determine what trade-off between technical merit and price promises the greatest value to the government.
The non-price portion of the proposal must not exceed 11 pages in total or the proposal will not be evaluated.  Vendor experience, 5 pages; Proposed Work Statement, 5 pages; References, 1 page.
Non-Price Evaluation Factors:
Vendor Experience:  The proposal shall describe, in no more five (5) pages, the following areas of the prospective vendor's experience:
The specialized experience of the offeror and its key personnel in creating and maintaining a pool of, and providing for assignment, legal professional (attorneys) and para-professional (law clerks and paralegals) temporary personnel in the Washington, DC, legal market.  This area of the proposals will be evaluated based upon the extent to which they demonstrate such specialized experience; that is, proposals that demonstrate significant specialized experience in legal temporary staffing in the Washington, DC, legal market will receive higher scores than proposals that demonstrate limited or tangential experience in legal temporary staffing in the Washington, DC, legal market.
The offeror's experience in providing temporary legal personnel to Federal agencies.  This area of the proposals will be evaluated based upon the extent to which they demonstrate such experience; that is, proposals that demonstrate significant experience in providing temporary legal personnel to Federal agencies will receive higher scores than proposals that demonstrate limited or no experience in doing so.
The offeror's specific record of ability to maintain a pool of well qualified law students available for temporary assignments as law clerks.  This area of the proposals will be evaluated based upon the quality of the vendor's record of such ability; that is, proposals that demonstrate a consistent ability to maintain a pool of well qualified law students available for temporary assignments as law clerks will receive higher scores than proposals that demonstrate a limited or inconsistent ability in this regard.
Proposed Work Statement:  The proposal shall contain an explanation of no longer than five (5) pages of how the offeror proposes to accomplish the tasks set forth in the CSB PWS and PRS.  Specifically, the explanation should address, and will be evaluated based upon, the depth and sources of the offeror's legal personnel pool - especially law students - and the offeror's ability to provide attorneys, law clerks, and paralegals who are well qualified to perform the kinds of legal assignments described in the CSB PWS and PRS.  Proposed explanations that demonstrate a deep personnel pool from reliable sources, a steady supply of law students, and a convincing ability to provide attorneys, law clerks, and paralegals who are well qualified to perform the kinds of legal assignments described in the CSB PWS and PRS will receive higher scores than those that show a shallow and/or unreliable personnel pool, inconsistent supply of law students, and questionable ability to provide personnel well qualified to perform the work required by the CSB.
Past Performance:  The proposal shall provide three (3) references, preferably from Federal agencies, for other contracts to provide temporary legal personnel.  A contact name, telephone number, e-mail address, project title, and date the services were performed must be provided for each reference.  Reference responses will be evaluated based upon the timeliness (i.e., degree to which the offeror promptly responded to and fulfilled client service requests), quality (i.e., degree to which temporary personnel satisfactorily performed their assignments), responsiveness (i.e., degree to which offeror accommodated client requirements), and relevance (i.e., degree to which the offeror's prior work is similar to that described in the CSB PWS and PRS.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix for Custom Gene Chip Design, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Submit offers on NOI-RML-8009. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-25 dated 02/28/08. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541711 and the small business size is 500. SCHEDULE: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human zoonotic pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing a Staphylococcus aureus genome will assist towards achieving those goals. . The chips will be high density,  at 106 per cm2 or greater (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip? will be made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip? probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip? probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the genome custom GeneChip? probe array will be based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and will be able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The genome custom GeneChip? probe array will be housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.

Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
External Customer Acquisition Division, SSMC4 -Room 7601/0FA61 1305 East West Highway, 7th Floor, Silver Spring, MD, 20910, UNITED STATES

Purpose:

Maintain an immediate travel trade benchmark for travel demand, bookings, identify barriers to travel and, identify key actions to increasing travel.  Effort should focus on key in-country travel trade that sell and promote travel to the United States -- essential partners in U.S. exports.

Maintain said system immediately in order to establish current benchmarks, by utilizing the existing highly effective Travel Barometer program.

Continue partnership with Commercial Service as the in-country liaison, and the respective Visit USA committees for program input and recommendations which is critical to the success of the program.  (Utilize the proven success in the UK, currently in operation)

Ensure the system continues to operate comparably across all key markets identified by the USDOC international travel and tourism marketing and promotion campaign (UK).

Introduction:

 The National Oceanic& Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA), International Trade Administration (ITA), Office of Travel & Tourism Industries (OTTI) intend to utilize the Travel Barometer Survey Program, United Kingdom, using FAR 12 procedures for the period April 1, 2008 thru March 31, 2009.   This acquisition is being procured as a sole source using Other Than Full and Open Competition, in accordance with 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541910 and the related size standard is $6.5M.

Description:

A Departmental Administrative Order in April 1996 established the Office of Travel and OTTI within Manufacturing and Services of the International Trade Administration (ITA/MAS/S/OTTI).  Our mission is to:  work with the public sector and private industry to build American jobs through tourism exports.  OTTI's goal is to:  increase the number of tourism exporters by providing research and fostering economic development opportunities.  To accomplish the mission and goals, OTTI conducts research, provides technical outreach and implements policy.

In 2008, the U.S. Department Commerce funded DiscoverAmerica.com web site will be launched in the United Kingdom as a primary country.  The Barometer will have pre and post metrics on the new marketing initiative.

In 2008, the DiscoverAmerica.com will also be launched in Germany, Mexico, Canada, and Japan.  The overall Barometer program will server as a vital tool to track the penetration and success of this initiative in four of the five top countries for international travel to the United States.
                                 
OTTI will directly benefit from the German, Mexico, and Canada programs by only investing in the UK program.  The Barometer plays a critical role in establishing and tracking the impact of U.S. entry and exit polices.  The Barometer results have been used to establish critical metrics in past years and will continue to be a primary tool for monitoring implementation of U.S. entry policies.

OTTI will rely on the Barometer results to establish reliable forecasts in the United Kingdom, and the other key markets that the Barometer is conducted.

The Travel Barometer program exemplifies the US DOC's ability to monitor marketing and policy efforts at the national and destination level in a cost effective, timely, and partnership oriented system.  A key ingredient is the partnership between OTTI, the Commercial Service, the Visit USA committee's, and key in-country travel trade that sell and promote travel to the United States.

Task Order Title: 	United Kingdom

OTTI is seeking to continue and enhance the existing Travel Barometer system.  In the initial funding for the Travel Barometer program system was required to be expandable to accommodate the following market:

United Kingdom (Barometer system already in place)-the United Kingdom has special circumstances to follow-up on the recent U.S. promotional campaign.  This requires added development and survey analysis on an "as needed basis" for the Department of Commerce and the Advisory Board for the promotional campaign.  The added service is required for all survey sessions.

Currently the Travel Barometer gathers consistent input from in-market travel trade on current market indicators and provide this information to U.S. destinations and businesses interested in understanding market changes and expanding export investments.

Interested parties who believe they can provide the Travel Barometer Survey Program must submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating their technical capabilities. To be considered an affirmative response, all responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements. In your response you must address each of the items listed above in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit documentation will result in the agency proceeding as stated above. A determination by the agency not to open competition is solely within the discretion of the agency. In accordance with FAR 5.203(a), a written affirmative response must be received no later than 3 days after the publication of this synopsis (12:00 pm EST Wednesday). Please submit response to Annita.L.Wimbish@noaa.gov.

<DESC><br> <br>The United States ARMY JM&L LCMC is planning a sole source award <br>to Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace of Kongsberg, Norway. Army transformation <br>policy requires that training systems be developed to support operational <br>and institutional, home station, Combat Training Center, and deployed <br>units in the safe operation and maintenance of the CROWS system. This <br>procurement would provide delivery of Training Aids, Devices, Simulators <br>and Simulations (TADSS) equipment, training equipment installation, and setup <br>for 10 sets of Kongsberg Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station (CROWS) <br>Desktop Training Systems. <br> <br>There are no known alternative sources available for the CROWS training <br>devices that can develop a simulation program that mirrors Kongsberg's <br>CROWS user interface and functionality because of the proprietary nature <br>of Kongsberg's CROWS software and hardware. Kongsberg is the only source <br>available to meet the government training requirements for this CROWS. <br> <br>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed <br>contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within <br>the discretion of the Government. This notice of intent is not a <br>request for competitive proposals. The anticipated award date for <br>this action is 28 April 2008. <br> <br>See number note 22 <br>

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a Limited Source Justification. I recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of yearly cell phone subscriptions for instruments used for the International Simulcast Recall Program. The estimated cost is $75,023.00. 2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  Yearly subscription renewal for 335 VIKING cell phone devices is $49,915.00 at a subscription price of $149.00 per device. Yearly subscription renewal for 62 O2 cell phone devices is $6,138.00 at a subscription price of $99.0 per device. The yearly airtime charges for 397 (VIKING & O2) cell phone devices, is estimated at $3,970.00 for a subscription price of $10.00 per device. Annual Service and Maintenance Agreement for 397 devices is $15,000.00.  3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value).  The International Simulcast Recall Program uses cell phones to notify IPCs at post of high precedence messages received by the MSMC and BMC Relays. 4.	Identification of the justification rationale (see 8.405-6(a) and (b)) and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractors unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.  Statutory authority 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.  Only two responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 5.	A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d). A demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited (for sole source acquisitions; also required for unusual and compelling urgency where more than one offer will not be solicited).   World Cell Inc. and Nextel are the only sources that currently maintain GSM contracts in countries worldwide that provide services for more than 250 posts.  World Cell Inc. also has carriers in Reykjavik, Iceland dedicated to providing SMS services to countries with GSM coverage worldwide.<BR><BR>6.	A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. The description should include whether a FedBizOps notice was or will be publicized, as required by FAR 5.2, and if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies (e.g., blanket waiver provided in DOSAR 605.202-70).  BMC conducted surveys at the start of this program before cell phone acquisitions and program software were acquired.  World Cell Inc. and Nextel were the only venders that acquired GSM coverage contracts overseas. We use Nextel and World Cell Inc. for this program.  Nextels GSM overseas coverage has fallen off over the past 5 years while World Cells coverage has increased. Our Nextel phones have been substituted with World Cell instruments where required. Other vendors do not meet our current requirements and would be financially unacceptable. 7.	Any other facts supporting the justification.  The requirements for this program are unique. The International Simulcast Recall System is comprised of a software driven simulcast command and control station with direct connection, through the cell phone vendors lease line/satellite gateway, to quad-band Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) cell phones with worldwide roaming capability. The software driven simulcast command and control stations are located at BMC and MSMC. Using menu driven software scripts, the station allows operations personnel to create a database containing various notification and recall scripts that can be used to issue immediate notifications to post communications personnel throughout the world instantaneously. Notification messages issued by the control station are sent through the vendors lease line/satellite gateway and activate cell phones assigned to the post communicator personnel. The cell phones receive calls/signals through two major international GSM wireless providers  World Cell, and Nextel. These two providers were determined to be the best to effectively service the 250 posts being provisioned with the international simulcast recall capability. GSM is the worldwide standard communication with over 500 million subscribers. Approximately 70% of all subscribers in the world use GSM. GSM is in 162 countries with 423 providers, the largest wireless platform in the world. The GSM cell phone equipment, operates in the worldwide roaming frequency.  The products activated by leased line gateway service or satellite gateway with simulcast (send out multiple signals at the same time) capabilities, with text and numeric messaging. No other sources have expressed interest in writing or other wise for this acquisition.  Since its inception in 2002 the acquisition for this program have been limited (sole source) to World Cell and Nextel.<BR><BR>8.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.  Since no other venders meet the necessary requirements, actions by the agency to remove barriers to competition should not be necessary<BR><BR>

C-ARCHITECT-ENGINEER SERVICES SOLICITATION # GS-07P-08-HHD-0050
REGION:  Multiple Zones
CONTRACTING OFFICER: Anthony Kemp
PHONE NUMBER:  817 978-2684
PROJECT: New Construction & Repair and Alterations
PROJECT TYPE:   Various
CLIENT AGENCY: Department of Homeland Security
SIZE: BUDGET: Varied
GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:  
Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to plan and design new or expanded Federal facilities as well as repair and alterations of facilities to provide outstanding quality, value and operational design.  Projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for Federal employees.
In this context, The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Services for Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements and the facility will be designed in metric units. All new facility designs will be LEED certified, and shall be designed to meet the Silver standard as defined in the U.S. Green Buildings Council in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System to the extent the budget allows. 

Projects will be varied, including renovations, expansions or new facilities.  Expedited design and delivery approaches will be promoted, including prototype design, prefabricated and modular construction, and use of pre-designed components.  Thought should be given to the most appropriate and cost effective construction materials; and design, construction, and delivery methods suitable to the project.  Various project delivery methods, including traditional design and construction, and bridging-design-build, will be used. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a solicitation for A/E services for a period of one year with four additional one-year option periods.  Firms are not required to be geographically located in the State where the project is located, and are not required to have an active design production office within the State to be considered for award; however, successful A/E firms will be required to be licensed/registered within the State prior to the award of task order for a specific project and shall conform to all laws, rules, and requirements of that state governing the profession of architecture or engineering.  One or more awards are expected to be made for each of the primary services areas (zones) as follows:  
Zone 1: California, Arizona, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Alaska
Zone 2:  New Mexico and Texas
Zone 3:  North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine.
GSA anticipates three (3) awards for ZoneI; One (1) award for Zone II; and five (5) awards for Zone III.
Secondary service areas will include the contiguous United States.
The selected A/E firm shall primarily provide design services, including feasibility studies, bridging documents (35% construction documents), and full design and construction services, and research and reports related to the design of Federal facilities.  The final designs may be operationally complex and technologically sophisticated site and civil-intensive projects with a balance between aesthetic, functional, and security issues, including state-of-the-art data and telecommunications systems, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and other requirements.  Awardees under this requirement will not be eligible for award (individually or as a team member) on any design build projects resulting from work under any contract awarded under this requirement.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services may require: problem analysis, feasibility studies, energy analysis, life cycle costing, building information modeling, surveys, site and existing conditions surveys, design, planning, interior design, traffic and civil engineering, and estimating services for new construction, and repair and alteration projects. At times the contract may also require selected firms to provide civil engineering, boundary and topographical surveying, sustainable design, environmental studies, quality control testing, asbestos sampling/hazard assessment/ abatement design, historic structure reports, building evaluation reports, scope development, construction management, and other architectural, engineering and technical services. New construction may be up to approximately 50% site work and require extensive civil, traffic, environmental, signage and environmental graphics, as well as primarily architectural, landscape architectural, interior design, mechanical, electrical, structural services, and cost estimating, but may also necessitate geotechnical, fire safety, elevator, acoustical, lighting, historic preservation, construction management/inspection, surveyor and other disciplines with specialized experience. The selected A/E firms may be required to provide design services that include alternative energy, prefabrication or modular construction, and/or expedited design and delivery solutions.  The selected A/E firms may be required to participate in peer review processes. A/E?s may be required to develop prototypical designs, and the Government reserves the right to go back to the architects to modify and site adapt for any and all locations throughout the life of the contract.  All facilities will be designed in metric units. There will be no limit on the amount paid on individual delivery orders and no limit on project size; however the total cumulative delivery order amount shall not exceed $12 million in any one contract period, and the minimum guaranteed contract amount is $1000 for the base year and each of the option years, if exercised. Firm-fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts will result from this solicitation, including profit, overhead and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines and for use in negotiating firm-fixed price delivery orders. A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing delivery orders design services for projects with an estimate construction cost of less than $2 million will be included in the contract.  All design services will be in accordance with GSA requirements, design guides, and standards.  The design of new and renovation projects at ports of entry is an example of the design programs GSA anticipates ordering under this contract.

1.0	BACKGROUND

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  In November 2001, the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) formed the National Targeting Center (NTC) in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on America. It is the preeminent anti-terrorism facility for the Department of Homeland Security.  Originally started with 26 employees, it has now grown to more than 90 full time employees.  The NTC is a 24 hour, 7 day operation. It?s purpose is to provide proactive targeting aimed to prevent acts of terror, to seize, deter and disrupt terrorists, implements of terror, and to destroy the terror infrastructure. In April of 2007, the National Targeting Center Passenger (NTCP) and the National Targeting Center Cargo (NTCC) were established.  The NTCP operates in both a secure and non-secure environment. The NTCP generates targets based upon the results of research that it initiates. The NTCP focus is upon tactical information from which it generates actionable targets. The NTCP is composed of a dedicated staff of Watch Commanders and Target Analysts (TA) representing the CBP air, land and sea environments. These experts are multi-disciplined and are skilled at targeting inbound and outbound passengers and conveyances. 

Pursuant to the Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD)-6 and 11, it was mandated to integrate and maintain accurate and current information on all known or suspected terrorists, which resulted in the establishment of the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC).  The TSC, administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is a multi-agency effort where watch lists were consolidated into a single terrorist screening database (TSDB) to support all law enforcement measures of intelligence gathering and analysis on terrorists and their activities, and to ensure secure effective and timely interagency information sharing.   

The TSC-TSDB maintains these watchlists and accepts nominations of those individuals encountered that have not yet been watchlisted.  Although any agency can nominate an international terrorist for watchlisting, CBP-NTC routinely is the medium used for CBP Field Operations in the watchlist nomination process.




2.0	SCOPE OF WORK

The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide the Target Analysts at the National Targeting Center an online Fundamental Watch Listing Course.  The course will supply the TAs with a thorough understanding of the methodology for preventing attacks against the Homeland through the watchlisting process.  The course will meet the following objectives:

?	Provide a general description and overview of the watchlisting mission

?	Describe the international partnerships in watchlisting


?	Explain the relevant national policies affecting the practice of watchlisting

?	Provide an outline for watchlisting and the three level interdiction process


?	Identify key watchlisting databases and knowledge management tools

?	Describe the history of watchlisting and the changes in the watchlisting processes made in response to the 9/11 attacks


?	Identify who can nominate, the key parts of a watchlist nomination and the definition of ?good? biographical data.

?	Describe the main challenges/common criticisms of the watchlisting mission, to include the effect on privacy and civil liberties.


?	Identify the U. S. Agency watchlists currently integrated into the national-level watchlisting process


The course shall contain information, readings, case studies, discussions, and assignments that reinforce the learning objectives.  

Due to the work demands on the NTC employees, the course shall be offered in an online environment.  This allows the maximum flexibility for individuals to complete the course at their own pace and setting.  

In order to meet the objectives, the course will provide case studies and discussions to support a thorough understanding of the benefits of the watchlist program.

A course facilitator shall be made available to assist with case study assignments, discussion assignments, and any other support required to aid with the successful completion of the course.



2.1	Period Of Performance
The course shall be made available from the placement of this order for a period of one year. Analysts shall be able to initiate training at their convenience with a target completion within 30 days of training launch. 

2.2	Place of Performance
Although offered as an online effort, the primary place of performance for this effort is the National Targeting Center in Reston, VA.

2.3	Quantity of online Sessions
The provider shall make a maximum of 70 online sessions available for Target Analyst training.  



3.0	GENERAL INFORMATION

3.1	Sensitive Material
Due to the online nature of the course, the use of sensitive material is not permitted.

3.2	Use of examples and case studies
The provider shall provide case studies and examples that are pertinent to the course objectives and as current as possible.

3.3	Contractor Furnished Material
None shall be required as the training is all on-line.


3.4	Government Furnished Property
The Government is responsible for providing the equipment for students to access the online training.
