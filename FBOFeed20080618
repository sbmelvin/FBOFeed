The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

(local time) except for Federal Holidays.  Deliveries will be accepted on regular scheduled work days between 7:00 A.M. and 4:30 P.M. (local time).

A firm may file an agency protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agencys protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest.  Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies.
(3)	The ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the ELAP Program.  Should the interested party disagree with the ACA's resolution of an ELAP protest, it may utilize another protest forum without prejudice.  The ELAP Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protesters right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action.  In return for the protesters initially filing its protest as an ELAP instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the ELAP decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start.  This means that in an ELAP protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO.  Nothing in this clause adversely affects an interested partys rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action.

(d)	An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this clause for resolution of protests, or, with the ACA Chief Counsel at HQ, ACA at, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041-3201. 
(e)	For the purpose of filing an ELAP protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.  The ACA Chief Counsel is the ELAP Protest Decision Authority.  
(f)	An ELAP protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief.  All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an ACA Executive-Level Agency Protest.
(g)	Executive-Level Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from (Eric Vokt US ARMY DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY DIRECTORATE OF CONTRACTING SFCA-NR-DW MS#1 5330 VALDEZ CIRCLE DUGWAY, UTAH 84022-5001).<BR><BR>Access to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) requires that Contractor employees voluntarily submit personal data (e.g., name, social security number, etc.) when applying for a DPG Identification Card or temporary access pass.  This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks.  Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.
Delays caused by any adverse employee information do not constitute a basis for claim by the Contractor.  It is the Contractors responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds.<BR><BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with.<BR><BR>ARMY CONTRACTING AGENCY EXECUTIVE LEVEL AGENCY PROTEST PROGRAM. (APR 2004)
(a)	This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103.  An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed.  A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA.
(b)	An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following:
(1)	A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.
(2)	The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.
(3)	An award or proposed award of the contract.
(4)	A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.(c)	Voluntary Automatic Stay.  This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4).(1)	In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest.  This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay).  However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden.  This is known as an automatic stay override.<BR><BR>ACRONYM (MEANING): FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation), DFARS (DoD FAR supplement), CLIN (Contract Line Item Number), SUB-CLIN or SLIN (Contract Subline Item Number), OSHA (Occupational Safety Health Act), FOB (Free-on-Board), PCO (Procuring Contracting Officer), CFR (Code of Federal Regulations), LSA (Labor Surplus Area), SF (Standard Form), DD/DOD (Department of Defense), NSP (Not Separately)Priced<BR><BR>The Federal Supply Class (FSC) is (7010).

This software has provided the developers, testers and managers the ability to control change more efficiently, effectively, and with greater proficiency.  This purchase is for the maintenance renewal of the software product. This action is taken in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.

MKS was less labor intensive and easier to implement due to the user friendly administrative functionality of the tool.  Other tools required additional hardware and dedicated administrative personnel.<BR><BR>

The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 SMART servers, along with these other components, have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure.IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed. Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs.Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost. <BR><BR>Required Hewlett Packard DL380G5, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4, servers, and related infrastructure equipment (described above and in the attached) are required for SMART. These servers have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.   This acquisition will be advertised on FedBid, a reverse auction site.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>The objective of this notice is to identify small business contractors interested and capable of providing the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) support services for its National Transit Database (NTD) program. The NTD is the primary source of statistics on the transit industry in the U.S. The NTD collects detailed financial, operational, and capital asset data each year from over 650 transit providers in urbanized areas across the Nation, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Each month, these transit providers also report data on ridership, service operations, and safety and security to the NTD. Additionally, State, Territorial, and Tribal Departments of Transportation report data on behalf of over 1,400 transit providers in rural areas. Under 49 USC 5335 [Title 49, United States Code, Section 5335], which establishes the National Transit Database, all recipients of FTA Formula Grants under 49 USC 5307 (Urbanized Area Formula Grants) and under 49 USC 5311 (Formula Grants for Other Than Urbanized Areas) must report to the NTD. A number of transit providers in urbanized areas also report voluntarily to the NTD in order to benefit their local urbanized area in the apportionment of Urbanized Area Formula Grants. The contractor, through the use of subject matter experts, shall be responsible for effectively managing the NTD processes of collecting data from the required sources, providing technical assistance on the data requirements to reporters, validating the data collected, analyzing the data, and publicizing findings and results. The contractor must be able to develop revisions to NTD systems, software, validation procedures, and Manuals for the upcoming year, while beginning data collection for the current year, and while completing validation for data from the previous year. A "draft "statement of work (SOW) is provided.
<p>A sources sought notice, solicitation number DTFT60-08-R-00NTD, was posted on May 21, 2008. This pre-solicitation number DTFT60-08-R-00022 replaces the sources sought solicitation number DTFT60-08-R-00NTD. A presolicitation conference is not contemplated. All small business concerns that are able to provide the services described above, are encouraged to compete. All identified sources will be added to the solicitation mailing list and notified when the agency synopsizes the requirement in the Government Point of Entry (GPE). Anticipated solicitation issuance date is early July.</p>

<SUBJECT>Manufacturing of Lot Release Support Panel
<SOLNBR>FDA-SOL-08-00714
<CONTACT>Patricia Wright, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-827-7217, Fax 301-827-7101, Email patricia.wright@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking proposals for a contractor to fulfill a requirement for a program titled:  Manufacturing of Lot Release Support Panel.  FDA anticipates an award of a single cost reimbursement completion type contract with a maximum term of 5 years.  FDA intends to solicit this requirement as a full and open competitive requirement.  The FDA conducts lot release of in vitro diagnostic test kits developed by independent manufacturers for use in screening blood and blood products.  The lot release process confirms the adequacy of each lot’s test performance using panels of specimens specifically selected and formulated to characterize the limits of test performance.  Once potential samples have been identified, FDA has a need for service functions related to preparation, sterility, characterization, storage and possibly dissemination of panels.

The potential offeror shall receive, store, aliquot, transport and distribute infectious and non-infectious biological materials.  The FDA will need 2-3 panels made each year for a 5 year period of performance containing 5 to 10 members, with about 3,000 vials of each member.   Samples for each panel will be provided by the FDA, or may need help from the contractor in acquiring and/or purchasing candidate samples for panel production.

The solicitation will be available for download on or about July 3, 2008 and may be accessed through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.   No hardcopies will be distributed. Any questions concerning this requirement must be submitted in writing by e-mail only, to Patricia Wright at patricia.wright@fda.hhs.gov.  NO PHONES WILL BE ACCEPTED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.

<SUBJECT>High Throughput Sampler (HTS) for Canto I Cytometer
<SOLNBR>NCI-80100-MM
<RESPDATE>070208
<CONTACT>Melissa P Marino, Phone 301-402-4509, Fax 301-402-4513, Email marinome@mail.nih.gov - Caren N Rasmussen, Lead Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email cr214i@nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis for a High Throughput Sampler (HTS) for a Canto I Cytometer with BD Biosciences 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA 95131</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.106-(b)(1)  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The HTS allows one to run a 96-well plate, saving time by eliminating the laborious task of running individual tubes.  This contract will allow the installation of an up-grade, to an already existing unit, the Canto I. The HTS Unit must fit the exact hardware of the Canto I, if it is to run properly. With it, the Surgery Branch will be able to process more samples, in a shorter amount of time.  Such efficiency hastens Surgery Branch's quest for a cure to aggressive melanoma and other cancer modalities.</p>
<p>PART II. Facts and Reasons To Justify Other than Full And Open Competition</p>
<p>1.	Statute: 13.106-1 (b)(1)</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p><br />2.	Sole Source Justification</p>
<p>The new BD High Throughput Sampler (HTS) provides fully automated and rapid    sample acquisition.  It is designed to run a microtiter plate in 15 minutes (based on 2-sec acquisition in HT mode) with the sample carryover tolerances of 1% or less. The BD HTS adapts to the BD FACSCanto flow cytometer (our Canto I) within a few hours, making it fully modular.  No other known vendor manufactures such a unit compatible with NCI's existing Cytometer.  The purchase of an HTS from another manufacturer would void NCI's current service contract with BD Biosciences, rendering the equipment useless within a short period of time.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on July 2, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80100-MM on all correspondence.</p>

<CONTACT>Scott Segesdy, Contract Specialist, Phone (301)757-7098, Fax (301)757-7054, Email scott.segesdy@navy.mil
<DESC>In early 2007, a test effort was completed to identify the safe life of the F/A 18E/F pre Lot 30 Cost Reduction Initiative wing configuration (ECP 6058) at the tip launcher forward and aft attach areas of the wing tip structure.  A fatigue test of the tip launcher forward and aft local attach areas was conducted using the outer wing portion of the F/A 18E/F test article designated FT77.

Testing was conducted using a fatigue spectrum based on the F/A-18E/F “Hybrid” Master Event Spectrum.  This hybrid spectrum was created for use with E/F Verification 3 flight maneuver loads, the E3 dynamic loads, and the EA 18G ground event loads that reflect the flexible wing response.  Initially, the tip launcher forward attach was subjected to spectrum fatigue cycling for 11,000 simulated flight hours (SFH).  Subsequently, an additional 3,000 SFH of cycling with increased ground loads was applied to the launcher forward attach in order to impart additional damage due to CVS load factor based on E3 correlated loads.  Upon completion of launcher forward attach cycling, the launcher aft attach was subjected to spectrum fatigue cycling for 8,000 SFH.  The test effort revealed one retrofitable deficiency (crack) at a fastener hole (reference ECP 6309) and demonstrated a safe life of at least 6,000 hours at all other tip launcher areas of interest.

The USN has recognized a need to fly the F/A-18E/F beyond the original design 6,000 hour service life and has contracted Boeing to perform aircraft life assessment activities under the F/A 18E/F Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP).  A test demonstrated extension of the safe life of the ECP 6058 wing tip launcher attach structure has been identified as a valuable activity to be completed as part of the SLAP.

The objective of this SOW is to apply additional fatigue test cycles to the ECP 6058 wing tip launcher attach structure.  The USN has interest in fatigue cycling the test article until either a detectable crack initiates in one of the “hotspot” areas of interest or the USN elects to end testing.  Baseline testing per this SOW will require the application of one lifetime of fatigue cycles at the launcher forward and aft attach locations.  Completion of activities defined by the baseline SOW will raise the total number of fatigue test cycles demonstrated on the test article to three test lifetimes.  The USN may request additional test lifetimes be applied to the test article via the exercise of options to this baseline SOW.

The Naval Air Systems Command intends to place a sole-source cost plus fixed fee order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-05-G-0026 with McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) (A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company) of St. Louis, Missouri 63166.  Period of performance is 1 August 2008 through 31 December 2009.  MDC is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer and integrator of the F/A-18E/F aircraft in its various configurations and is the only source with the knowledge, expertise, facilities, and qualified personnel necessary to accomplish this effort.  Any interested party must have the knowledge, expertise, facilities, and qualified personnel necessary accomplish this effort within schedule requirements.  Any respondent must also submit a Statement of Qualifications to demonstrate respondent’s ability to perform to the Government’s needs within the required response time.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only.

MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: The Government is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey for a 40 MM standoff door breaching round.  Potential 40 mm standoff door breaching candidate rounds should be compatible with the following characteristics.  1) Weapon System  The candidate rounds must be compatible with the Heckler & Koch (H&K) AG416 / XM320 Grenade Launcher Module.  2) Performance Output  The round must have the ability to breach doors ranging from solid wooden to medium metal.  The doors are both inward and outward opening.  The threshold requirement is breach doors from solid wooden to 18 gauge metal.  The objective is to breach up to 14 gauge metal doors.  All target doors to have a standard lock with handle.  3)  Effective Range  The threshold maximum range requirement is 35 meters.  The objective maximum range requirement is 50 meters.  The threshold minimum range requirement is 15 meters.  The objective minimum range requirement is 10 meters.  4)  Minimum Safe (Arming) Distance  The safe (arming) distance requirement is a range between 7 to 10 meters.  5)  Minimum Safe Distance  The threshold minimum safe distance is 15 meters.  The objective minimum safe distance requirement is 10 meters.  This is the minimum acceptable distance for safety from rearward projected fragments.  6) Accuracy  The threshold requirement for accuracy is the ability to hit a 36 inch square target from a distance of 35 meters.  The objective requirement is the ability to hit a 24 inch square target from 50 meters.  Please provide estimated muzzle velocities.  7)  Deflection Angle  The requirement for reliable function and full performance upon encountering a target on an angle is 15 degrees threshold with an objective of 30 degrees.  The angle is referenced from a perpendicular firing line.  8)  Fragmentation / Collateral Damage  The system should be very low fragmenting producing minimal rearward primary fragments.   Damage to the door / target itself, while minimized, is not of primary concern.  However, any explosive projectiles MUST NOT perforate the door prior to detonation.  9)  Weight  The threshold requirement for maximum system weight is 7 pounds.  The objective requirement is 5  pounds.  Where applicable, the threshold requirement for maximum weight of an individual round is 2 pounds with an objective of 1  pounds.  10)  Applicable Standards  The system should be capable of meeting the general requirements of MIL-STD-331C and MIL-STD-2105C.  11) Minimum Established Safety  All candidate rounds will be evaluated for safety to launch, by remote control, from an H&K AG416 / XM320 without damaging the weapon and without producing hazardous duds.
All interested sources are encouraged to submit company and product literature, references and any other pertinent information for the Governments evaluation in the form of a White Paper.  The White Paper product information should include system size, weight and construction materials, energetic compositions and weight, fuze and detonator details and documented and or estimated claims against the performance requirements stated above if available.  Information should also include full system descriptions and maturity information.  Potential candidates may range from conceptual to existing off the shelf solutions. This effort shall consist of an initial White Paper response to this Notice, followed by sample testing of candidate materials determined to be viable.  
The Government will perform a review of the responses and down selection of candidate rounds determined to be viable.  Organizations with selected explosive formulations will be asked to provide 20 rounds per type for testing and evaluation.
The evaluation of performance will be based on the ability to meet the above set of requirements.  The test will be conducted at Government expense.  The testing will be closed.  However, the Government will provide a report to each organization documenting the performance of that organizations material(s).  Participating organizations shall supply necessary explosive transportation and associated explosive transportation authorizations.  If necessary, the Government offers limited assistance in obtaining transportation authorizations.
The respondent must be able to demonstrate the ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion.  Interested organizations who feel they possess the necessary capabilities should respond by providing the Government a White Paper as described along with the following information; point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers and email addresses. 
This effort shall progress according to the following schedule.  White Papers responses to this Notice are due on or before 11 July 2008.

<DESC>The goal of this DHS Science & Technology research program is to develop algorithms and/or analytical tools that will assist investigators of bioterrorism events by providing precision and statistical power to inferences concerning the degree of relatedness among organisms or samples used in a bioterrorist event.  The focus of this effort will be on research in the areas microbial ecology, population dynamics, host-pathogen interaction. genetic stability, statistical inference, and match criteria for the following select agents:  Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Clostridium botulinum, Francisella tularensis, Brucella sp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei.  The objectives include:
1.  Improving our understanding of the population genetics of these pathogens to include research on genome stability, host preferences and interactions, genetic mobility of virulence factors, polymorphic sites, mutational hot spots, geographical distribution, microbial ecology, pathogen lifecycles, natural reservoirs, effects of host - pathogen interaction, etc.
2.  Improving methods for determining rates of mutation and recombination of the pathogen genomes and the identification of adaptive mutations that can have forensic utility
3.  Establishing match criteria for discriminating "difference" or "sameness" in sample comparisons. Define the parameters for inclusion or exclusion in the context of a known sample and questioned sample.  This must be backed by statistical parameters for acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis
4.  Developing  efficient, economical, and statistically rigorous sampling strategies to acquire spatially referenced genetic information on reservoirs of these pathogens
5.  Developing bioinformatics-based analytical tools for supporting hypotheses testing regarding pathogen origin that go beyond current phylogeny-based inferential methods and can meet forensic (legal) admissibility requirements of relevance and reliability.

Multiple awards are anticipated under this BAA.  This BAA has a registration process -- please see Section IV of the BAA.  Prospective Offerors must ensure that they allow sufficient time to complete the registration and submission process.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>With this announcement, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issues a pre-solicitation notice for the following project: Shoreline stabilization project is located along State Route 191 (Cutler Rd) in Whiting, ME. The project involves placement of a stone slope revetment along 500 feet of Holmes Bay, which will tie-in with an existing stone revetment. The new stone revetment plan consists of clearing and grubbing vegetation on the existing slope prior to the placement of a non-woven geotextile fabric, a 1 foot thick layer of granular fill and 2 feet of stone armor protection then be placed on top at a 1:3 slope. On the upper slope, 8 inches of topsoil soil be placed and the area will be seeded and planted with regional coastal plantings. The revetment would be approximately 500 linear feet and 20 feet high (elevation 20.0 North American Vertical Datum (NAVD)). The stone toe will be buried to approximate elevation 9.0 NAVD to accommodate restoration of intertidal habitat. The toe of the revetment will be constructed in 30-foot sections. Saltmarsh cordgrass growing within the 6,000 square foot revetment toe area, will be removed with the root mass intact and marsh soils excavated and stockpiled. These excavated materials will be reused during the backfill process as each section of the buried toe is completed. The upper area of the revetment, from elevation 20.0 feet NAVD to the top of the bank (variable elevation) will be planted with native coastal grasses and shrubs, such as speckled alder. Coastal plantings on the upper slope will replace lost riparian function and will provide an effective riparian buffer between the road and the marsh. Construction will be undertaken from land during the dry portion of the tidal cycle and is expected to take about six months to complete. Appropriate erosion control measures will be implemented throughout construction including (but not limited to) installation of a hanging silt curtain to minimize migration of fine materials during excavation and construction activities. Contractor will remove fine material collected behind erosion control structures prior to removal of these structures. Contractor required to submit a Sediment Erosion Control Plan for Corps approval prior to commencement of construction activities. These measures will assure minimal water quality impact to sensitive fish and benthic resources and provide a net gain of saltmarsh habitat. Construction vehicles should not be located in water throughout the duration of the project. The construction period for the stabilization project incorporates a moratorium on in-water silt producing activities from March 15 to June 15 for the protection of winter flounder and other Federally managed species.  In addition, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife indicated that scheduling construction outside of the August 15 to September 15 window would eliminate any adverse effects to shorebirds in the area. The estimated cost of this work is between $500,000 and $1,500,000. This solicitation is 100% Set-Aside for HUBZone Small Business concerns. The NAICS code for the work is 237990 with a small business size standard of $31 million. The solicitation shall be made available via the Internet (www.fbo.gov) on or about 3 July 2007. Registration instructions are available at this website. Amendments, if any, will be available at this Internet site. Neither telephonic, mailed, nor faxed requests for solicitation documents will be accepted. All responsible HUBZone Small Business concerns may submit a bid, which will be considered by the New England District.

<DESC>The government is in need of competitiveness/selectivity indices for universities/colleges that meet the following criteria:

1.	Index is Nationally known
2.	Index covers 4-year accredited colleges and universities
3.	Index is created by the publisher of the measure – it is not self-reported by the institution
4.	Index is updated on a regular basis

meets all five NCES criteria.  The intended sole source contract is with: 

Barron’s Educational Series, Inc.

Hauppauge, New York 11788

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting a proposal.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the posted response date will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The NAICS Code is 541990.  Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents’ capacity and capability to provide the required services. 
The primary objectives to be accomplished under these contracts are to provide FDA with: 1) Conduct drug safety analyses of importance to FDA using both retrospective and prospective methods, as appropriate; 2) Establish a collaborative arrangement with existing pharmacoepidemiologic research programs for the purpose of conducting epidemiologic studies of drug safety issues using databases containing electronic health information; 3) Establish a collaborative arrangement with existing pharmacoepidemiologic research programs for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of risk management programs and tools using databases containing electronic health information; 4) Obtain technical assistance or consultative support on methods and the use of electronic healthcare data resources for conducting pharmacoepidemiologic research, and; 5) Enable timely access to US and Canadian population-based data sources to ensure public safety when necessary.  

Data Requirements: Successful Contractors will have continuous access to an updated electronic healthcare data resource containing patient-level health encounter data from the U.S. or Canada.  The data resource shall be a computerized system able to link each patient to all relevant medical care data including enrollment status, drug exposure data, and coded medical outcomes.  This data resource will meet the criteria specified in the minimum mandatory criteria throughout the length of the contract.  Linkage of this data resource to additional information, including vital records, chronic disease and/or cancer registries, and birth defect registries, if available, is also of interest.  It shall be solely the Contractor’s responsibility to insure that the data are HIPAA-compliant, and to de-identify the data for FDA use. FDA will require no patient-, provider-, or health plan-specific identifiers.  All research performed by the FDA PRP centers must comply with standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information and protect the rights of human subjects in research.

For the purpose of this requirement, the data resource shall be sufficient to meet FDA’s need to access patient-level data describing health encounters and prescription drug use by individuals over time.  The data resource shall have longitudinal data that shall be capable of following uniquely identifiable individuals (using encrypted patient identifiers) over time.  Demographic information (e.g. age and gender), health history, diagnoses and procedures, and hospitalizations shall be provided.

The resource shall employ the use of a generally accepted, granular coding system for drugs and medical products, as well as for diagnoses and procedures.  In addition, the contractor shall have the ability to determine that the drug or biologic was dispensed to the patient, rather than just prescribed to the patient.

All patient medical diagnostic information shall be represented in the data resource, including diagnoses and procedures associated with all ambulatory, emergency, chronic or acute care setting visits and their dates, diagnoses and procedures associated with all related hospitalizations and their dates, and all laboratory tests and results (if available) and their dates.

<DESC>Description
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with 
Measurements International, Inc. 812 Proctor Avenue, Ogdensburg, NY 13669-2205 for the purchase of  Model #9300A, Temperature Controlled Standard Resistor Air Bath w/ GPIB. The specifications for this system are:

A temperature controlled standard air bath that can be controlled by the IEEE-488.2 general purpose interface bus (GPIB) from the software packages that control the Measurements International Limited (MIL) 6010C and 6000B automated resistance bridges is required.  

The air bath must have internal dimensions and capacity to hold upright four Electro Scientific Industries (ESI) or Tegam model SR-104 standard resistors.  Internal shelves with adjustable height is necessary and internal dimensions should be no smaller than 13W x 20D x 24H.

Operating temperature range should be 15 degrees C to 40 degrees C and be able to maintain stability to within 50 mK or better and accuracy of 50 mK or better.  Cooling and heating should be provided by a thermoelectric Peltier element and the chamber should have internal fans to facilitate air movement when the chamber is closed.  Temperature ramping times should be no longer than 90 minutes from 15 degrees C to 40 degrees C and from 40 degrees C to 15 degrees C.

The internal temperature should be sensed with thermistors and this internal temperature should be displayed in unit of Celsius on an external display located on the front of the camber.  Set point resolution should be 0.01 degrees C.  The user must have the option of setting the controller set point either manually from the front panel of the chamber or remotely via the GPIB from the automated software that controls the MIL 6010C and 6000B automated resistance bridges.

Based on market research, NIST has only identified one source that can provide this Temperature Controlled Standard Resistor Air Bath w/ GPIB. Measurements International, Inc., 

                Sole Source Justification:

The requested temperature controlled standard resistor air bath will be used with automated resistance bridges 6010C and 6000B used in the resistance laboratory of the Quantum Electrical Metrology Divisions.  This specific unit is 100% compatible with the control software for these bridges and will allow us to automatically change the set point and measure standard resistors on both systems and automatically collect data to determine temperature coefficients for our standards, check standards, and other resistors under test.  The 13” x 20” internal footprint and adjustable shelves of the requested air box would allow us to do automated temperature coefficient measurements on up to four Model SR-104 air-type resistance standards at one time.  The SR-104 resistors have a footprint of 12” x 8” and a height of 10”. 


The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed- price purchase order.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; however, companies that believe they can provide a solution that meets NIST’s requirments provide a written response to this notice and provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate that capability. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competition.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for purchase of 3 each of the Feed Polarizer Assembly, Andrew Corporation P/N 172816X, NSN: 5985-01-417-4618. This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), NEXRAD program, to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. BACKGROUND: Andrew Corporation brand antennas are installed at 168 Weather Service Radar (WSR-88D) radar sites. These antennas have a Feed Polarizer Assembly manufactured by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Andrew Corporation and is required for spare stock at the National Logistics Support Center located in Kansas City, MO. The Feed Polarizer Assembly is specifically for use in the antenna installed in the NEXRAD radar system. The unique characteristics and physical form of this assembly makes it the only acceptable part for this application. SPECIFIC TECHNICAL FEATURES: This particular feed polarizer assembly is application specific and the design of the assembly is the intellectual property of Andrew Corporation. Because the design is the intellectual property of Andrew Corporation, neither the Government nor any other outside entity has access to the specific design features. The form, fit, and function of this assembly is driven by the design of the next higher assembly, which the antenna itself. The Government has no design rights to the antenna, but does have limited design documentation. The limited documentation carries a restriction against providing this information to any third parties without the written consent of the Andrew Corporation. The legality of duplicating the design impacts the cost of such an effort. The NWS cannot provide a third party with design documentation needed to support the manufacture of this part. The data would have to be measured from an actual unit. It is not clear whether this would also be an infringement of Andrew's design right, but the costs would likely triple the costs of the units. The NWS performed a market research and found there are no substitute part numbers or manufacturers identified through the search. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The anticipated award date shall be within 15 calendar days after the date of this publication. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this product. Interested firms must submit support documents if providing or proposing to provide other than the specified feed polarizer assembly that meets the same fit, form and function as the specified part number. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other Government agency to which it has previously provided the item. Offerors may send their proposal to email address karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 816-274-6952 ATTN: Karen Christian. The NAICS code for this requirement is 335999. All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency. All contractors doing business with the Central Region Acquisition Division (CRAD) must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) or certification of registration in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). This is a Government initiative that was designed by the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) to replace the paper Representations and Certifications (Reps &amp; Certs) process. No award can be made unless the vendor is registered with CCR. For more information and to register with the CCR and ORCA, please access the following websites: http://www.ccr.gov/ and http://www.bpn.gov. In order to register with the CCR and ORCA offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet number.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible business firms capable of performing Design-Bid-Build construction services for a Battle Course project in the Camp Lejeune, North Carolina area as follows:
This project involves constructing a TRAINING RANGE for the Marne Corps at an area in Greater Sandy Run, an outlying area of Camp Lejeune located on North Carolina Route 50 at Wells Rd.  There is an undeveloped road there at the present time. It must be improved by some widening and drainage plus three traffic circles need to be added to allow for turn around. These roads will be used as a mock up of various configurations that troops operating anywhere in the world might encounter and where improvised explosive devices (IEDs) could be set up to inflict damage to the passing vehicles. In addition, upon turning off of NC 50 and crossing the perimeter road, the next 500 feet of the road needs to be improved to a two lane gravel road. As the land area widens, a traffic circle will need to be constructed as a turn around for the course. That shall lead into a 4 lane divided road with an island in the middle approximately 1,640 feet long. Along both sides of this road, there needs to be 17 buildings constructed to resemble an urban setting plus there needs to be a pedestrian overpass. This structure WILL NOT be used as a passageway for pedestrians.  In addition, a second traffic circle, a training compound, training bleachers will need to be constructed. Plus, a control tower that is located on site will need to be incorporated into the project and outfitted with cameras and communications to observe and control targets. 
The target award range for this project is $10,000,000 and $15,000,000.  All service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, certified HUBZone small businesses, and certified 8(a) small businesses are encouraged to respond.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice as means of market research to identify potential offerors who are capable of providing support for the TSA Office of Human Capital’s (OHC) Peer Review Program – Next Generation (PRP-NG).


Since July 2007, the TSA has expanded employee options for raising workplace complaints and appealing employment related actions by implementing a peer review appeals process, referred to as the Peer Review Pilot Program (PRPP), at designated TSA airport locations.  At the onset of the PRPP, the pilot was implemented at 13 hub airports and their respective spokes for a total of 35 airports.


Based on the success of the pilot, it is anticipated that the Peer Review Pilot Program would transition from being a pilot to an actual program at the identified 13 hub airports, plus an estimated additional 69 hubs, for a total of 82 hub airports.  During this transition from a pilot to a permanent program, the PRPP would transition some of the requirements supported by contractor personnel to TSA personnel at field sites (i.e. airports).  


Any vendor responding to this Sources Sought Notice shall provide a capabilities statement, not to exceed three (3) pages in length, in addition to a one (1) page cover letter, for a total submission not to exceed four (4) pages.  Responses to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted to the TSA via electronic mail to Sahar.Greeley@dhs.gov not later than 5:00 PM, local D.C. time, Wednesday, June 25, 2008.


There is no solicitation document presently available.  The Government will not return or pay for any information provided in response to this announcement.

<DESC>This sources sought notification is being submitted for Virtual Reality Training.  No solicitation will be posted with this notification.  No contract award will be made as a result of this notification.  If you are able to provide the services mentioned in the Performance Work Statement (below), email Brandon York at brandon.york2@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>Performance Work Statement (PWS)<BR>Telehealth and Technology<BR>Virtual Reality Clinical Training<BR><BR><BR>1.0 Introduction:  The Telehealth and Technology Directorate is acquiring training support services for the development and delivery of Therapist Clinical Training for treatment of Wounded Warriors (WW) with Psychological Health (PH) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) using Virtual Reality (VR) Technology.  The functions performed as a part of this scope of work are generally not considered inherent government functions (FAR Subpart 7.503 (c)). <BR><BR>2.0 Background: Virtual Reality (VR) Therapy, has its foundation in two well established forms of psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, (CBT) and exposure therapy.  However, unlike CBT and exposure therapy which rely on the patient/subjects ability to recall and imagine the stimuli or incidents that caused anxiety or trauma, VR creates a multisensory scenario which may resemble aspects of the original stimuli.  In doing so, the patient/subject is exposed to increasing levels of anxiety producing scenarios while maintaining a sense of mastery while in the environment.<BR><BR>VR is a tool that can be used by trained clinicians for treatment or assessment of psychological and physical disorders.  Examples of clinical applications that use VR include treatment of anxiety disorders, such as phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder.  One of the advantages of VR is that it allows more control for the therapist in conducting exposure therapy.  Ideally, the exposure should be repeated so that the individual can confront the fear numerous times.  <BR><BR>The requirements contained in this PWS are urgently needed to provide adequate treatment for our Wounded Warriors returning from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.  This project is receiving attention and oversight from the highest levels.  The identification of sources that are readily prepared to meet the requirements is essential to getting timely treatment to beneficiaries across the military services.  <BR><BR>3.0 Scope<BR><BR>3.1 The scope of this contract is for the contractor to deliver two (2), two-day trainings during the contracted period to up to 24 DoD mental health professionals, per 2-day training session, on virtual reality exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

<DESC>The purpose of this REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) is to determine if there are suppliers satisfying the governments request as follows. THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). NO PROPOSALS  are requested or accepted under this RFI and no award will be made for this effort at this time. The Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Joint Program Office is soliciting information and interest from companies capable of providing shock attenuating seating systems. A collaborative Seat Technology & Hardening Program has been established between the USMC and the Army. The purpose of the program is to utilize, leverage and otherwise share inter-service resources and capabilities to enhance the survivability of crews in the fleet of the USMC's tactical vehicles against the potentially incapacitating injuries emanating from AT mine and IED threats, particularly in the OIF theater and in Afghanistan. The crew protection objective is to be met using advanced and innovative energy attenuation (EA) technologies and devices to increase seat resistance to mine and IED loads transmitted to the occupant. Energy attenuation is generally achieved by inserting an energy absorbing device, such as deformable or friction-resistant structure, in the load path between the seat and its attachment interface with the hull. Dynamic performance will be based on occupant response in a drop tower test. Anticipated accerlerations imparted to the seat will be similar to those shown in the following attachment. DESIGN CRITERIA: The following criteria will also be used in judging overall seat performance: adjustable head rest; seat pan length and width designed for troop comfort; seat mounted restraint system (5 point); restraint adjustability; EA device between the seat mount and seat pan; lower leg protection; lateral shock attenuation capability; non flammable materials; minimum space claim; and seat back accomodation for troop hydration pack. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: A data packet detailing the vendor POC, EA technology, CAD model, vendor completed tests and mounting drawings are due two (2) weeks from the date of this posting. The packet should be sent to: Army Research Lab, ATTN: Robert Kargus, Building 203, Room 1MO50, 2800 Powder Mill Rd, Adelphi, Maryland 20783. Two (2) complete seating systems and enough EA's and supporting hardware (including mounting brackets) for 4 test events are due three (3) weeks from the date of this posting and are to be sent to the address listed above. A complete seating system is defined as the seat with EA, restraint system and all appropriate mounting hardware for integration into a vehicle. GROUND RULES: Late submissions will be accepted until August 1st with no guarantee of test. The Government will enter into a bailment Agreement with each vendor that submits test seats. The government, in exchange for the test properties, will meet with each vendor and will discuss their test results in detail.

Closing Date: July 19, 2008 5:00PM ET
 

Information is to be submitted to:  nationaldialogue@epa.gov


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is sponsoring a National Dialogue on Access to Environmental Information (http://www.epa.gov/nationaldialogue/) which includes market research on planned and existing search technologies and advanced data management and preparation practices.  EPA seeks input from the vendor community on available and near term solutions related to the focus areas established in this RFI.

The U.S Environmental Protection Agency’s Mission

The Agency’s mission to protect the environment and human health is shared by numerous other organizations at different levels of government, as well as nongovernmental and private institutions.  As a part of our ongoing efforts focused on enhancing access to environmental information, we are continually evaluating ways to leverage technology to improve access.  This must be done within the operational context of the multiple partners EPA engages with.  New advances in search capabilities and advanced data management techniques offer strategic opportunities EPA and its partners can leverage to pursue mission effectiveness.


Enhanced Environmental Information Search Capabilities Scope

Environmental information is managed in multiple ways in the digital age including traditional relational databases, geographic information systems, web pages on the internet and intranets, on line libraries and document and/or content management systems.  As EPA designs a path forward for holistic enterprise search, it is including all information, structured, semi structured and unstructured in it scope.


Immediate Focus Areas: Geographic and Temporal

EPA is requesting information that  will assist in  a thorough evaluation of technologies that enable search, initially in terms of geographic and temporal reference and ultimately with respect to the actual meaning of information in a semantic context.  We recognize that technologies related to the Semantic Web offer promise in this area, and that much work needs to be done at EPA and by our many partners in developing and applying vocabularies and ontologies that describe our vast information holdings.  However, short term opportunities exist for improving access to our information, including geographic and temporal query enhancements to our current search capabilities.

Nearly every piece of information that has ever been collected by EPA is relevant to a specific geographic area.  At this point in time, we do not have enterprise tools in place to allow consumers of our information to take advantage of this geographic context when searching for our information.  Yet, the recent explosion in the availability of consumer oriented tools for spatial exploration of both structured and unstructured, as well as search patterns evident from popular search engines, suggest that the time is ripe for facilitating place-based discovery through provision of spatial indexes to all EPA information.  For example, EPA would like to enable queries that help users understand where a set of data was collected (as opposed to where the information was published or the location where the data are held).

Likewise, the temporal dimension of search is a key area for EPA to consider in its efforts towards providing better access to environmental information.  EPA’s mission requires the ability to access information over time, in order to paint a picture of trends and quickly locate information for project and other needs.  Popular web search algorithms are largely driven by the notion that hyperlinks among pages convey a sense of the authority of the results on the target page.  Such algorithms do not explicitly consider the temporal dimension of information about the target (e.g., when data was collected or when a study was published).   In this sense, publication time could be relevant to either the actual collection / creation date of the information itself from the EPA Program or Region that is responsible for the data, or it could also convey information about the “freshness” of the content based on the web publishing date.
 As previously mentioned, the return on investment for EPA in search enhancement is multiplied when the search approach can be shared with mission partners.


EPA Search Paradigm of the Future
 
In the EPA search paradigm of the future, we recognize that the demand for environmental information will be fielded by Web 2.0 applications including collaboration technologies.  In order to engage with its partners on the future of our information, the Agency’s access strategy requires feedback on how to exploit both the spatial and temporal dimensions of environmental information, both structured and unstructured, to provide users with more relevant, direct access to the Agency’s and partners vast data and document holdings.  An example information need is “what information do EPA and others have on trichloroethylene releases in Alabama during the summer of 2007?”  In the immediate future, we are focused on enabling consumers of our data and services to discover information based on keyword search in combination with spatial and temporal constraints, which will in turn greatly improve our ability to serve our internal lines of business, as well as our external partners and customers.  In the not too distant future, as a part of this maturation process, we envision opportunities for moving beyond the development and exploitation of simple keyword indices to support content discovery and therefore request information on “intelligent “ search based on semantics.


Information as a Product

The Agency also requests information on how to prepare its information products that will be shared and re-consumed via the web so that the information products can be stamped as an Authoritative EPA source along with easily packaged metadata to enable search, discovery and understanding.


Federated Search

Search technologies that enable categorization of information returned from federated searches of EPA holdings are also of great interest.  This includes search refinements that return categorized results relevant to a particular query in a way that helps the user quickly understand what type of information is being returned.  An example of this functionality for the query “water” might be to return hits in categories of:  EPA Websites; Data; Documents and Reference Materials; and “Where You Live,” which would provide an interface to visualize search results in an interactive mapping application.

BACKGROUND	
The NTSB is an independent federal agency charged by Congress to investigate every civil aviation accident in the United States, most public-use aircraft accidents, and significant accidents in other modes of transportation (highway, marine, rail, and pipeline), to conduct special investigations and safety studies, and to issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.  The NTSB Training Center is a major initiative of the Safety Board to improve the training and skills of its own employees, and make its safety expertise and know-how more widely available to the transportation community.  In addition, the Training Center will foster an environment that encourages transportation safety initiatives and technical research; and promote uniform programs that ensure compassion, understanding and assistance for those affected by transportation tragedies.  Additional information about the NTSB and its Training Center can be found at www.ntsb.gov.

The NTSB Training Center completed its third full year at its new facility on the Ashburn, Virginia campus of The George Washington University in September 2006.  Training Center students come from accident investigation agencies around the world; past as well as potential future parties to NTSB investigations, such as equipment manufacturers and unions; disaster relief agencies, including the American Red Cross; and representatives from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.  

This course IM303, titled “Human Fatigue” is needed to ensure that NTSB investigators, support staff and transportation accident investigation professionals have the opportunity to continually develop and broaden the wide range of skills needed to maintain a high level of performance across the organization.  It is typically offered one time per year.  .

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is being issued in conjunction with FAR 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, as applicable. The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-08-00764. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is set aside for small business concerns.

The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting for a contract research organization (CRO) with the capability of conducting nonhuman primate research to provide, dose and sample the required animals. The FDA/National Center for Toxicological Research has been conducting a toxicokinetic study with intravenous and oral dosing of emulsions of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in neonatal male rhesus monkeys, which is a prelude to a subchronic toxicity study. The nonhuman primate colony at NCTR has a limited number of active Indian origin rhesus female breeders and all are of Indian origin. The toxicokinetic study has been conducted with neonatal males from our breeding colony. The subchronic study will involve a relatively large number of animals and there are also other studies with neonatal monkeys at NCTR. NCTR’s current number of breeders will not be sufficient to supply the needs of the planned studies. NCTR is considering changing to Chinese-origin rhesus monkeys for the subchronic study. Before making a final decision on this, a comparison toxicokinetic study with neonatal Chinese origin males will be conducted to confirm the suitability of Chinese-origin rhesus monkeys. The contract lab will dose the animals and collect blood samples that will be sent to NCTR for analysis. NCTR would prepare and certify the doses and treatment and sample collection protocols. The study will involve three(3) animals each treated with three single iv doses over the first nine weeks of life (one injection on postnatal day 5, one injection during week 5, and on injection during week 9), followed by a single oral dose during week 10.

The EMC DMX storage array will provide 20TB of usable primary storage to an EMC Documentum DocBase.  The EMC Documentum API, “Content Services for Centera”, will allow Documentum to control archival functions and store and retrieve aged data on the Centera in ECC-MEM.  The two Centeras will then be linked over the IRS WAN infrastructure, allowing the source data in MEM to be replicated to MTB for backup and to support future DR efforts.  Finally, this full configuration must be integrated into EMC’s service center (The SAC) for ongoing support and maintenance.  

Successful completion of these tasks will require extensive background with IRS Tier II SAN design and implementation standards, direct access to EMC engineering and existing IRS configuration information held by EMC, and full unfettered access to IRS facilities and personnel.  The skill levels of the personnel performing these tasks must be Subject Matter Expert for the following functional skill sets: Project Manager, Solutions Architect, Technology Consultant, Implementation Specialist, and Customer Engineer. The personnel also must have in-depth knowledge for integration between DMX storage and Documentum applications. Extensive experience in integration testing with AMS applications is essential.  Engineers with EMC Expert Certification are required.

D.	See attached Statement of Work and Spreadsheet for specific tasks, maintenance tasks and additional line items.  

E.  Key Personnel Element

It is the reasoned judgment of IRS Tier II Enterprise Operations that only EMC personnel can provide the required level of expertise, experience with the IRS, and knowledge and understanding of IRS integration and operational standards.

F.   Period of Performance is 12 months from date of award the performance sites will be Enterprise Computing Center – Memphis (5333 Getwell Drive, Memphis, TN 38110) and Enterprise Computing Center – Martinsburg (250 Murall Dr, Kearneysville, WV 25430)

IR1052.209-9000 Notification - Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  
Notification-Organizational Conflicts of Interest (1052.209-9000)

a. The CO has determined there is a conflict or a potential for an organizational conflict of interest associated with the performance of work for this requirement. Accordingly, the attention of prospective offerors is invited to FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest.

b. The nature of this conflict is that the IRS has a BPA TIRNO-08-Z-00016 with Government Acquisition (GA), to purchase EMC products and services.  The end user contacted GA to research their upcoming EMC requirement and was informed that a majority of the items were open market.  Once the requirement was received by procurement we sent the requirement to eight (8) GSA vendors for a price quote and none was received.  The requirement was posted on FedBizOps stating that the IRS intended to award the requirement to GA if we did not received a capability quote from another vendor(s).  On May 22, 2008 the IRS received an offer from Innovative Solutions.  The vendor was determined to be capable of meeting our requirement.  Making this a competitive requirement, during the evaluation we determined that we needed to fully develop the tasks for this requirement. In a conference call with the end users to define the tasks, the end user mentioned that they asked GA a question concerning the maintenance for EMC.  The information of a possible Conflict of Interest was written up and forwarded to our General Legal Service and the Director of Procurement.  The Director of Procurement approved a waiver allowing GA to submit a quote. Also, in an effort to mitigate any potential advantage the due date was extended from 5 days to 15 days to allow all offers a chance to fully prepare a quote.         

c. The offeror warrants that, to the best of his/her knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI), as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, or that he/she has disclosed all such relevant information. Offerors are advised that misrepresentation of the facts or failure to provide the information requested by the CO may cause the removal of their proposal from further consideration for award.

d. An offeror who believes that the performance of work under the contract may cause an OCI shall provide in its proposal to the Government a plan to mitigate the OCI. The plan will be evaluated to determine whether or not the plan effectively mitigates the potential conflict of interest such that the full scope of work contemplated by this solicitation can be performed by the offeror. The Director, Procurement, or designee, will then evaluate the mitigation plan and, if the plan is satisfactory, may grant a waiver to the offeror in accordance with FAR 9.503.

e. Restrictions on the performance of work for this requirement and/or work on future contract requirements are set forth in the Internal Revenue Service Acquisition Procedures (IRSAP) clause at 1052.905-9001 entitled Organizational Conflicts of Interest. The terms of the Organizational Conflict of Interest clause included in this solicitation are -X-- are not ___ subject to negotiations.  (End of Provision)

Offerors not in possession of the above references clauses and provisions in full text may obtain a copy via the INTERNET at http://www.arnet.gov or by contacting the contract specialist. 

H.  Offer Instructions 

All responsible sources who can provide the above requirements shall submit written quotations no later than 15 days from the posted date of this announcement.  The government intends to award a firm fixed price order. The Vendor shall be selected based on the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.  All quotes must include price(s); Quotes over 15 pages in total will not be accepted. All questions must be submitted by email to Craig.M.James@irs.gov.

Please submit your proposal electronically by Wednesday, July 2, 2008 at 12:00 NOON.  Any questions regarding this RFQ shall be submitted by email NTL Monday, June 23, 2008 at 2:00 PM EST to Craig.M.James@irs.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-25.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Fluke / Hart Scientific 1590 Thermometer and 2590 Scanner (new or used).***

Background:  The work of the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Laboratory of NIST’s Nanoscale Metrology Group involves extensive work on the dimensional measurements of nanometer scale samples and devices.  To carry out the work, extremely precise and accurate measurements are necessary.  One of the significant problems is the drift caused by the cooling water, the sample stage of the SEM and laboratory environment.  As these cool down or warm up, it changes the actual measured location on the sample.  These changes can be large, much larger than the tolerable measurement error.  According to calculations on the impact of temperature changes, even a 0.1 mK (less than a thousandths of a degree Fahrenheit) change is important.  The temperature must be measured and monitored at many locations, so beyond the main measurement unit and another one capable of switching to a larger set of sensors are also needed.  To be able to measure at this level, very specialized measurement instruments are needed.

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Continuous Flow Liquid Helium Microscopy Cryostat System. ***

Background:

NIST’s Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology requires a continuous-flow, liquid Helium microscopy cryostat mated to a customized vacuum shroud (chamber) to create a low-temperature system for optical spectroscopy applications.  The system will be used in conjunction with cryogenic motorized translation stages and user-fabricated optical fiber probes, and shall be fully compatible with both.

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

 Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Continuous Flow Liquid Helium Microscopy Cryostat System, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:

This system consists of the following components: (1) microscopy cryostat with standard sample mount, radiation shield, and lid, (2) customized vacuum shroud with user-specified feedthroughs, (3) three interchangeable sample space configurations, complete with specified sample mount, surrounding radiation shield, and necessary adapter plates, (4) pump package for creating a high-vacuum environment within the cryostat/vacuum shroud, (5) pump for pumping on the cryostat exhaust line, (6) temperature controller, (7) imaging system, and (8) accessories (including the transfer line).  The requirements for each of these components are listed below.

1.	Microscopy cryostat

a.	Continuous flow optical cryostat for microscopy (including imaging and photoluminescence) with sample in vacuum.   
b.	Liquid helium or liquid nitrogen operation
c.	Temperature range of 4.2 K (or smaller) – 300 K (or higher)
d.	Temperature stability with controller < 50 mK
e.	Nominal vibration amplitude +/-20 nm or better 
f.	Removable sample holder trimmed to a user-specified height below top window.
g.	Cryostat lid with 1” diameter top clear view window
h.	Nominal cryogen usage <1.2 liters/hr at 5 K (for cryostat alone – not including vacuum shroud or customized sample mounts)
i.	Nominal cooldown time to 10 K < 45 minutes (for cryostat alone – not including vacuum shroud or customized sample mounts)
j.	Control heater and standard curve silicon diode temperature sensor installed at the control heater
k.	One 19-pin electrical feedthrough connected to control heater and temperature sensor
l.	One blank flange on cryostat body (can be upgraded to a 10-pin or 19-pin electrical feedthrough in the future)

2.	Vacuum shroud and feedthroughs: Drawings that qualitatively indicate the desired vacuum shroud geometry are attached, with e-Drawings assembly file versions available for additional inspection if desired.  These drawings are meant to be a guide to the vendor, but the vendor shall ensure that the shroud geometry is 100% compatible with the microscopy cryostat, and is free to propose modifications to this geometry, provided that the following requirements are met:
a.	6+1 port geometry – the vacuum shroud (aluminum) shall support six identical ports, with each port using an o-ring sealed flange or equivalent geometry.  The “+1” port is an additional port that is connected to a line containing a safety pressure relief valve and a KF-25 (also called QF-25 or NW-25) vacuum pumping port with a vacuum valve. 
b.	Minimum shroud height (interior) = 3.5”, maximum shroud height (interior) = 6”
c.	Minimum shroud diameter (interior) = 6” (this is for the shroud itself – not including any bellows for probe arms, etc)
d.	Vacuum shroud shall mate to the microscopy cryostat so that high vacuum conditions can be achieved in the overall system
e.	Top lid shall have a 1.5” diameter clear view window.  Lid thickness and window thickness shall be kept as small as is possible while maintaining proper operation.  
f.	Bottom surface of the shroud shall be tapped (~20-40 holes in total on an equally spaced grid) for M2.5 or M4 screws, to create a “breadboard” surface for potential mounting of small components.  Creation of breadboard surface shall not compromise the achievable vacuum level or any other function of the system.  The exact pattern of the tapped holes will be specified after the contract is awarded.  
g.	Feedthroughs: All of the six ports of the vacuum shroud shall be the same size.  Each port shall either come equipped with either a removable blank flange or a customized removable feedthrough, as described below.  The port number is arbitrary, as the blank flanges and feedthroughs shall be compatible with any of the six ports.     
i.	Port #1: Double fiber feedthrough – this feedthrough shall allow for the incorporation of two optical fibers (250 micron diameter acrylate jacket) into the chamber in a vacuum tight manner.  The feedthrough design shall follow that of Abraham and Cornell (Applied Optics, vol. 37, no. 10, April 1998; reference attached), where a 1/8” stainless steel Swagelok compression fitting is welded to the vacuum flange, and a teflon ferrule containing two off-axis #80 (0.034 cm diameter) holes is used to insert the fibers into the chamber.  If this exact design is not followed, an equivalent design able to maintain the same vacuum level, and the same ability to insert and remove fibers without use of epoxy or another adhesive shall be employed. 
ii.	Port #2: Gas injection – this feedthrough shall consist of a stainless steel fitting welded (or epoxied) to the vacuum flange and allowing for the introduction of a 1/16” diameter stainless steel capillary into the vacuum shroud.  
iii.	Port #3: Quick flange connection – this feedthrough shall consist of the vacuum flange welded to a KF-50 (also called QF-50 or NW-50) quick-flange and blanked off with a standard KF-50 blanking flange, o-ring, and quick-release clamp.  
iv.	Port #4: XYZ arm and bellows – this feedthrough shall consist of a standard 3” long, NW25 flange stainless steel vacuum bellows and an XYZ manipulator with a minimum of 50 mm of translation in the direction towards the shroud, 25 mm of translation in the perpendicular in-plane direction, and 10 mm of translation in the vertical direction.  The probe arm to be used with this manipulator and bellows will be user-fabricated, and no probe arm is required from the vendor.  The vendor shall supply a blank flange for this port, to be used until the user-fabricated probe arm is available.  
v.	Port #5: blank flange – a blank flange will be used on this port
vi.	Port #6: blank flange – a blank flange will be used on this port

3.	Sample space configurations: Drawings that qualitatively indicate the three desired sample space configurations are attached, with e-Drawings assembly file versions available for additional inspection if desired.  These drawings are meant to be a guide to the vendor, but the vendor shall ensure that the sample space configurations are 100% compatible with the vacuum shroud and microscopy cryostat, and is free to propose modifications to these geometries, provided that the following requirements are met:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number CFIT-08-SO-0144 is issued as a Request For Quotation (RFQ) under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR Subpart 13.5).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.  This procurement is not a set-aside.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation.  The Government intends to award one Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) resulting from this solicitation.  The term of the BPA will be one (1) year.  It is anticipated that task orders will be issued during the term of the BPA for webcasting services of various meetings, hearings, and events of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” or “Commission”).  As required by task orders issued under the BPA, the contractor shall furnish managed video webcast services to support internal and external customers of the Commission.  CFTC anticipates requiring services including, but not limited to, webcasting engineering services, live video and audio webcasting, storage, web page creation, and web hosting.  The CFTC intends to use its existing video-teleconferencing (VTC) system to provide the live audio/video feed for webcasts.  However, CFTC may require the contractor to furnish additional webcast audio-visual support, including a VTC bridge audio/video feed, to bypass the existing VTC equipment.  It is anticipated that the first task order will be for events at CFTC Headquarters on July 15, 2008 and July 29, 2008.  The specific requirements for these events are included in the Statement of Work attached to this announcement.  The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  There are no addenda applicable to the provision.  The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation—Commercial Items, is applicable to this procurement.  The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are:  (1) Corporate Experience and Past Performance (not more than 5 references); (2) Technical Capability to meet CFTC’s requirements; and (3) Price.  The evaluated price will be the sum of the proposed fixed prices for the services/items CFTC determines are the most likely to occur for the first task order of the BPA.  As part of this evaluation, CFTC may also conduct a price realism analysis.  CFTC may award the BPA to other than the lowest priced offeror.  From the standpoint of the relative importance of price to the technical criteria, the technical criteria, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  However, as the merit of technical factors in competing quotations approaches equality, price will become increasingly more significant as an evaluation factor.  Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items, with its quotation.  The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  There are no addenda applicable to the clause.  The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to this acquisition:  52.219-28, Post Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation (June 2007); 52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003); 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (Feb 1999); 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity (Mar 2007); 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans (Sept 2006); 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities (Jun 1998); 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans (Sept 2006); 52.222-39, Notification of Employee Rights Concerning Payment of Union Dues or Fees (Dec 2004); 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Aug 2007); 52.225-1, Buy American Act—Supplies (June 2003); 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases (Jun 2008); 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003); 52.239-1, Privacy or Security Safeguards (Aug 1996).  All offerors shall conduct an initial site survey prior to submitting their quotation for this project.  The Commission intends to furnish each potential offeror with a tour of the applicable areas of the CFTC Headquarters building at 1155 21st Street, NW; Washington, DC, and answer technical questions that a firm may have to enable it to complete its quotation.  It is anticipated that the site surveys will be held on June 20, 2008.  Offerors are requested to notify the Contracting Officer listed in this announcement to schedule the times for their site survey.  Quotations shall include the following:  (1) Corporate Experience: A description of the services your firm offers, and its relevant experience.  This description shall not exceed one (1) page; (2) Past Performance: Provide three (3) to five (5) customer points of contact (i.e., name, title, telephone number and fax number) of other organizations for which you have provided webcasting services within the past two (2) years; (3) Technical Capability: Describe your firm’s capability to meet CFTC’s requirements and optional services (i.e., technical and schedule); (4) Price: For each of the two events, provide a firm-fixed-price for all of the services/items listed in the “Event Requirements” and “Web Hosting & Web Page Services” subsections of the “Contractor Requirements” section of the Statement of Work.  Additionally, provide firm-fixed-pricing for the individual items listed in the “Webcast Options” subsection of the Statement of Work. (Note: CFTC anticipates issuing Task Order 1 upon award of the BPA.  CFTC reserves the right to issue Task Order 1 utilizing the firm-fixed-prices quoted by the offeror in response to this solicitation.  Additionally, CFTC intends to incorporate the offered firm-fixed-prices into the BPA, which shall apply to subsequent orders placed under the BPA.)  The CFTC expects to evaluate quotations and award a BPA without conducting discussions and/or soliciting quotation revisions.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial quotation should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, CFTC reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the CFTC Contracting Officer to be necessary.  Quotations are due no later than 3:00 p.m. local (Washington, DC) time on June 25, 2008.  The quotations shall be submitted to the attention of Contracting Officer William M. Roberson, and may either be delivered to the address specified above or submitted via email to wroberson@cftc.gov.  The Contracting Officer may be contacted on (202)418-5367.  Collect calls will not be accepted.

SCOPE OF WORK
GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OFFICER


I. Background

Guyana is part of the United States’ Caribbean “Third Border.”   The U.S. relationship with the region is built on a strong and deep foundation that is centuries old and reflects the flow of peoples that have enriched the U.S.’s own culture.  The strong economic, cultural, and geographic ties between the United States and the countries of the Caribbean make their political and economic stability of vital interest to the United States.  In the Caribbean, as it is for Latin America, USAID strategic priorities seek to: advance democracy and human rights, increase economic prosperity and security, and address social and environmental issues.  The importance of these strategic priorities is reflected in the implementation of policies that address the major constraints to development.  In addition, USAID continues to provide significant humanitarian assistance for disaster mitigation and preparedness in the wake of several tropical storms and hurricanes that have affected the region.

Historical forces in Guyana have resulted in the emergence of two dominant political parties that have coalesced primarily along ethnic lines: the predominately Afro-Guyanese People’s National Congress Reform (PNC/R), which held power from 1964 to 1992, and the chiefly Indo-Guyanese People’s Progressive Party Civic (PPP/C), which has held power since the 1992 national elections.  Both major parties rely on ethnic allegiance for electoral support, and this ethnic polarization has resulted in suspicion between political parties and accusations of favoritism on the part of whichever party is not currently in power.

Consequently, antagonism often characterizes political interaction at the national level, where decision-making is highly centralized.  Although rank-and-file members serve as the voting base of the two major parties, effective mechanisms to hear and to respond to local needs and opportunities are lacking.  This situation results in most average citizens feeling helpless and skeptical of the capacity of politicians to assist them in meeting the day-to-day challenges posed by Guyana’s declining economy and vulnerable social fabric.

At present, the structure and weak capacity of government institutions contribute to the negative consequence of ethnic and racial tensions.  The executive branch is powerful and overshadows a weak National Assembly and a judiciary with relatively little independence. Although press freedom is entrenched in the Guyanese political culture, it has not been a strong force for increasing accountability, inclusiveness, and transparency in government because the members of public media are generally untrained in the ethical, analytical and communications skills required for an influential professional press.  Without fundamental reform, the country seems poised for continued ethnic conflict, limited citizen participation, and accusation of poor governance and corruption.

The current program strategy (2004-2008) seeks to consolidate democratic governance by building upon the gains made under the previous 1999-2003 program and USAID/Guyana’s comparative advantage in providing leadership in the democracy and governance area. The current objective adopts a broad-based approach that encompasses legislative processes, elections, civil society, the justice system (civil), media and ethno-political conflict reduction.

To achieve its objective, USAID/Guyana has identified a number of necessary intermediate results that include:

•	Citizens’ participation in policy making increased
•	Transparency and accountability in governance increased
•	Vulnerability to ethno-political conflict reduced

The Mission’s Democracy objective is being implemented through a Contract with Research Triangle Institute International (RTI International) and its sub contractors.  The subcontractors (DPK, Aurora and Democracy International) have organized their respective activities under program components.

The Government of Guyana’s overriding development objective, as outlined in both its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and National Development Strategy, is to increase incomes across social levels and reduce the level and incidence of poverty.  Increasing jobs and earnings require stimulating business activity and productivity.  However, with a population of only 750,000, Guyana’s domestic market is too small to provide a viable base for long-term growth.  Therefore, the chief strategy available for creating sustainable growth lies in the development of value-added, non-traditional exports.  Successful expansion of exports will require strengthening the domestic environment for exports, with particular emphasis on improving policies and stimulating greater entrepreneurship in Guyana.  In addition, Guyanese exports will need to be competitive in terms of quality, service, special characteristics, and price.  Export growth will need to take place in order over the long-term and be sustainable in order to increase revenues and reduce poverty.

Guyana’s trade environment is relatively weak.  It is a small economy within the Caribbean Common Market, and lacks sufficient analytical capability to influence trade negotiations and agreements.  Yet these agreements directly affect Guyana’s ability to export certain products, and could even pressure Guyana into increased export competition.  Guyana needs to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these agreements and the negotiating process itself, and the Government must do more to improve the incentives for foreign investment and trade.  The Government and public sector must act in concert to provide Guyana with world-class institutions and services that create an environment for business and investment that is low-risk and offers profitability incentives for meeting or exceeding customer expectations.

USAID’s Economic Growth program supports interventions designed to address the two key constraints to improving the environment for sustained growth of value-added exports.  On the “demand” side, Guyana needs to strengthen “rules-based” incentive structures for attracting investment and increase its participation in trade-led economic growth.  On the “supply” side, Guyanese businesses need to strengthen their capacity to play by the internationally-defined “rules of trade” so that export-led sectors, industries, and firms can competitively produce and market their goods and services.

The Guyana Trade and Investment Support Project (GTIS) is the principal vehicle through which USAID's economic growth program is implemented in Guyana.  CARANA Corporation is USAID's implementing partner.  The GTIS Project is designed to maximize Guyana’s benefits from international trade agreements and position target firms to exploit market opportunities. The approach is based on the premise that targeted activities focusing on Guyana’s industry-specific critical success factors can create an environment for sustainable growth. The project is broken into four key components:
The first organizes industry clusters, identify their key success factors, and work with institutional actors to help create an export growth environment;
 The second provides firm-level technical assistance focused on specific factors (standards, quality management, and marketing) that will generate exports;
 The third strengthens the private-public consultative process and increases civil society support to enable progressive policy movement; and 
 
The fourth implements trade capacity building activities that will assist public stakeholders to turn existing trade commitments (CARICOM, WTO, bilateral agreements) into real market opportunities for businesses.



In addition to its Democracy & Governance and Economic Growth Programs, the USAID/Guyana portfolio comprises a President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program and a Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) Threshold Program.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 30 June 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 28 June 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Tracey Burgess at 252-335-6790.  Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

<DESC>Questions and Answers for clarifying the SOW.<BR><BR>1.	Will resurfacing require the contractor to emplace Aircraft anchors and grounding points?  <BR>At this time, it is not anticipated that resurfacing will be done in tie-down areas.  If that changes, then CLIN BG for misc will have to be utilized for work that does not fit an existing CLIN.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>2.	Will soils that are exposed/excavated require testing?  Concerned sites include the POL Bldg and the Fueling area?  <BR>At this point, it is not anticipated that the excavation line item will be utilized.  If excavation is necessary, contractor will be required, as is the case anywhere on Post, to have someone capable to monitor the excavation for obvious contamination.  Should contamination be observed, the protocol is for excavation to be suspended, and 911 to be contacted.  How we proceed from there will depend upon the levels found and direction given by environmental div.  We will not be testing exposed/excavated material that does not present a contamination hazard.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>3.	Repaving of the runway, the width to be paved will not include the runway lights?  <BR>Repaving will be just that, replacing paving to the existing lines and grades.  With the exception of the two concrete aprons at the ends of the runway, no lights currently exist in the pavement structure.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>4.	Can the contractors get scope for each sub-job?  <BR>This is an IDIQ type contract.  The tasks are not yet defined, pending knowledge of CLIN valuation.  Specific work will come as task orders, following award.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>5.	If the concrete pads and both ends of the runway are to be redone; will the lights be reinstalled in those pads?  <BR>The lights in the end aprons will be part of any upgrade of those aprons.  The method of strengthening those aprons has not yet been determined.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>6.	How much and when will each Sub-CLIN be required?  <BR>Usage will be based upon task orders awarded and funds available.  The government tried to be somewhat realistic in developing the estimated quantities but these are not guaranteed.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>7.	Will escalation factors be incorporated into the contract and how will that impact evaluation of the bids?<BR>  Since the performance period is for only one year, no escalation factors are anticipated.  KO might evaluate on possibility of escalation for work that is not completed this season, should costs escalate uncontrollably.<BR><BR>

BACKGROUND	
The NTSB is an independent federal agency charged by Congress to investigate every civil aviation accident in the United States, most public-use aircraft accidents, and significant accidents in other modes of transportation (highway, marine, rail, and pipeline), to conduct special investigations and safety studies, and to issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.  The NTSB Training Center is a major initiative of the Safety Board to improve the training and skills of its own employees, and make its safety expertise and know-how more widely available to the transportation community.  In addition, the Training Center will foster an environment that encourages transportation safety initiatives and technical research; and promote uniform programs that ensure compassion, understanding and assistance for those affected by transportation tragedies.  Additional information about the NTSB and its Training Center can be found at www.ntsb.gov.

The NTSB Training Center completed its third full year at its new facility on the Ashburn, Virginia campus of The George Washington University in September 2006.  Training Center students come from accident investigation agencies around the world; past as well as potential future parties to NTSB investigations, such as equipment manufacturers and unions; disaster relief agencies, including the American Red Cross; and representatives from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.  

This course IM303, titled “Human Fatigue” is needed to ensure that NTSB investigators, support staff and transportation accident investigation professionals have the opportunity to continually develop and broaden the wide range of skills needed to maintain a high level of performance across the organization.  It is typically offered one time per year.   

 
SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor shall instruct in training modules for the Human Fatigue areas focused on transportation accident investigation.  It will be of interest and be made available to audiences that include, law enforcement, other federal agencies, NTSB partners in transportation accident investigations, and transportation professionals. The course will be given on two consecutive days, with at least 8 contact hours per day. 

The contractor shall have recognized expertise in the following areas:
•	Scientific knowledge on medical issues involved in fatigue and how fatigue varies with time of day
•	Excessive sleepiness and fatigue; their origins in sleep loss, disturbed sleep and circadian rhythms
•	Effects of fatigue on human physiology, performance, health and safety; and countermeasures for these effects.
•	Sleep disorders and circadian rhythms effect on diverse aspects of human performance
•	Severity and variability of fatigue effects
•	Effects of medications and other factors (e.g. environment, workload) on performance and alertness.

The contractor shall provide the following coordination and instructional support.
-	Physiological and neurobehavioral effects of sleep deprivation, circadian rhythm disturbance, prolonged work demands, and social isolation, on cognitive, psychological, and biological functions in humans challenged to perform at high levels
-	Alertness promoting and cognitive benefits of “prophylactic naps” as fatigue countermeasures, and the factors that influence nap physiology and benefits
-	Sleep apnea effects on neurobehavioral performance, and the role of therapy in reducing these consequences; the prevalence of sleep apnea in commercial truck drivers
-	Neurocognitive and physiological changes due to chronic sleep restriction;
-	Novel uses of wake-promoting drugs on alertness and performance
-	Technology for measuring the effects of sleep loss on attention
-	Standards for evaluating technologies designed to enhance human awareness of neurobehavioral decrements

1)	Develop course content and materials in the areas of effects of sleep deprivation, circadian rhythm disturbance, prolonged work demands, sleep apnea, wake-promoting drugs, new and emerging technologies, and sleep countermeasures. Act as an authoritative source of information and developer for these course topics. 
2)	Prepare course materials, handouts, demonstrations, and visual presentations PowerPoint) to conform to new technologies or procedures, changes and additions. 
3)	Develop course exercises.  Develop and present exercises to allow for hands-on-training and to demonstrate new methodologies and techniques in the areas listed above.
4)	Make changes to teaching materials.  Modify, update and retool lesson plans and other course materials (see 2 above) as necessary to reflect new research, methods, techniques and developments in the field of Human Fatigue.
5)	Teach specified modules in the approved course.

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
FOR
DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY (DLA)
EMERGENT R&D REQUIREMENTS 
JUNE 4, 2008
________________________________________
POINT OF CONTACT: 	Mr.  John Dormer, Contracting Officer  
Defense Supply Center Philadelphia
DLA Contracting Support Office DSCO-P
700 Robbins Avenue, Building 26-1
Philadelphia, PA 19111

1.  BACKGROUND

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Research & Development (R&D) Branch is charged with conducting research and development in all areas relevant to the DLA mission and across all DLA supply chains. DLA defines its current R&D requirements each year and seeks funding for them through the Department of Defense’s Program Planning, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process. These planned-for requirements produce a robust logistics R&D program addressing areas such as energy readiness, combat rations, uniform manufacturing, shelters, casting and forging, weapon system sustainment, medical logistics and electronics availability. Despite these ongoing efforts, other R&D requirements arise each year that could not have been anticipated and were not budgeted.

DLA’s need for this “Emergent (R&D) Requirements BAA” stems from the appearance of these unplanned-for R&D requirements that are not addressed by the PPBE process.  Most of these requirements are in the form of additional research areas (beyond those funded by DLA’s President’s Budget request) added by Congress to the DLA R&D appropriation each year. Other emergent requirements come from DLA operations as new challenges to meet some kind of unplanned Agency need in the course of the year. These requirements can address virtually any logistics-related R&D topic and each year generally presents a mixture of new projects and new funding on prior years’ congressionally directed efforts.
	
2. GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION

This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of one year from the date of publication.   No additional information is available, nor shall a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same shall be disregarded. Interested entities may submit a white paper for any logistics R&D requirements. The Government reserves the right to request a full technical and cost proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not guarantee funding or assure a subsequent award. Any responsible source capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a white paper which shall be considered by DLA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit white papers and join others in submitting white papers; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology.  Large Business concerns will be required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.  For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard for Small Business is fewer than 500 employees.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a white paper to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail is preferred.  White papers may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent shall be disregarded.  

3. AREAS OF INTEREST

DLA is interested in receiving white papers ONLY for R&D for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding in defense logistics. The particular emergent requirements that are the subject of this BAA are: 

(1) to operate a network of lean manufacturing experts who will combine high-level strategic consulting and hands-on assistance to help small to midsized manufacturers who are lower-tier suppliers to DoD primes improve their operations and improve performance by making those suppliers faster, more flexible, leaner and more efficient; 

(2) to provide training and one-on-one assistance to small manufacturing firms to upgrade their capabilities to supply obsolete parts to DoD by enhancing their reverse engineering capabilities, including developing acceptable technical data packages; 

(3) to explore the use of various biofuels feedstocks in jet fuels and examine the impact of introducing biofuels into the current jet fuel delivery stream; 

(4) to develop small manufacturers as DoD suppliers for DLA’s Battlefield Back-Order Breakout Initiative (B3I) program , which seeks to provide parts urgently needed in-theater from new suppliers; and

(5) to address parts backorder reduction by conducting requirements analyses and technical risk assessments and developing prototype tools to improve management of warfighter materiel. 

White papers may be based on fundamental research and development; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements and processes; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; development of associated industrial capabilities support techniques and processes; development of associated manufacturing techniques and processes; modeling and simulation; simulation-based acquisition; integrated data environments and product data managers; and development of operational systems. 

5. EVALUATION CRITERIA 

White papers will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs (subject to the availability of funds).  These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price. Any responsible businesses may submit a white paper. White papers may be submitted at any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  Please refer to BAA number BAA 0004-08 in all correspondence and communications.  The BAA will remain open for approximately 1 year for submission of white papers. 

6. WHITE PAPER FORMAT

The following guidelines apply to concept papers or white papers. In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties are advised to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper"). This white paper should not exceed 5 pages, with a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. Offerors should submit the white papers electronically.  A title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work must accompany the white paper. The Government reserves the right to request a full technical and cost proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not guarantee funding or assure a subsequent award. Offerors may submit full technical and cost proposals even if they did not submit a white paper or their white paper was not identified as promising. The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail.  White papers for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding.

The following evaluation factors must be addressed in the white paper:  (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives.

(1)  OVERALL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT: Offerors will propose a project that includes: (a) The improved logistics capability to be established, expressed in terms of outcomes that are important to the Logistics Support process; (b) Clear description of problem being addressed and tasks to be performed and deliverables to be provided; (c) Realism of (a) and (b) above.

(2) POTENTIAL RELEVANCE AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE AREA OF INTEREST.  Offerors shall propose projects that address (a) the applications of the technology; (b) how the technology will address long and short term needs of the Department of Defense and (c) the expected benefits.

(3) DEGREE TO WHICH NEW AND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO TECHNICAL ISSUES IMPORTANT TO THE AREA OF INTEREST ARE PROPOSED AS WELL AS THE DEGREE TO WHICH TECHNICAL DATA OR COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED UNDER THE PROPOSED EFFORT ARE TO BE DELIVERED WITH UNRESTRICTED RIGHTS.

(4) THE OFFEROR'S CAPABILITIES, RELATED EXPERIENCE, FACILITIES, TECHNIQUES OR UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF THESE WHICH ARE INTEGRAL FACTORS FOR ACHIEVING THE PROPOSAL OBJECTIVES.  Offerors shall provide information pertaining to prior significant and related work experience or expertise in any of the listed areas of interest, and how that expertise shall be beneficial to this program. Offerors shall provide the two largest accounts/contracts/projects within the last three years for which they have provided services and/or supplies of a nature consistent with this program. Offerors shall include at least two (2) points of contact and a telephone number for each account/contract, a description of the service or supply which was provided, as well as a brief performance history on each of those accounts/contracts. Where related work was performed with teaming partners, provide points of contact of teaming members to include company name, individuals and phone numbers. 

(5) THE QUALIFICATIONS, CAPABILITIES AND EXPERIENCE OF THE PROPOSED PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR, TEAM LEADER OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL WHO ARE CRITICAL IN ACHIEVING THE PROPOSAL OBJECTIVES.

(6) COST REALISM: The cost realism will include a rough estimate of all of the cost information related to the Project Task, including direct labor and indirect costs.

<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause- <br />"Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the CCR database" means that- <br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- <br />(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. <br />(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: <br />(i) Company legal business. <br />(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. <br />(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and ZIP Code. <br />(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and ZIP Code (if separate from physical). <br />(v) Company Telephone Number. <br />(vi) Date the company was started. <br />(vii) Number of employees at your location. <br />(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. <br />(ix) Line of business (industry). <br />(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). <br />(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. <br />(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. <br />(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(g) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br /><br />DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (HHSAR) (48 CFR CHAPTER 3) CLAUSES<br /><br />No. HHSAR Citation Title Date<br />1. 352.202-1 Definitions JAN 2006<br />2. 352.215-1 Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition JAN 2001<br />3. 352.215-70 Late Proposals and Revisions JAN 2006<br />4. 252.223-70 Safety and Health JAN 2006<br />5. 352.224-70 Confidentiality of Information JAN 2006<br />6. 352.232-9 Withholding of Contract Payments JAN 2006<br />7. 352.270-2 Indian Preference APR 1984<br />8. 352.270-3 Indian Preference Program JAN 2006<br />9. 352-270-4 Pricing of Adjustments JAN 2001<br />10. 352.270-6 Publications and Publicity JAN 2006<br />11. 352.270-7 Paperwork Reduction Act JAN 2006</p>

<SUBJECT>Independent Test and Evaluation Authority (ITEA) to support the Quality Assurance process for FERC systems
<SOLNBR>FERC08-RFP-80999
<RESPDATE>062508
<CONTACT>Sanjay Sardar, Deputy Director of the Chief Information Officer (DCIO), Email FERC08-RFP-8099@ferc.gov
<DESC>								02 June 2008
Request for Proposal:

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Deputy Director of the Chief Information Officer (DCIO)  has a requirement for Independent Test and Evaluation Authority (ITEA) to support quality assurance process for the FERC IT Systems. In order to meet the needs of this requirement, the FERC has determined that the most expeditions method of reviewing and evaluating all offeror capabilities would be through oral presentations.  As such, your are invited to review the technical statement of work located at www.ferc.gov, and specifically, http://www.ferc.gov/about/offices/oed/oed-proc/FERC08-RFP-80999.asp.  You are also instructed to review RFP FERC08-RFP-80148, located at the same URL address, because your ability to perform ITEA for the services procured under this competition may also be required during the life of the awarded ITEA contract.
.
In order to meet federal competitive requirements as well as program schedule requirements, the FERC has determined that a competition utilizing streamlined procedures is the best overall approach to meet these goals.  As previously stated, all potential offerors shall provide their technical approach utilizing an oral presentation.  This process possesses certain rules that the offeror must abide by.  Failure to follow the following rules shall render the presentation non responsive, and therefore, unavailable for award.

-	Technical Solution and Methodology must conform to the requirements of the Technical Statement of Work, dated June 02,  2008, and located at http://www.ferc.gov/about/offices/oed/oed-proc/FERC08-RFP-80999.asp
-	Only technical information shall be presented
-	No more than 30 slides 
-	The presentation shall not require a presentation lasting more than 60 minutes
-	The offeror shall provide a detailed response for each evaluation factor listed in Section 3. of the Technical Statement of Work, dated June 02, 2008. 
-	Questions are due not later than Tuesday, June 10, 2008, 5:00PM EDT, and shall be forwarded by email to sanjay.sardar@ferc.gov.  Failure to meet this date/time shall cause you to forfeit your opportunity to submit questions.
-	Oral Presentation offers are due not later than Wednesday, June 25, 2008, 5:00PM, EDT, and shall be forwarded by email to FERC08-RFP-8099@ferc.gov.  Failure to meet this deadline shall render your oral presentation nonresponsive and therefore unavailable for award.

Once received, the FERC may require some or all of the offerors to present their oral presentations to a technical evaluation team.  Conversely, the FERC may decide that a competitive range be established without benefit of holding presentations. Under either scenario, you will be notified via email. If oral presentations are to be held, all date/time slots shall be randomly assigned.  It is the intention of this competition to award a single contract to one firm (or a team of firms for which the lead offeror is accountable) for the work to be performed and on the basis of the overall best value to the government.  As such, upon completion of the technical review, the government team shall down select to three (3) or fewer technical proposals, thereby establishing the competitive range.  Those offerors chosen for the competitive range shall be notified via email and a cost proposal shall be requested.  Upon evaluation of the cost proposal, the government shall enter discussions with one or more offerors, if necessary.  Award shall be made to that offeror determined to be the best overall value to the government. The government reserves the right to award to the lowest priced offeror.  

The date of submission for the oral presentation offers has been extended to Wednesday 25th, 2008 5Pm EST and shall be forwarded via email to FERC08-RFP-8099

Several questions have been asked about the FERC Documentation Library (FDL).  The FDL will be available for pickup Wednesday 18th June 2008 through Friday 20th June 2008 at the following location.

FERC

<p>1: Combine requirement FD2020-08-77112 with requirement FD2020-07-77029 adding an additional dollar amount of $804,882.87 to the total.</p>
<p>2: Increase total dollar amount from $611,819.18 to $4,591,771.11.&nbsp; Additional funds in the amount of $3,736,581.84 were given&nbsp;to the ACRN that initially had&nbsp;$611,819.18 and an FMS requirement has also been added to this requirement for a total of $50,306.40 (3,736,581.84+804,882.87+50,306.40 = $4,591,771.11)</p>
<p>3: Therefore, in an effort to combine these two revised requirements, the&nbsp;additional CLINs 0001AD, 0001AE, 0001AF, 0001AG have been added to accurately reflect the purchase requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4: All CLINs will be buy-to-dollar with the exception of CLIN 0001AD (Bid A) and CLIN 0001AG (Bid B) as these CLINs reflect&nbsp;the purchase of FMS materials and will therefore will buy-to-quantity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers for RFI0007 – VOR Antenna RFI
	As of 18 June 2008
1.   16 June 2008
Question:  Under the description it states c/kc-135 VOR antenna is becoming unsupportable?  Please clarify that statement.  Also, is this just for a quote or a real requirement?
Answer:  The current antenna is out of date and therefore it is being impossible to keep them in working order so we are looking to replace them altogether.  The notice you are looking at is only a Request for Information (RFI) is not a request for quote.  We are simply looking for information before we do a request for quote.

1.  INTRODUCTION:  The Air Force Small Business Solutions Center Mentor-Protégé Office is soliciting WHITE PAPERS from eligible mentors interested in participating in the Department of Defense (DoD) Mentor-Protégé Program.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  Those WHITE PAPERS found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal in accordance with (IAW) this BAA, subject to need and the availability of funds.  This BAA announcement will remain in effect until 30 September 2008.

IAW Section Two of the Presidential Executive Order 13360, and in order to significantly increase contract and subcontract award opportunities to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), we highly encourage SDVOSBs participate as protégés or mentors (if eligible) in the program.

2.  OBJECTIVE:  The purpose of this Department of Defense (DoD) program is to provide incentives to prime DoD contractors to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of the protégé firms to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements.  This is accomplished by technical and developmental assistance from the mentor to the protégé.  Under this program, approved mentor firms will enter into Mentor-Protégé agreements with eligible protégés.  A complete description of the DoD program and eligibility requirements is provided in Appendix I of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).  In addition, you can visit the Air Force Small Business Website at http://www.selltoairforce.org/programs/mentorprotege/default.aspx to obtain detailed Air Force MP Program information.  Proposed agreements consisting primarily of business infrastructure, management and marketing assistance will not be considered for approval. The Air Force is focusing on Mentor-Protégé agreements that have a strong technical component or focus on innovative state of the art technology transfer in the domains of air, space and cyberspace.

b.  WHITE PAPER EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:

(1)  Relevance of proposed technology to current DoD/AF requirements as listed in paragraph 2.

(2)  Overall technical approach to providing transfer of technology.

(3)  Capacity, capability and proposed metrics to achieve the objectives of this BAA.

c.  WHITE PAPER NOTICES / REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be requested to submit a technical and cost proposal, subject to available funding.  Proposals will be due 30 calendar days from receipt of notification letter sent by the Contracting Officer.  This invitation does not ensure that the mentor will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner with reasoning for non-selection. 

PHASE TWO – REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL

5.  PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be evaluated against the technical criteria as listed in paragraph 6.b below.  Proposals that represent one or more of the top technical categories as listed in paragraph 2 will result in a more favorable ranking.  Proposals will be ranked from the highest to lowest based upon a subjective evaluation performed by the Air Force evaluation team, based upon DoD/AF’s requirements and focused areas.  Awards will be made starting at the highest ranked proposal, descending down in order, for all technically acceptable proposals, contingent upon availability of funding, successful completion of negotiations, and current Air Force requirements.

6.  PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: Upon Request for Proposal (RFP), the mentor shall provide an original and 1 copy on CD-ROM in Word or PDF format to the AFDW/A7KS address and 3 hard-copies, plus 1 copy on CD-ROM in Word or PDF format to the AFOPO/CCP address identified in paragraph 4.  Recommended proposal format: double-sided 8 1/2 x 11 pages; 12-point font with one (1) inch margins.  Proposals shall be valid for at least 120 days.

(4)  Mentor and Protégé Past Performance Information:  Two (2) pages maximum.  Identify all past, and active mentor-protégé agreements, and proposed agreements under consideration and identify with what agency.  Include information on any formal or informal mentor-protégé experience.

b.  VOLUME TWO – TECHNICAL VOLUME:  Proposals shall be presented in the exact sequence as the technical criteria below and should be constructed so it easily tracks to the Cost Volume – Volume Three.  Volume Two, upon award, will be incorporated into the contract and serve as the Statement of Work.  

(1)  Comprehensive Needs Assessment:  Demonstrate a comprehensive Protégé needs assessment was performed prior to proposal submittal by summarizing the results of the needs assessment. Example needs assessment templates are available on the Sell to Air Force Website - http://www.selltoairforce.org/programs/mentorprotege/mp_examples.aspx. Variations and modifications to the example templates are acceptable to best reflect the results of the protégé needs assessment.  The needs assessment should focus on technology and developmental assistance within the identified technical categories set forth in paragraph 2.  Color coding, numeric ranking or similar means of priority needs assessment results is recommended and highly encouraged.  The government may validate the comprehensive needs assessment using either internal MP Program personnel or an outside independent agency.
  
(2)  Technical Approach to Needs Assessment:  Identify relevant technologies set forth in paragraph 2, business infrastructure and developmental areas using the Tech Approach Outline example template at http://selltoairforce.org/programs/mentorprotege/mp_examples.asp.  Tailor this template to provide a thorough description of the specific approach to address the technology and developmental areas identified in the needs assessment.  Describe what, when, and how the assistance will be provided and by whom (e.g., OJT, workshops, seminars, development or update of business plans, HBCU/MI, PTAC, SBDC).  Describe involvement of HBCU/MI, PTAC and SBDC faculty and interns.  Variations and modifications to the example template are acceptable to best reflect the proposed Technical Approach.

(a)  Technology transfer must equate to no less that 70% of the total proposed effort. 

(b)  The AF mandates a minimum 5% requirement of total proposed contract value for HBCU/MI, PTAC and/or SBDC subcontracting.

•	Status of Return on Investment
•	Status of Semi-Annual report submission
•	Other 

(5)  Cost Criteria:  Provide adequate and realistic cost or pricing data to support proposed technical approach (see paragraph 6c, Volume Three - Cost Volume).

c. VOLUME THREE – COST VOLUME:

(1)  The cost volume shall be presented using the Excel spreadsheet template at Attachment 1.  The labor categories and task descriptions presented in the template are examples.  The actual categories and task descriptions are dependent on the contractor’s approach and cost accounting system.  The costs shall be presented in Excel format, with formulas, and the spreadsheets shall not be locked.  If they are not presented in Excel format, they will be considered non-responsive.   Mentors shall provide proposed cost data for each year proposed, not to exceed two (2) years, unless a second option year is pre-approved (see paragraph 3).  Hours and dollar values associated with technology transfer should be not less that 70% of the total proposed labor hours and costs, and must track to each technology and developmental assistance category proposed in Volume Two (Technical Volume).  Volume Three shall contain separate specific costs that show which costs are clearly attributable to the 70% transfer of desired technology, and the 30% attributable transfer to business related items.

(2)  Provide adequate, realistic and auditable support for all labor, travel and incidental costs proposed for both the prime and authorized subcontractors (protégé, HBCU/MI, PTAC, SBDC).

(3)  Provide copy of rate approval letter for approved forward pricing rates and identify the cognizant DCAA office.

(4)  Provide all travel expenses broken out by individual trip with justification.

ACPS ? PBL, Request for Information (RFI)

Request for Information:  This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations as how best to define requirements for a full service Performance Based Logistics (PBL) solicitation/contract in support of Air Conditioning Plant Systems located on CVN 68 - 75 and CVN 76, 77 & 78 Class Aircraft Carriers.   A future solicitation/contract would provide total support and management services in support of Aircraft Carriers located worldwide. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

Background:  DSCC is the lead DLA center for maritime weapon systems.  DSCC is responsible for providing the Navy with the highest level of support, worldwide.  It is DLA?s goal to provide the best value to our military customer while reducing costs and improving efficiencies.  To meet our goals and future customer challenges, DSCC is continuing to benchmark with the private sector to determine which industry practices can be adopted to support the requirements of the Navy.  DSCC, in working with the Navy, has determined that a performance based contract would effectively support the warfighter.  Further review of the Navy PBL guide can be located at www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/acps/index.html.

DSCC- Maritime intends to use information resulting from the RFI responses to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budgeting assumptions, and performance specifications to be included in the RFP.

Objectives:  DSCC ? Maritime will utilize a full service PBL contract to enhance support of the Air Conditioning Plant Systems.  The overarching objective is to reduce cost without degrading current system readiness and reliability.  DSCC will capture industry?s cost estimates for requirements that are listed in the SOO.  Addressing elements, which are described in the SOO, is essential in the RFI responses. 
 
The Government contemplates possibly issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15, that may result in a fixed price contract lasting10 ? years (2 year base with 8, one ? year options).  Estimated award date is 4th quarter FY 09.  Based on the results of a business case ?best value? analysis, DSCC ? Maritime, may elect to solicit/award by Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) to single or multiple vendors.  Prospective vendors may respond to individual or all CLIN?s.

Responses:  Written response to this RFI shall be limited to 25 pages, single space.  If material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  Response should include, but is not limited to the following:  
(A)	Company History:  A one page history to include; Small Business Administration (SBA) size classification; major products; and primary customer base.  Additionally RFI responders should provide examples of past experience that would warrant the Government?s consideration of the company as a prospective contractor for maintenance, supply support, training and all other services listed in the SOO.
(B)	Metrics:  Metrics recommended and methods to create and maintain a metrics database, for monitoring the performance of each functional area of the contract.  Also discuss how metrics can be used to promote an incentive/disincentive based contract award structure.  
(C)	Additional Information:  Technical or otherwise, the company deems necessary to aid the government in making an informed assessment of the suitability of the commercial marketplace to accomplish sustainment of the subject AC plants.  The technical responses should address elements in the SOO.

The MKS configuration management software serves as the toolset to manage the application version control, software change requests, the configuration items (CIs) and the metrics captured are necessary for audit ability, traceability and an adherence to the standards of a full software development life cycle (SDLC) and will be instrumental in current project success and ease of future project planning and implementation. To facilitate the development efforts of IPMS systems, HR/EX purchased MKS Integrity Suite 2005 software in April 2006.  This software has provided the developers, testers and managers the ability to control change more efficiently, effectively, and with greater proficiency.  This purchase is for the maintenance renewal of the software product. This action is taken in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as identified by FAR 6.302-1. The MKS software provided a level of administrative ease that the other products did not offer.  MKS was less labor intensive and easier to implement due to the user friendly administrative functionality of the tool.  Other tools required additional hardware and dedicated administrative personnel.<BR><BR>

The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 SMART servers, along with these other components, have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure.IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed. Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs.Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost. <BR><BR>Required Hewlett Packard DL380G5, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4, servers, and related infrastructure equipment (described above and in the attached) are required for SMART. These servers have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.   This acquisition will be advertised on FedBid, a reverse auction site.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Precision Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA201) intends to procure on a competitive basis the System Design and Development (SDD) of a non-pyrotechnic Multi-Purpose Bomb Rack (MPBR) for carriage and release of weapons and stores employed on BRU-33, BRU-41, BRU-42 and BRU-55 bomb racks.  This rack must employ weapons and stores cleared to the current envelope of the F/A-18+/C/D and E/F series aircraft.  This rack is also intended for employment of future weapons such as Joint Air to Ground Missile and Small Diameter Bomb and for integration on the JSF and other objective platforms.  A complete list of threshold and objective stores and platforms is contained in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) as Attachment 1 to the draft solicitation/RFP.  Accommodation of objective stores and platforms is not required for the supplier to submit a qualified proposal.  However, the Government will consider proposals that do accommodate objective stores and platforms to have additional merit above those which are threshold-compliant only.

A major objective of this SDD effort is to minimize flight-testing and re-certification of the threshold stores on the threshold aircraft by requiring the MPBR conform to the Outer Mold Line of the BRU-33 bomb rack, with the addition of store umbilicals and supporting hardware.  Offerors who have the skills, experience, qualifications and knowledge required to successfully develop and provide an MPBR will be required to submit a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computer analysis of the Offerors design concept.  Specific details for the CFD will be contained in the draft RFP.

A DRAFT solicitation/RFP is being posted to the NAVAIR homepage.  The NAVAIR homepage is located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  To find the draft solicitation/RFP you must select ‘Doing Business with Us’ and then ‘Open Solicitations’ or call the help desk at (301) 342-4686 if you  are in need of further assistance.  Except as noted here, the Government will only release the draft solicitation/RFP, including any subsequent amendments, over the Internet.  The solicitation number is N00019-08-R-0058.  Attachments associated with the DRAFT solicitation/RFP will NOT be posted with the draft RFP and may be obtained by following the information stated below.  

Any amendments issued will be posted on the same NAVAIR web page.  After the draft solicitation release, vendors should regularly access the website to ensure they have all amendments.  Failure to obtain any posted amendments and to respond to each of them prior to the date and time set for receipt of offers may render your offer non-responsive. 

A competitive performance-based specification solicitation for the MPBR effort is anticipated for release in the 4th quarter of FY08.  A Best Value source selection is planned with an anticipated award in FY09.  Interested parties should check this web site periodically for updated information.
 

RELEASE OF TECHNICAL DATA:  This program includes information that has been designated a “Distribution D” and is only releasable to current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  In addition, the program requires a procurement effort in certain critical technologies/data that are not releasable to foreign firms.  Some documents are under Federal export control for “sensitive” or “controlled” technologies regulated by the U.S. Department of State’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) protecting national security.  Data may not be exported without an approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.  As such, the documents contain data whose export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law and dissemination to non-U.S. persons whether in the United States or abroad requires an export license or other authorization.  Disclosure of the controlled drawings requires the verification of a current license for the oral, visual or documentary disclose of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons as defined under the U.S. Department of State website, https://pmdtic.org/licenses.htm.

To participate in this program, a foreign firm may be required to team with a U.S. firm that possesses a current and valid U.S. facility clearance with technologies/data safeguarding capabilities, inclusive of the authority to receive critical technology and/or data required to execute this program. Any resultant contractor teaming or license agreements between U.S. firms and foreign firms, to include employment of foreign nationals by U.S. firms, shall be in accordance with current U.S. export laws, security requirements, and National Disclosure Policy and shall require the prior approval of the contracting officer and foreign disclosure officer. It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide evidence of any such agreement and/or license to this office for review and this shall be verified prior to release of any controlled documents.

Prior to release of any control document under this solicitation, the contractor must acknowledge its responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations (including the obligation, under certain circumstances, to obtain an export license prior to the release of technical data within or outside the United States) and agree that it will not disseminate any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations. It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide this certification and/or proof of a current approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act. Upon verification of your status and acknowledgement, the requested documents will be provided.

No telephone requests for the draft solicitation/RFP or attachments associated with the draft solicitation/RFP will be accepted, no written requests, other than request for the attachments and no hard copies will be mailed.  The Government welcomes any preliminary comments, questions and recommendation in regard to the Draft solicitation/RFP and associated attachments.  All final comments, questions and recommendations should be submitted by 21 July 2008.  Written comments, questions and recommendation as well as firms interested in obtaining the attachments shall submit a written request for the attachments through Linda Tome at: linda.tome@navy.mil or Tracy Medford at: tracy.medford@navy.mil. Companies must officially request the controlled documents in writing. To validate the document release, this request must include the potential Offeror’s company name, mailing address, email address (if available), point of contact, phone number, current CAGE number, Central Contractor Registration number. The written request must include acknowledgement of the contractor’s responsibility under the U.S. export contract laws and regulations. For any foreign firm, the request must include proof of a current and applicable approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act if applicable. 

Upon verification of your status as a current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractor and acknowledgement of your responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations, approved authorization confirmation to receive the requested documents will be provide.  Upon release of the draft RFP, the documents will be provided.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  Registration in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will be a prerequisite for receiving an authorization for release of the controlled documents and award.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information on the CCR.  Refer to the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.

Any questions about this announcement shall be submitted to the following:  linda.tome@navy.mil or at Naval Air Systems Command, Building 2272, Room 453, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Attn:  Linda Tome, AIR-2.4.4.3.1, Patuxent River, MD  20670-1547.

<DESC>The goal of this DHS Science & Technology research program is to develop algorithms and/or analytical tools that will assist investigators of bioterrorism events by providing precision and statistical power to inferences concerning the degree of relatedness among organisms or samples used in a bioterrorist event.  The focus of this effort will be on research in the areas microbial ecology, population dynamics, host-pathogen interaction. genetic stability, statistical inference, and match criteria for the following select agents:  Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Clostridium botulinum, Francisella tularensis, Brucella sp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei.  The objectives include:
1.  Improving our understanding of the population genetics of these pathogens to include research on genome stability, host preferences and interactions, genetic mobility of virulence factors, polymorphic sites, mutational hot spots, geographical distribution, microbial ecology, pathogen lifecycles, natural reservoirs, effects of host - pathogen interaction, etc.
2.  Improving methods for determining rates of mutation and recombination of the pathogen genomes and the identification of adaptive mutations that can have forensic utility
3.  Establishing match criteria for discriminating "difference" or "sameness" in sample comparisons. Define the parameters for inclusion or exclusion in the context of a known sample and questioned sample.  This must be backed by statistical parameters for acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis
4.  Developing  efficient, economical, and statistically rigorous sampling strategies to acquire spatially referenced genetic information on reservoirs of these pathogens
5.  Developing bioinformatics-based analytical tools for supporting hypotheses testing regarding pathogen origin that go beyond current phylogeny-based inferential methods and can meet forensic (legal) admissibility requirements of relevance and reliability.

Multiple awards are anticipated under this BAA.  This BAA has a registration process -- please see Section IV of the BAA.  Prospective Offerors must ensure that they allow sufficient time to complete the registration and submission process.


**Due to the current maintenance and unavailability of the HSARPABAA.com site, please submit white papers in accordance with the established deadline of 4:30 pm (Local Eastern Time) Monday, May 19, 2008 to the following email address:  baa08-04@dhs.gov.
