<DESC>The United States Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501(a), Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements based on proprietary issues. Due to proprietary knowledge and compatibility with current government owned property Gleason Research Associates (GRA), Incorporated is the only company capable of meeting the minimum government requirements for these services. Without continuity of service with GRA, the government would incur substantial duplication of cost to find and qualify a comparable contractor.   <br>  <br>  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Gleason Research Associates (GRA), Incorporated, 5537 Twin Knolls Road, Columbia, MD., 20145-3270 for the construction of physics-based engineering models and simulations in support of the Army Research Laboratory(ARL) in the form of a new Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type contract. The objective will consist of the construction and exploitation of physics-based engineering models and simulations of battlefield protective systems working against threats to blue forces (including APS and other potential protective systems that can't be categorized as either traditional armor or APS).   <br>  <br> This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, only if received by the closing date and time of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   <br>  <br>  <br> Responses to this notice are due on or before 10/18/2014 AT 12:59AM Mountain Standard Time (MST) by email at jessica.r.camunez.civ@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> Point of Contact for this notice is Jessica Camunez, (575) 678-8283, jessica.r.camunez.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br>

<DESC>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain an A/B MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program.
<p>The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS. The Contractor shall perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of Medicare services, both institutional and professional, both in-patient (Part A) and out-patient (Part B) for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, as well as CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare FFS program.</p>
<p>The Medicare FFS program has complex legal, policy, and operating environments. The Contractor shall be familiar with, utilize and interact with all pertinent CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will coordinate its activities not only with CMS, but must also work with a broad range of Federal, State, and Local government agencies, CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders in the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction, and will perform all standard or otherwise required editing with respect to these claims to determine whether they are complete and should be paid. An edit is the logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review. Contractors must be able to determine the need for locality-driven edits in their jurisdiction, as well as those included in the Standard and Supplemental systems, and to develop the logic for those local coverage determinations.</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also operates a provider customer service program and conducts a variety of Medicare provider and supplier outreach and response services, such as education regarding Medicare rules and regulations, billing procedures and answering telephone and written inquiries. The Contractor will also operate Medicare's provider and supplier toll-free lines across the country to respond to a wide-range of questions. Home Health and Hospice Services (HH+H) will be provided by the Jurisdiction 15 contractor for the following areas: Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Further, the Contractor conducts redeterminations on appeals of claims, responds to complex beneficiary inquiries referred to from the Beneficiary Contact Centers, performs Medical Review on selected claims, makes coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local area, and conducts rigorous quality control on the tens of millions of claims processed each year. The Contractor shall receive and review over five hundred Change Requests issued by CMS each year to modify the systems and services offered by Medicare, determine the impact of the Change Requests on the Contractors processes and systems, and implements these changes in the timeframes specified in the Change Requests.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction 15 (which includes the states Kentucky and Ohio) on or about August 4, 2014. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is October 4, 2014 with an anticipated award date of June 1, 2015.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong><br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E156, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES<br /><strong><br />Description<br /></strong><br />National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Pathology plans to procure on a sole source basis a reagent rental service from Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. a member of the Roche Group, 1910 E. Innovation Park Drive, Tucson, AZ 857655.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501- (a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System code is 325414 and the business size standard is 500 Employees. <br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity contract.<br /><br />The period of performance of the award will be for five (5) years after the date of award.<br /><br />It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. <br /><br />The Laboratory of Pathology has a need to provide immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization assays on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded and frozen tissue sections from patients enrolled on clinical trials in the NCI and other Institutes. Immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization is a widespread and accepted technique used in nearly every diagnostic, surgical pathology laboratory and in research laboratories throughout the world. These assays have become an essential part of cancer diagnosis and have an equally important role in the diagnosis of many infectious diseases.<br /><br />The laboratory currently has four (4) Ventana Medical Systems (VMS) Benchmark XT immunostainers that require proprietary reagents from VMS. The use of the Ventana automated immunostainers has allowed the laboratory to provide a high volume clinical service and offer a full menu of specialized tests. Approximately &frac34; of the laboratory's slide volume is run on these systems, and over 150 different antibodies have been validated and optimized on these systems at considerable expense. <br /><br />At the same time, the current automated Benchmark XT systems are approximately seven years old and over that time improvements in the equipment have been made by the company and the XT is being replaced by the Benchmark Ultra. For these reasons, the NCI plans to upgrade the current automated stainers to the next generation Benchmark Ultra systems. These newer models offer a number of advantages, better control over the staining conditions, and the ability to use the machine in single slide mode, rather than in a batch mode allowing continuous initiation of staining as needed. The current Benchmark XTs and the proposed new generation Benchmark Ultras use the same reagents, and would allow a smooth transfer of the clinical workload without any disruptive interruptions for lengthy revalidations. The new systems use the same chemistries and the NCI will be able to seamlessly export current standard operating procedures to the upgraded Benchmark Ultra systems. <br /><br />The NCI has developed and optimized standard operating procedures (SOPs) for over 150 antibodies on the Benchmark systems. Conversion to another platform would be difficult, costly, and inefficient. The development of standard operating procedures and interpretations of staining requires extensive validation and accumulated experience with particular reagents and the particular staining platform being used. Conversion to a new platform would be both an enormous undertaking, both a burden to the technicians and pathologists, and not in the interest of NIH patients.<br /><br />Ventana Medical Systems shall upgrade the Government owned Benchmark XTs to the new generation Benchmark Ultras in exchange for purchase of the reagents and supplies that are needed to operate the systems, and can only be purchased from Ventana Medical Systems. The reagents and materials shall be used primarily to support the clinical mission of the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI, and secondarily to support its research mission.<br /><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote for the Government to consider. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 11 AM EST, on October 17, 2014. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed to<br />240-276-5401 or emailed to Terry Galloway, Contracting Officer via electronic mail at terry.galloway@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) through sam.gov. Reference: N02RC42656-85 on all correspondence.

<DESC><strong><br />Agency/Office:<br /></strong>National Institutes of Health
<p><strong><br />Location:<br /></strong>National, Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Rockledge Dr. Bethesda Maryland</p>
<p><strong>Title:<br /></strong>Dental and oral medicine support for Sjogren's syndrome clinic</p>
<p><strong>Description(s):<br /></strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive, sole source basis to Dr. Margaret Grisius, 7645 Buford Dr., Mclean, VA, 22102, to provide dental and oral medicine support for Sjogren's syndrome, for the NIDCR.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The Molecular Physiology and Therapeudics Branch (MPTB) pursues a comprehensive bench-to-bedside program to understand the molecular basis of salivary gland function and dysfunction and to develop strategies for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of salivary gland diseases. Clinical and translational studies focus on mechanisms of, and therapies for, salivary gland dysfunction caused by head and neck irradiation and diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome. The branch has need of a part time dentist with experience in Oral Health and Sjogren's syndrome to participate in existing Sjogren protocols.</p>
<p><strong>The contractor shall: </strong></p>
<p>- Consult eight (8) to no more than twelve (12) hours per week;<br /><br />- Conduct oral medicine evaluations, including screening examinations, saliva collection, labia minor salivary gland biopsies and other examinations and procedures required by the current and future SSC protocols;<br /><br />- Report all findings to the Chief of the SSC assuring the best patient care and alerting him of any complications;<br /><br />- Produce a computerized record of the evaluations and procedures required by the medical records department, clinical center, NIH;<br /><br />- Notify the Chief of the SSC and the Research Nurse Coordinator two (2) weeks in advance of any conflicts preventing consultation on a scheduled day.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Sole Source Justification:<br /></strong><br />The sole source justification is based on the fact that Dr. Margaret Grisius has been performing this work for the past eleven (11) years for the NIDCR under protocol number DE000704-08 MPTB and under previous PO # HHSN268201400027P; it would be detrimental to the continuity of the research if another contractor were to take over the project. Dr. Grisius's experience and involvement in the research is invaluable to the MPTB and as such is irreplaceable; removal of Dr. Grisius would disrupt eleven (11) years of data gathering and patient relationships. Based on these facts, Dr. Grisius is the only vendor who can continue these services without interruption of current progress.</p>
<p>The Period of Performance will be 1 (one) year with three (3) option years.<br />Base: October 16th, 2014 - October 15th, 2015 <br />Option Year 1: October 16th, 2015 - October 15th, 2016<br />Option Year 2: October 16th, 2016 - October 15th, 2017<br />Option Year 3: October 16th, 2017 - October 15th, 2018</p>
<p>The delivery point is The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) Code is 621210, size standard $7M, Office of Dentists. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-76 (August 2014).</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by October 8th, 2014 at 9:00am Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC><p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Human Systems Division (AFLCMC/WNU), Wright Patterson Air Force Base is conducting market research to identify companies that may possess the capabilities and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements for Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) for the United States Air Force. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a genuine capability to fulfill this requirement. The intent of this notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining the appropriate acquisition decision for the procurement. A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to full and open competition, based on response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers. This is not a request for proposals, and the Government will not pay for information received. Companies may be contacted if we need further information to fully understand the marketplace. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps (FBO) site for additional information pertaining to this Sources Sought. Any information provided in response to this RFI will be used for informational purposes only and will not be returned.</p>
<p><br />Note that, if there is sufficient demonstrated interested and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and what type of businesses will be used for subcontracting (other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business (HUBZone). Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Note that, if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought is strictly voluntary. This Sources Sought does not constitute a Request For Proposal or an Invitation for Bid. Sources Sought issuance does not restrict the Government's ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Performance Requirements:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The objective of the Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Block 2 program is to manufacture, field, and sustain a laser eye protection system for aircrew members. Block 2 ALEP provides protection against laser devices/systems in combat and training situations while minimizing visual acuity degradation and is compatible with current Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE). Block 2 is highly specialized equipment in that it incorporates state-of-the-art filter and dye technologies. The Block 2 system must provide laser protection as well as visual performance for day and night operations and also be compatible with the Night Vision Goggles (NVG), Scorpion Helmet Mounted Integrated Targeting system (HMIT), and Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) systems. The Block 2 system shall not consist of more than a day and night variant, shall not include specialized test/maintenance equipment, and shall not require an increase in manpower for maintenance/sustainment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Force is looking to identify firms with the capabilities to build and deliver 11,805 Block 2 ALEP production units. This effort shall include all management and technical support, quality assurance, planning, material and production support, and facilities for this production. Block 2 performance specifications are classified and requests must be submitted to the contracting officer along with evidence of the required facility and personnel security clearances at or above the secret level. The effort will be production ready only; no developmental efforts will be considered. Product needs to be delivery ready by October 2015. Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM)/published price list, delivery timeframes, and capability statements.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vendor/Manufacturer Qualification Requirements: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Due to the complexity and criticality of this requirement, only manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the government for the spectacle can be considered approved sources for this item. The vendor's LEP device shall satisfy and meet all thresholds contained in the ALEP Block 2 performance specifications which include laser protection, optical qualities, visual performance, durability, and environmental requirements. The vendor shall provide test data that demonstrates physical compatibility with the aircrew population for frame compatibility (form/fit/function) with flight equipment (helmet/oxygen mask/headsets/visors/etc), NVG, HMIT, and JSAM. The vendor shall provide test data that verifies visual compatibility for in-cockpit and out-of-cockpit environments (including displays and emergency/warning lights) for the United States Air Force (USAF) transport, fighter, and rotary wing aircraft. The vendor shall provide results of ground evaluations to verify the maintenance concept, fitting procedures, in-cockpit pre-flight checks, and aircrew acceptance. The vendor shall provide results of operations test with a variety of USAF transport, fighter, and rotary wing aircraft. The vendor shall provide results of flight evaluations to verify operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness with USAF transport, fighter, and rotary wing aircraft. The vendor shall provide manufacturing assessment results in the form of yield/scrap rates for the production processes to demonstrate an affordable, robust, and viable manufacturing capability.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM)/published price list along with capability statements for aircrew laser eye protection as a complete unit or as separate components. The manufacturer must be able to produce the spectacles without additional technical data from the government. </strong></p>

<DESC>The US Army is looking to increase the power efficiency of its tactical networks. Further the Army would like to be able to leverage the tremendous power of commercial smart devices (phones, tablets, etc) to rapidly deploy more efficient information exchange capabilities to the Soldier, dismounted and in small units.   Key to this is the ability to adapt and leverage commercial  quote mark green communications quote mark  and military research and product development for greater power efficiency in a tactical environment.  <br>  <br> To realize this vision CERDEC S&TCD is interested in working with industry to investigate the current limitations of power-efficient hardware components, waveforms, networks, applications, and soldier interface technology and to develop solutions that both solve these deficiencies on today's handheld and manpack soldier radio systems but also can be introduced in the near-term (e.g. through software only updates) and deployed in the mid and far term via the Joint Capabilities Identification and Development (JCID) process, into future soldier radio and related electronics acquisitions and releases. <br>  <br> Current soldier radio systems were not designed for minimum thermal signature, power efficiency, or low total energy consumption per mission.  The commercial initiatives in end-user battery efficiency have been accompanied by low power radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), System-on-Chip (SoC), and digital signal processing (DSP) architectures in combination with improvements in waveforms and networking architecture.  Commercial wireless systems designs recently have been driven by the fact that the largest single operating expense (OPEX) in radio access networks is the electrical power.  The Joint Capabilities Integration Development (JCID) requirements process has emphasized soldier tactical communications capability for a given battery life and therefore has not specifically leveraged commercial technologies for the reduction of energy footprint for soldier radio tactical use. Although there are a few commercial wireless devices such as cell phones that have been deployed to theater in soldier information systems, these systems generally do not address the full range of requirements of handheld or manpack soldier radios.  Further, commercial systems rely on commercially allocated spectrum and do not provide the flexibility to operate in bands available to the Army. Most of these solutions rely on commercial components and provide little to no ability to protect the communications against high power interference, relying instead on fixed cellular infrastructure to control power to manage interference.  Commercial systems do not address intentional interference nor malicious RF jamming. <br>  <br> Contractual questions may be directed to Contracting Officer,  <br> David Greaves, at e-mail: David.a.greaves4.civ@mail.mil,  <br> or  <br> Contract Specialists, Pierre Beljour, at e-mail: pierre.r.beljour.civ@mail.mil; Oladayo Kaka, at email: Oladayo.a.kaka.civ@mail.mil

This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotation, or an indication the Government will contract for the services contained herein. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 811219- Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance; Small Business Size Standard is $20.5 million.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) and the Arkansas Regional Laboratory of the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ARL/ORA) are located at the Jefferson Laboratories of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Jefferson, Arkansas, approximately 35 miles south of Little Rock and 28 miles north of Pine Bluff. NCTR is an internationally recognized FDA research center that conducts toxicological research studies and other research activities designed to support the FDA's mission to protect the public's health. NCTR investigators partner with researchers elsewhere in the FDA as well as other government agencies, industry, and academia. NCTR is comprised of six research divisions and has facilities including: 132 general or special purpose research laboratories; animal facilities, including rodent facilities accommodating conventional housing, a specific pathogen free rodent production colony, isolators for germ-free rodents, and quarantine; a non-human primate research center; a zebrafish production facility; a phototoxicology research center; an imaging center including microPET, MRI, and CT scanner; a nanotechnology core facility; and an inhalation toxicology facility. ARL is an ORA field laboratory with Food Chemistry, Pesticide, and Microbiology laboratories tasked with analyzing a wide variety of samples from foods and cosmetics. Although much of the scientific equipment at the Jefferson Laboratories complex is covered under manufacturer's service agreements, many critical items are not. In addition, some research projects require specialized items that must be designed and fabricated to order. This on-site service contract continues to be required to provide maintenance, repair, and fabrication of scientific equipment that must remain in operating condition for continuous use in research and testing facilities. On-site laboratory equipment maintenance, repair, and fabrication services for NCTR have been obtained through contracts since 1977.</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters, anticipates a release of a solicitation, titled Ultra-lightweight Core Materials for Efficient Load-Bearing Composite Sandwich Structures, as an Appendix to the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) NASA Research Announcement (NRA), titled Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion - 2015 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2015), on or about October 17, 2014. Once the Appendix is posted, complete details (to include due dates) can be accessed via the following steps: <p> 1. Open the NSPIRES homepage at <A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/">http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ </A>     <p> 2. Select "Solicitations" <p> 3. Select "Open Solicitations <p> 4. Select "Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion - 2015 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2015) NNH15ZOA001N <p> 5. Select List of Open Program Elements <p> 6. Select Game Changing Development (GCD) NNH15ZOA001N-15GCD-C1 <p> 7. Select Game Changing Development (GCD) NNH15ZOA001N-15GCD-C1 (ULW Core) under Announcement Documents <p> The Government plans to conduct a phased acquisition involving a progressive competitive down-selection process (see 1817.7301-5). Competition for subsequent phases will build on the results of the previous phases. Phase I is the Manufacturing Feasibility phase with an expected duration of up to 13 months. Phase II is the Scale-up and Test Article Fabrication phase with an expected duration of up to 18 months. <p> The award criteria for subsequent phases will include demonstrated completion of specified previous phase requirements. The Government expects that only the initial phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase(s). Proposals for the subsequent phase(s) will be requested from these contractors. The Government does not intend to issue a new, formal solicitation for subsequent phases(s). Request letters will be issued for each subsequent phase to provide guidance on proposal content and evaluation criteria. Each subsequent phase will be synopsized. Notwithstanding the expectation that only the initial phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase(s), proposals from all responsible sources submitted by the specified due date will be considered. In order to contend for the second phase awards, prospective offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the prior phase awardees, documentation equivalent to the Phase I requirements, and provide the required Phase I test samples for government testing. Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity, provide documentation on the Phase I requirements, and provide acceptable test samples may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award. <p> Appendix NNH15ZOA001N-15GCD-C1 seeks proposals for the maturation and development of scalable methods to manufacture ultra-lightweight core materials as lower mass alternatives to honeycomb or foam cores in composite sandwich structures. <p> The development of advanced manufacturing techniques has led to the production of lightweight, hierarchical structures with the potential for use as lower mass alternatives to conventional core components in composite sandwich structures. NASA is interested in scaling up manufacturing processes to produce ultra-lightweight core materials that could be used to produce large-scale composite sandwich structures.  The envisioned development effort would demonstrate that materials are a cost-effective and lighter weight alternative to conventional core materials.  The overall goal of the Appendix is to develop and demonstrate scalable and cost-effective manufacturing approaches to produce ultra-lightweight core materials both as flat panels and curved structures.  The resultant structures will have half or less the areal density of conventional honeycomb cores, while retaining equivalent, or better, mechanical properties. <p> All proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES by an authorized organizational representative (AOR).

<DESC>********************************************************************************* <br> THIS NOTIFICATION SUPRESEDES PEO STRI BOP SOURCES SOUGHT STOC II-14-KOP-0016. ALL INTERESTEPARTIES MUST RESPOND TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTIFICATION EVEN IF THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY RESPONDED TO THE STOC II-14-KOP-16. <br> ********************************************************************************* <br> TITLE: Sources Sought for the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Re-compete of the Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT). <br>  <br> PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is seeking capability information from industry for consideration during development of an acquisition strategy to obtain/ validate necessary data required to continue the Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT) analysis, design, development, integration, testing, security accreditation, fielding, installation, modifications, system support, training support, and sustainment for the Product Manager Warrior Training Integration Office (PdM WTI), a member of  Project Manager Constructive Simulation (PM ConSIM).   <br>  <br> BACKGROUND:  <br>  <br> The IEWTPT program is a Non-system Training Aids, Device, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) Program of Record (POR) that enables proficiency training for Military Intelligence Occupational Specialties, including but not limited to, collectors and analysts to exploit intelligence data in training events, just as they would in  quote mark real world quote mark  operations and supports the US Army Military Intelligence (MI) Training Strategy. IEWTPT fills a military intelligence (MI) specific war fighting function training gap at Home-station, Combat Training Centers (CTC's), and Reserve and National Guard locations supporting sustainment of critical individual, collective, and crew tasks/ skills. It is the key simulation enabler for MI personnel training currently supporting All Source, Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Signal Intelligence (SIGINT), and Geographical (GEOINT) and potentially Measurement and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT), Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), and Cyber Intelligence. IEWTPT trains/ supports collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination (PED) / cross-queuing of multi-discipline intelligence data supporting mission command and mission execution training events. IEWTPT provides War fighting Commanders at all echelons the ability to train the Intelligence War fighting Function (IWF) based on accurately portraying the operational environment by simulating the necessary attributes of that environment and stimulating MI war fighting equipment  where system operators and analysts are able to conduct their tasks and synchronize their Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets (in a training environment) to exploit training events intelligence data and provide the commander with required, timely, accurate, and executable intelligence information and products. <br>  <br> IEWTPT has three (3) primary components: Technical Control Cell (TCC) [SECRET to TS/SCI operations], Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Control Cell (HCC) [UNCLASS to SECRET operations], and Simulation Interfaces [aka. Target Signature Arrays (TSA's). IEWTPT operates in conjunction with a number of complementary systems to include but not limited to: DCGS-A, TiGR, CPOF, CHARCS, TGS, PROPHET, etc. <br>   <br> This effort is for continued analysis, design, development, integration, testing, security accreditation, fielding, installation, modifications, system support, training support, and sustainment of the IEWTPT capability - including associated simulation interfaces - and the Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Control Cell (HCC) component of IEWTPT.  The current Technical Control Cell (TCC) is a processor  quote mark server stack quote mark  that creates a robust, realistic relevant target environment for high-fidelity training on Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems supporting the intelligence disciplines: All Source, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), which includes Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronics Intelligence (ELINT); Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT);  Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence (CI/HUMINT); and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).  IEWTPT supports intelligence sustainment training in all disciplines by leveraging the Live, Virtual, Constructive - Gaming training environments capabilities and generating and providing simulation-based sensor data feeds indistinguishable from  quote mark real world quote mark  systems. IEWTPT is expected to transition to a cloud-based solution in the near future.  The TCC has three (3) enclaves: the Lower Enclave (LE) (SECRET collateral), the Cross Domain Solution (CDS) (a.k.a Data Diode), and the Upper Enclave (UE) (Top SECRET (TS)/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (SCI).  In addition to realistic simulation enhancements, it provides exercise control and support tools, scenario development capabilities, and AAR functions. The TCC has the capability to distribute the exercise simulations/ stimulation information to remote training locations via secure Army networks.  The current HCC is an interactive, avatar based simulator created for HUMINT Soldiers and used by multiple Army disciplines to sustain tactical questioning skills.  The soldier can run through any of the multiple scenarios available, questioning virtual humans in free flowing (non-scripted), realistic virtual environment in an attempt to extract mission-essential information.  The planning has begun for a cloud-based HCC capability.  The IEWTPT (in standard or tailored configuration) system is fielded to 27 CONUS and 6 OCONUS locations. <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:   <br>  <br> The Government anticipates an award in 3QFY16.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for Market Research purposes only. The Government is trying to determine the availability of certain Brand Name Components for upcoming acquisitions. No awards will be made from this Sources Sought Notice. No solicitation will be available at this time. However, responses to this Sources Sought Notice may be used to determine appropriate acquisition strategies for future acquisitions.
<p>The Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District intends to solicit and award construction projects for a customer of the Intelligence Community. The construction projects will be solicited competitively under future separate solicitations. These projects may include Brand Name only components, as described below, unless the results of these sources sought notification indicates otherwise.</p>
<p>This notification serves three purposes: (1) to notify potential offerors of the Government's intent to solicit a brand name only component under future construction projects; (2) to identify potential sources that can provide the brand name only item and/or equivalent; (3) notification of the Army's intent to contract sole source for a Brand Name Only, if the market is unable to provide 'equivalent' products.</p>
<p>The following items may be included in future solicitations as sole sources, if no sources are able to provide an equivalent system. In the event no equivalent equipment exists, the Brand Name Only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source." A subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) for sole sourcing the resultant product(s) or system(s) in the event an equivalent product is not submitted for consideration. In such instances, the brand name or equal component will be embedded in the construction project that will be issued competitively. Only that part of the project requiring brand name components will be sole source, if no sources are able to prove an equal product. The construction projects themselves will be competitively solicited.</p>

The LuxLink IRGP-7001 receiver is an optical repeater that is used to implement a drop-and-repeat time code distribution network. The LuxLink IRGM-8004 amplifier is a distribution amplifier (DA) that accepts an electrical unmodulated digital DCLS (Digital Current Level Shift) signal and Inter-Range Instrument Group (IRIG A through H input) for transferring standard format timing information. This amplifier unit produces four (4) individual electrical output signals for distribution over four (4) separate coaxial cables to other IRIG receivers.</p>
<p>7. NETWORK SWITCHES and ROUTERS: by CISCO Systems. This project requires network switches and routers to interface with the SCADA system components. The CISCO switch, Model WS-C2960, is an Intelligent Ethernet switch that is a fixed-configuration standalone device that provides desktop Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet connectivity for networks. The CISCO router, Model WS-3850-12S-E, currently offers superior 480 Gbps stacking bandwidth to meet NSAW network demand, including Gigabit desktop and wireless. The switch delivers advanced capabilities, such as a high-performance 24 and 48-port Gigabit Ethernet (GE) switch, 480 GB stacking, Power over Ethernet Plus, StackPower, and Flexible NetFlow on all ports. All new construction projects at NSAW facilities are using CISCO System networking equipment for compatibility and reliability.</p>

<SUBJECT>United States Coast Guard Evaluation of Infrared (IR) Detection Equipment for Ice Rescue Teams Market Research
<SOLNBR>HSCG32-14-I-R00022
<RESPDATE>110314
<ARCHDATE>10032016
<CONTACT>Helen R Nelson, Phone 860-271-2843, Email helen.r.nelson@uscg.mil
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess technologies that would increase the ability of Ice Rescue Teams to leverage the infrared (IR) spectrum during Search and Rescue (SAR) operations on the frozen waterways of the Great Lakes. As the primary agency for maritime Search and Rescue in the United States, the Coast Guard endeavors to minimize the loss of life and injury by rendering aid to persons in distress in the maritime environment.
<p><br />The Coast Guard Research and Development Center (RDC) is conducting market research to identify technologies that are suitable for conducting IR searches on foot for persons on frozen waterways. The parameters include detection capabilities of one mile, and recognition capabilities at one-half mile, and identification at approximately one-quarter mile by personnel on foot (monopod is possible). The parameters also include the need to function in extremely cold temperatures, be temporarily submersible, and function regardless of weather conditions or the time of day/night for IR detection.</p>
<p>This market research is intended to identify both operational and state-of-the-art technologies as potential IR technologies for use in the maritime ice rescue environment. "Operational" in this context refers to existing technologies and equipment that are currently used in commercial and/or Government (law enforcement or Department of Defense) application, while "state-of-the-art" in this context refers to proven and near-proven technologies that can be developed for operational use in the next 30 to 36 months.</p>
<p>The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but desires information on uncooled imaging devices with supporting robustness to support use in a winter, ice-covered waterway environment. The USCG RDC would like to leverage existing devices to take advantage of lower costs from higher yields; therefore, all information supplied in a response to this RFI should represent current production devices. It is also desired that these production capabilities represent a product that will not become obsolete before October 1, 2025. This effort will afford the Coast Guard the capability for employing smaller, lighter, and cheaper imaging infrared devices as they become available.</p>
<p>You are invited to respond with information to assist the RDC with its market research by identifying potential sources of IR technologies. Such technologies would also be appropriate for use to search for persons in the water (overboard) in distress, or deployed onboard life raft systems, recreational vessels and commercial vessels, if carried by Coast Guard/Government vessels in hazardous conditions.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUESTED <br /><br />The following information is requested for each proposed solution. If multiple solutions are presented by the same entity, the information should be specific to each solution. <br /><br />A. Equipment specifications (Height, weight, length, etc);</p>
<p>B. Equipment capabilities (Visibility, operational life, etc);</p>
<p>C. Acquisition cost (Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) and Procurement Lead Time);</p>
<p>D. If applicable, Battery life (hours of uninterrupted use at maximum intensity);</p>
<p>E. Life-Cycle Cost Parameters: Mean Time Between Overhaul (MTBO), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), Planned Maintenance, Training;</p>
<p>F. Operational Applications (Maritime, terrestrial environments, etc);</p>
<p>G. Space, Weight and Storage condition, and transportation requirements;</p>
<p>H. With respect to NAICS code 541330, please identify if you are a small or large business.</p>
<p>RESPONDING TO THIS MARKET RESEARCH <br /><br />It is desired that responses to this RFI address all of the topics discussed in the &lsquo;SPECIFIC TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUESTED.' Topics may be combined or treated individually. However, if information is not available for some of the topic areas, your submission is still of interest.</p>
<p>When addressing each RFI topic, please include the following information in the English language:<br /><br />&bull; A one-page cover letter that provides a brief summary of the response and indication if supporting documentation is included.</p>
<p>&bull; Descriptive material that addresses all areas of information requested by this RFI including the section "SPECIFIC TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUESTED." If pre-developed marketing or technical information and specification sheets are provided, please include additional information, as necessary to "fill the gaps" between pre-developed material and the information required. Digital photographs, line drawings, and illustrations that clarify descriptive text are encouraged.</p>
<p>&bull; If available, any digital photos and/or digital videos of the device or technology in operation.<br /><br />This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>This Sources Sought and is not a request for proposals nor does it constitute a statement of a current government requirement. The anticipated procurement is for a Design-Build Construction Contract that will provide for the Repair and Alteration of a waterline and the demolition and replacement of a bridge located at USCG Base Kodiak, AK.
<p>This construction effort is anticipated to be a small business set-aside, but all interested parties are encouraged to submit capability statements.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this acquisition will result in one (1) firm fixed price contract. The anticipated magnitude of the awarded contract is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. The projected contract's period of performance is estimated to be 730 calendar days.</p>
<p>The successful offeror will be required to provide all labor, material, supplies, transportation, supervision, and all other necessary items to demolish an existing waterline and bridge and construct a new replacement for this infrastructure as a Design-Build delivery method in accordance with Government provided construction documents and specifications.</p>
<p>The project includes design and construction of all site improvements and infrastructure required to replace approximately 9,000 LF of waterline from the Water Treatment Plant to a point immediately downstream of the Buskin River waterline bridge crossing. The Buskin River waterline bridge crossing will be replaced and demolition of an abandoned bridge crossing over the Buskin River.</p>
<p>Project Background:<br />Base Kodiak operates and maintains a Public Domestic Water System regulated by the State of Alaska. The Buskin River waterline and the bridge for the waterline crossing the Buskin River were built in the late 1950's by the US Navy. This section of waterline (approximately 8,400 LF of buried 16" ductile iron) and the Buskin River Bridge crossing (steel construction) are the critical components supporting the entire public water distribution system for Base Kodiak.</p>
<p>Segregation and management of the water distribution system is problematic. The bridge is not built to seismic standards and structural components are significantly deteriorated. In addition, due to the bridge's low elevation at the river crossing, the bridge and the main distribution waterline attached to the bridge are subject to potential damage from Buskin River flooding events, ice jams and debris from high water events.</p>
<p>The age of the pipeline and its critical nature make this a high priority project. Base Kodiak has only 1 to 2 days of water storage downstream of this waterline/bridge infrastructure. In the event of failure, on-island resources do not exist for emergency repairs to this system. Any failure would result in an extended outage, severely impacting operations at Base Kodiak, including quality of life for 406 family housing units.</p>
<p>Due to the highly regulated nature of public water systems, construction and maintenance activities require careful coordination, planning, and design. The Annual Water Quality Report 2012 indicates that Base Kodiak's water is in compliance with all of the drinking-water standards; however, vulnerability was assessed as a risk due to potential infiltration of contaminants into the water stream. There are two known contaminated sites located near the project alignment.</p>
<p>The Buskin River Bridge #2 presents a public safety threat and has been condemned and is currently scheduled for demolition. The Buskin River Bridge No. 2 was built in 1950 and is approximately 178 feet long and 20 feet wide and is supported approximately 18 feet above the Buskin River. The bridge is constructed of wood decking and rails and is supported with steel beams. It has a total of 10 spans of steel beams and a wooden bulkhead on each side. This bridge is located at latitude 57.7559 north, longitude 152.5017 west and is located adjacent to the Kodiak Airport on an abandoned portion of the Chiniak Highway to the north side of the end of Runway 11. The bridge steel support beams also cause the buildup of debris in the Buskin River.</p>
<p>Desired capabilities and qualifications include; <br />- Expertise in Design-Build construction related services. <br />- Experience working in remote locations with harsh seasonal weather conditions.<br />- Evidence demonstrating ability to work on projects of similar size, scope, magnitude, and complexity as the work described above. <br />- Bonding capability up to $7,000,000.00.</p>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of the Lifecell Contour Alloderm Tissue Implants for Breast Reconstruction Surgery at WPAFB Medical Treatment Facility (MTF). The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106 (b)(1).<br /><br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339113, Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing. Size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />The proposed source is Lifecell Corporation, 1 Millennium Way , Branchburg, NJ 08876-3876. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within one (1) day of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires the Lifecell Contour Alloderm Tissue Implants for breast reconstruction surgery to be performed at the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) at Wright Patterson AFB (WPAFB). The doctor has exhausted all other options for these patients and has determined that the Contour Alloderm Tissue Implants are the only treatment that allows optimized contoured fit for breast reconstruction for some patients. The surgeon has trained using the Lifecell Contour Alloderm Tissue Implants and if these items are not used the surgery would need to be sent off base at a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.<br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM at 866-606-8220. SAM website: www.SAM.gov<br /><br />Any information should be e-mailed to emmeline.spaulding@us.af.mil no later than one (1) day of this notice. Only inquiries/Information received by this date will be considered.<br /><br />Be advised that all correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Lifecell Contour Alloderm Tissue Implants." Note that email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter emails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the email may not get through the email filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB.

<CONTACT>Benjamin Shih
<DESC>Notice of Sole Source Award
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Administration and Resource Management (OARM), Safety, Health, and Environmental Management Division (SHEMD) awarded a sole source, fixed-price software maintenance purchase order to AT/Scan LTD, d/b/a Vertere Inventory Control Systems, 335E Centreville Road, Warwick, Rhode Island, on October 14, 2014 in the amount of approximately $45,150.00. The period of performance is expected to be from October 14, 2014 to September 30, 2015.  
The justification is as follows: The Vertere Inventory Manager software is an automated Web/PC-based inventory management system. Vertere Inventory Manager comes preloaded with over 5000 J.T. Baker chemical records. The software is equipped with a bar coding capability using a bar code scanner to read J.T. Baker labels, which eliminates the need for keyboard entry of product information. In addition, Vertere Inventory Manager includes J.T. Baker health and safety information and the SAF-T-DATATm ratings and recommended personal protective equipment.
Currently, the Vertere Inventory Manager System is an integral part of 21 laboratory and facility sites that maintain and use hazardous chemicals in the completion of EPA's analytical and research mission. The chemical inventory management software has a unique design, performance, and quality specifications that are essential to EPA's particular research protocol, and analytical, and safety, health and environmental compliance needs that are not available in comparable products. This proprietary software is only supplied and maintained by Vertere Inventory Control Systems, and offers site-specific solutions through its design. The Vertere Inventory Manager software's web-based system allows each EPA site and the headquarter group greater efficiency in retrieving data on the use and storage of hazardous chemicals. Additionally, it eliminates unnecessary purchases and waste disposal cost.  Vertere is the sole owner of this Inventory Control System and retains all the rights to  its applications, including the distribution rights, managing and support.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response for future consideration, which if received within five days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the Contracting Officer Ben Shih at shih.benjamin@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Command Headquarters intends to authorize Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), as an incumbent contractor for task order W91QUZ-06-D-0018, NS01 - to acquire NetApp SAN appliance and associated hardware on a brand name / sole source basis. The authorization to acquire this hardware on behalf of the Government is in support of a modification to the accredited DIEST platform and incidental to the services already being performed by CSC. This procurement is required in order to accommodate the use of fiber optic storage area network switches at customer hosted locations to transition systems to the NEDC. The NetApp system will support data spree data transfers as well as provide data at rest, when the system is powered off.  The brand name specification of NetApp is required and no other substitutes will suffice. NetApp is currently supported with an Authorization to Operate (ATO) and was selected based on fitness for the application and/or compatibility with the current infrastructure. The use of a non NetApp product would invalidate all integration and testing results for the current infrastructure and require retesting, certification and re-integration in order to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not being introduced. Additionally, use of other products would carry a substantial cost and time delay to re-train the staff on their use and would incur significant costs in making the transition to new, untested products. Such delays would cause a negative impact in meeting the schedule for transition of the Saufley Systems.  This notice of intent is for informational purposes only and is not a request for quote. A determination by the government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the government. Questions by phone or fax will not be considered.  This is a modification to an order against an Indefinite-Delivery contract and FAR Part 16.5 applies.  The applicable NAICS Code is 517110 and the size standard is 1,500 employees. The point of contact for this announcement is Misty Ketron at misty.ketron@navy.mil. Requiring Activity: SPAWAR HQS Technical POC: John Mitchell FS Code: R425 Estimated Value: $133,827.55 Contracting Officer Name: Mary OHara Contract Specialist Name: Misty Ketron Contract Specialist Phone Number: 619-524-7394 Contract Specialist E-mail Address: misty.ketron@navy.mil Award Information Award Date: 09/16/2013 Award End Date: 04/13/2015 Contract Number: W91QUZ-06-D-0018, NS01 Company: Computer Sciences Corporation, LLC; CAGE CODE 52939; 3160 FAIRVIEW PARK DR FALLS CHURCH VA 22042-4516

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>Solicitation Number: FA6643-14-R-0030 - This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>This acquisition is a Sole Source Requirement to Unify, Inc. Cage Code 58MA2. The applicable NAICS code is 541511.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-76, Effective 25 Aug 2014.</p>
<p>The following clauses are applicable to this synopsis/solicitation: FAR 52.212-1 (Instructions to Offerors/Commercial Items) with addenda below, FAR 52.212-2 (Evaluation--Commercial Items) with addenda below, FAR 52.212-4 (Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items), and FAR 52.212-5 (Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items).</p>
<p>Addenda to FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors/Commercial Items (APR 2014)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the QCP draft as a requirement for technical review and acceptability as part of this RFP.</p>
<p>Addenda to FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Acceptability and Price.</p>
<p>i. Technical Acceptability - The contractor shall submit a Quality Control Plan (QCP) that includes, at a minimum, the performance standards identified in the table at PWS Paragraph 4.3 and the Contractor's approach to managing Quality Control, including proactive identification and mitigation of cost, schedule and quality issues, while ensuring the work products are technically sound.<br />ii. Price - The offeror's price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance. See paragraphs (A) and (B) below. Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be calculated in accordance with paragraph (C) below.</p>
<p>(A) Reasonableness: The existence of adequate price competition is expected to support a determination of reasonableness. Price analysis techniques may be used to further validate price reasonableness. If adequate price competition is not obtained or if price reasonableness cannot be determined using price analysis of Government obtained information, additional information in accordance with FAR 15.4 may be required to support the proposed price.</p>
<p>(B) Balance: Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items (CLINs) is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of proposal analysis techniques. The government shall analyze offers to determine whether there are unbalanced separately priced line items or sub-line items. Prices submitted will be compared and evaluated to assure that a logical progression exists as related to price and quantity changes within each offeror's response to the pricing structure in Schedule B. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>(C) Total Evaluated Price: A TEP will be used for evaluation purposes only and will be calculated as follows: An Offeror's total evaluated price will be determined by multiplying the Quantity identified in the Contract Line Item section of the solicitation by the Unit Price for CLINs 0001 thru 4028 to achieve the extended Amount for each CLIN. The extended Amounts for each CLIN will be added together for the total evaluated price of each Offeror.</p>
<p><br />Offeror must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items) with their offer.</p>
<p>The offeror is instructed to submit their proposal and all supporting documentation via email to the contracting officer referenced for this solicitation.</p>
<p>Payment will be made via Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) IAW DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (JUNE 2012).</p>
<p>The resulting contract will be awarded on an all or none basis. The contractor's proposal must include all items listed in this synopsis/solicitation.</p>

<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:<br />The Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan Programs (INL/AP) is part of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in the Department of State. The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State (DOS). INL/AP provides policy guidance and develops, executes and monitors programs to address the full range of counternarcotic issues as they relate to stabilization and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. INL has been engaged in an effort with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to ensure a comprehensive approach to the drug problem. The U.S. Counternarcotic Strategy for Afghanistan targets narcotics traffickers through interdiction, while also supporting agricultural development, eradication, demand reduction, public information, and rule of law programs. The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has been designated the lead agency within the DOS to hire, fund, and manage the Ministry of Counter Narcotics Advisor and Ministry of Interior Counternarcotic Division liaison.</p>
<p>PURPOSE <br />The Senior Counternarcotic (CN) Ministry Advisor is treated as a member of the inner staff of the Ministry of Counter Narcotics (MCN) and Ministry of Interior CN Division (MOI/CN), Kabul, Afghanistan. The Senior Counternarcotic Advisor provides expertise in a wide variety of settings, including internal U.S. Embassy and multi-national meetings, to assist the Government of Afghanistan in reaching its stated goals and objectives in advancing and reforming counternarcotic programs in Afghanistan.

<p>RELATIONSHIP<br />The Advisor will report to the Director of the INL Section at U.S. Embassy Kabul through the INL Kabul Counternarcotic Team Leader. Tasking will come from both INL/Kabul and INL's Afghanistan and Pakistan Program Office in Washington. The Advisor's actions, decisions and recommendations reviewed based on results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. The Advisor receives general policy guidance and direction, and works independently to further the mission of INL.</p>
<p>DUTIES &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES<br />&bull; Assist in strategic planning and implementing Afghan Government CN policy, with a special focus on improving and expanding U.S. supported programs, including (but not limited to) the Counternarcotic Police of Afghanistan, Ministry of Counter Narcotics Capacity Building, Good Performers Initiative (GPI), the Counter Narcotics Public Information Campaign (CNPI), the Annual Opium Survey project, and Governor Led Eradication.</p>
<p>&bull; Consult with and provide advice to senior ministry officials on capacity building, management, and oversight needs.</p>
<p>&bull; Inform the ministry officials of developments in U.S. CN policy and advise on its implications for GIRoA.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a continuous link between MCN or MOI and the INL Section of U.S. Embassy Kabul; submit regular written reports to INL Kabul on substantive CN issues and management issues.</p>
<p>&bull; Identify opportunities for GIRoA and USG assistance and collaboration, including opportunities to integrate counternarcotic elements, especially the CNPA, into existing development, rule of law and other projects.</p>
<p>&bull; Focus on long-term sustainment of CN law enforcement programs, systems, and institutions provided by foreign donors and the transfer of responsibility to the Government of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; Support the ministry in distinguishing between broad, policy-level objectives on CN matters and specific, programmatic actions that can be realistically achieved by the ministry within its existing or gradually-improving capacity, emphasizing the importance of both long-term planning as well as steady and incremental - rather than immediate - growth in programmatic oversight and implementation.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the formulation and implementation of policies/programs at the regional and local levels.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the ministry to streamline, clarify, and amplify public communication of its policies, programs, and achievements, and support the ministry in clarifying its goals for institutional training and capacity-building along these lines.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the formulation and implementation of policies/programs, including the 2012 National Drug Control Strategy revision.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the ministry in forging policy-level and programmatic linkages with other Afghan institutions involved in CN activities, including the Ministries of Agriculture, Public Health, and Reconstruction and Rural Development, and with the Independent Directorate for Local Governance.</p>
<p>&bull; Support and help advance the Ministry of Counter Narcotics' mandate, under Afghan law, to regularly receive, monitor, and evaluate statistics and data from all relevant government institutions regarding programs that support implementation of the National Drug Control Strategy, and, where possible, assist government institutions to improve such reporting to the Ministry of Counter Narcotics.<br />&bull; Build and maintain open lines of communication with Afghan, U.S., and international stakeholders on CN activities including: stakeholders from DEA, CENTCOM, other USG agencies, non-governmental organizations, the United Nations and other international organizations, ISAF, the United Kingdom Embassy, representatives of the U.S. military, and other coalition forces. Work collaboratively and effectively with senior leadership and colleagues from other countries, agencies, and departments to accomplish INL's goals and objectives.</p>
<p>&bull; Inform INL on current developments in a given portfolio that must be consulted in advance of important briefings, meetings, or presentations of new initiatives.</p>
<p>&bull; Produce a brief written weekly report on status of programs, activities, and initiatives to be disseminated via email to designated points of contact at INL Kabul, and INL/AP on a mutually agreed upon day of the week. Upon reporting to post, propose a format for this report, which should include, but is not limited to: recent and planned activities, accomplishments, challenges, proposed solutions, administrative issues, and upcoming schedule (to include TDYs and leave). Photographs may be included, as well.</p>
<p>COMPEXITY<br />Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of INL policies and programs, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated. Active planning involves anticipating future events and requirements, deciding or recommending what needs to be done, the people and other resources required, and the timing of the activities. <br />Operating within the country strategy, the Advisor will have ongoing opportunity to develop new ideas and approaches that impact on existing procedures and methods. The Advisor must absorb and understand a large volume of detailed information on policies and procedures for multiple disciplines. Within a loose framework, the Advisor will be responsible for meeting a series of mid-to-long term objectives through structuring work and resources. Often breaking new ground, this role will be highly complex and will require a highly developed analytical ability and judgment. The problems encountered in this position are often unique, highly complex, or conceptual. Covering a wide range of potentially conflicting issues, the Advisor must apply the highest analytical skill and judgment to determine the best solution from the range of possible alternatives. The work pattern will be typified by many different overlapping tasks with heavy disruption due to changes in priorities, external events, and other interruptions<br />A broad range of highly developed oral communication skills are required for this position. The Advisor will, at various times, be required to transmit routine information, discuss sensitive matters with tact and diplomacy, provide complex explanations, persuade and influence, give formal presentations, express care and compassion, provide reasoned arguments, and resolve conflicts without compromising the organization's position. Finally, the Advisor must exercise leadership by staff, in order to achieve objectives and get the job done well, quickly, and efficiently without recourse to close supervision or coercion.</p>
<p>SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS<br />The Advisor performs a broad range of tasks related to organizational control plan, process development, implementation and direction of a management control program encompassing the Bureau's international counter narcotics and law enforcement operations.</p>
<p>PERSONAL CONTACTS<br />The Advisor will interface primarily with mid and high-level officers inside the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and other international representatives at PRTs, civilian, and military platforms in Afghanistan.

Size and detail scupper, conductor heads, and downspouts based on the anticipated rain storm intensity and per Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors National Association (SMACNA) standards). Storm water is ponding at the lower roofs above the gymnasium. This is caused by blockage of the undersized through-wall scuppers (approximately 2-inch in diameter) as well as improper roof slopes. Undersized through-wall scupper were also observed at the gymnasium high roof and at the second floor roof. Undersized roof scuppers can easily get blocked and cause water to pond on the roof which will accelerate the deterioration of the roofing system as well as could cause damage to the building structural system and architectural finishes.<br /><br /></span>

<DESC>PLEASE REFER TO THE ATTACHED SOLICITATION FOR&nbsp;a&nbsp;Bench-top Inductively Coupled Plasma Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) System- BRAND NAME ONLY PerkinElmer Model NexION 350D.<br /><br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.
<p>THIS ACQUISITION IS 100% SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS DISTRIBUTORS (UNDER SBA CLASS WAIVER). The contractor shall be a small business under the applicable size standard (SEE ABOVE) and shall provide either its own product or that of another manufacturing or processing concern. See FAR 19.102(f)(4) for additional information.</p>
<p>CLASS WAIVER - CLASS WAIVER - SBA has granted a class waiver (effective effective 12/31/2013) of the nonmanufacturer rule for: "Not-portable, Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LS-MS) Systems, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Systems, Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) Systems, and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) Systems under Product Service Code (PSC) 6640 (Laboratory Equipment and Supplies), under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 (Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing)."</p>
<p>The basis for the waiver is that no small business manufacturers are manufacturing these classes of products to the Federal government. The effect of this waiver is to allow otherwise qualified small businesses to supply the products of any manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned (SDVO) small businesses or Participants in SBA's 8(a) Business Development (BD) Program.</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001 is a BRAND-NAME ONLY requirement. The instrument offered must be manufactured by PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc.</p>
<p>Brand-Name Only Justification:<br />PerkinElmer is the only commercial manufacturer of a bench-top quadrupole ICP-MS instrument meeting all the necessary performance criteria required by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The instrument system must have a multipole collision/reaction device (dual-channel) with Kinetic Energy Discrimination and be capable of measuring elemental and isotopic content with high speed, sensitivity and accuracy, capable of mitigating spectral interference in a wide variety of sample types, including samples of environmental, clinical, geological, and biological origin, be capable of interfacing with a wide range of selective separation and autosampler systems, and be capable of measuring nanoparticle size distribution in single particle ICP-MS (spICP-MS) mode. A system capable of rapid continuous data acquisition, data acquisition (dwell) times below 100 &micro;s, rapid quadrupole scan speeds (&gt;90,000 u/sec), and equipped with software tailored to spICP-MS analysis, including the capability to calculate transport efficiency, provide the number of particle events, provide the particle size, provide the particle size distribution, provide the particle number concentration, and provide the concentration of the ionic element fraction, is essential.</p>
<p>Procuring a bench-top ICP-MS with these capabilities are critical to NIST's efforts to develop tools to enable a science based risk assessment of the impact of nanomaterials on the environment and human health and safety. In addition, the ICP-MS system must be capable of being interfaced with commercially available selective separation systems. Due to space limitations, a bench-top model ICP-MS is required.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

                         CONTINUATION PAGE - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS


1.	In reference to Statement of Work A.4, 2. It is stated that contractor is required to terminally clean rooms upon completion. During my initial site visit the vacated room that we looked at had not been cleaned, therefore we assume that the rooms turned over to the contractor will not be as well. We typically clean rooms and mop the floors upon completion, then the VA will perform final cleaning. What is expected from the contractor in reference of "terminally cleaning"? Will we also need to clean the patient rooms to include existing conditions?
 
"	Rooms should be clear of construction debris and dust. The VA will not turn over additional rooms until rooms received from the contractor are ready for patient occupancy. 

2.	In reference to Statement of Work A.4, 2. It is stated that the contractor will receive a maximum of two rooms and a minimum of one room at sole discretion of the VA. It also indicates the turnover will allow the contractor to work in two rooms at a time with the exception of Rooms 614, 619, and 630. With this taken into consideration it looks like we would be looking at a total of ten mobilizations. Is that agreeable to the VA? My main concern here is the amount of mobilizations for the epoxy crew will have significant cost increases and I will need to know this in order to provide accurate pricing. 

"	Rooms 614, 619, and 630 do not share a common wall with other  patient rooms. The solicitation specifies that not more than two rooms will be turned over to the contractor at any given time. The layout of the work area and patient rooms is such that patient rooms share a common curtain wall in all cases other than what has been specified. This allows the contractor to work in two rooms at any given time. Rooms 614, 619,630 do not share a curtain wall with another patient room requiring  the contractor to work in this patient room only. The extension of ICRA barriers shall encompass any room sharing a portion of the shower wall.

3.	In reference to Statement of Work A.4, 2. It is stated that HEPA filtration shall be discharged directly to the outside of the building. Does each patient room have operable windows that will allow us to open the window and duct the filtration to the outside? If not please indicate the acceptable method of exhausting the air as specified. 

"	Rooms 632 and 631 are not equipped with operable windows. For these rooms the contractor may connect the HEPA air scrubber discharge directly to the exhaust grill in the patient bath room only. All other rooms are equipped with operable windows the contractor shall remove and completely seal with plywood, or other acceptable means to serve as a discharge point.

4.	Do all existing walls extend to the underside of the deck above? The reason for this clarification is we will need to know the extent of plastic barricades to install. 

"	The existing walls extend above the architectural ceiling, but not to the concrete deck of the floor above.



5.	The VA had previously stated that they are uncertain what is below the existing epoxy in the showers. With this said are we to base our pricing on removal of epoxy and minimal floor patch? It's nearly impossible for the contractor to include removal and patch of any unknown construction below the floor finishes. This floor could have ceramic tile below, mud bed, etc., please clarify extent of work anticipated.

"	The VA considers the floor under the current shower coating to be an unforeseen condition. In the event extensive repairs are required the VA will negotiate repair work beyond surfacing patching with the contractor awarded this contract. The VA shall retain the right to contract this work to an additional contractor, or perform the work utilizing facility staff if the contractors pricing is determined to be other than fair and reasonable.


6.	In reference to A.2 Mold Remediation. The solicitation is based upon unit pricing for removal of items if encountered, to include testing. Please specify the testing required by the contractor as well as where to include these cost. 

"	Testing is not required when mold is visible on the surface by EPA and OSHA guidance. In the event a surface is questionable to contain mold that is not visible the VA will provide testing at its own discretion and expense.

7.	In reference to A.2 Mold Remediation. The unit cost line items are fine and we will price as indicated, however we will need to include a minimum cost per occurrence somewhere. We could not mobilize someone with proper licensing to remove the mold if limited work is small quantities. Example, if our unit cost is $10 per sf and there is only 4 feet to be removed that would only be a total of $40. If there is no minimum per occurrence, our unit cost schedule would be very costly. 

"	The mold remediation is in relation to the potential to locate mold spores on surfaces that are not specified to be demolished as part of this project. The VAMC has specified the use of the EPA Voluntary guidance Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings.  As a basis for remediation methods. The VAMC would not consider this to be an additional mobilization issue as the hazards identified in the solicitation is inherent to the labor categories being sought. It shall be the contractors responsibility to ensure their employees are properly trained in the hazard identification, handling and PPE required by the task. Further information regarding PPE and training required is available at https://www.osha.gov/dts/shib/shib101003.html 

8.	In reference to Mold Remediation, will the VA be responsible for determining the presence and limits of mold once the wall / floor sections are opened up? 

"	The VA will assist and inspect every work site prior to closing of wall to ensure any surface mold is remediated according to the specified methods.
 
9.	In reference to the epoxy flooring, do you want waterproofing membrane installed? Both systems are available and offered. 

"	Section 2.2 item C of the project specification requires a waterproof membrane to be installed.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AMENDMENT 6 - Extension of Due Date for Receipt of Capability Statements<br /></span></strong>The purpose of this Amendment to solicitation MCC-13-RFQ-0084, is to extend the date for receipt of Capability Statements to December 31, 2018.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ****End of Amendment 0006****<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>AMENDMENT 5 - Updated Version of Amendment 5 Attachment Added<br />AMENDMENT 5 - Request Capability Statements:<br /></strong>Amendment 5 establishes a second cut-off date of <strong>November 25, 2013 at 2:00pm Eastern</strong>&nbsp;for vendors to provide Capability Statements with the intention of issuing&nbsp;Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).&nbsp; Capability statements should be sent via email to </span><a href="mailto:fullerdf@mcc.gov">fullerdf@mcc.gov</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.&nbsp; Amendment 5 expands Section B.2 Labor Categories/Rates to include labor categories under category entitled "Other" and add additional objectives under Section C.3.7 Objectives.&nbsp; Interested vendors shall submit a Capability Statement for the additional labor categories/objectives and/or the previously published labor categories/objectives.&nbsp; Interested vendors shall also submit the previously attached Workbook TABS entitled "Rates", "Past Performance Matrix", and "Business Information".<br /><br />AMENDMENT 4 - Responses to Questions is attached.<br /><br />AMENDMENT 3<br />The BPA covers six distinct technical work areas of possible technical work in the future: <br />&bull; Threshold Program<br />&bull; Economic Analysis<br />&bull; Monitoring and Evaluation<br />&bull; Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)<br />&bull; Social and Gender<br />&bull; Finance, Investment and Trade </span>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Each of these six work areas include a range of possible technical skills that will be required on future call orders, and for some, especially M&amp;E, the range of skills listed is very wide. Given this breadth of listed technical skills described under the BPA, it is possible that many (and possibly most) vendors will not have all the requisite skills across all six work areas or within some or all of the six work areas. This reality should not discourage vendors from responding individually, nor should it be seen as a signal that small vendors need to work together with a large prime contractor to be recognized by MCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">From MCC's perspective, the objective of the BPA is to generate a population of known vendors with known areas of expertise and interest. While vendors are free to work together to submit a response to the RFQ on all elements of the six work areas, that is not MCC's primary intent. Instead, MCC encourages vendors to respond individually or in small groups to demonstrate their core competencies on any or all of the six work areas and on any or all of the skills required within each work area. It is not MCC's intention to receive responses from a small number of mega-consortia that cover all areas; rather, MCC is seeking to establish relationships with a broad range of possible future partners. That relationship is expected to be flexible. Vendors that demonstrate core competency in a subset of skills within a work area or within a sub-set of work areas will have the opportunity to respond to future task orders either by building new institutional capacity in skills that were not previously listed or to work together with other vendors that have complementary skills. In other words, individual responses from small vendors that cover only a sub-set of skills or work areas will not preclude those vendors from bidding either individually or collectively on task orders that reach beyond the core competencies listed in their response to the BPA.</span></p>

IMPORTANT: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>IV. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. APPLICATION PACKAGE: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. WE ARE SOLICITING WHITE PAPERS ONLY. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal, see Section VI of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL/Rome Research Sites "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): A Guide for Industry," May 2012, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>2. CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION: Offerors are required to submit 3 copies of a 3 to 5 page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Estimated Cost, Name/Address of Company, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact (phone, fax and email)(this section is NOT included in the page count); Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, their Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, a fax number, an e-mail address, and reference BAA 12-14-RIKA with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph seven of this section.</p>
<p>3. SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 13 by 3 Dec 2012; FY 14 by 2 Dec 2013; FY 15 by 1 Dec 2014 and; FY 16 by 1 Dec 2015. White papers will be accepted until 2 pm Eastern time on 30 Sept 2016, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. This BAA will close at 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sep 2016.</p>
<p>4. FUNDING RESTRICTIONS: The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).</p>
<p>5. CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE FOR WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIB will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their white paper submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>6. All Proposers should review the NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM OPERATING MANUAL, (NISPOM), dated February 28, 2006 as it provides baseline standards for the protection of classified information and prescribes the requirements concerning Contractor Developed Information under paragraph 4-105.

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) The scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal with respect to the research and ability to satisfy an Air Force capability within the listed CTCs; (2) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques and (3) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. <br /><br />The Government may use the services of JAG Technologies to assist in the review of white papers, and provide advice on placement within the Information Directorate. The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government. Representatives of the foregoing firm who review the white papers and/or proposals will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals. If the offeror desires the cited firm be excluded from access to information contained in its white paper and/or proposal, offeror must so indicate in a letter of transmittal accompanying the document.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility and or network resources to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. If applicable, you must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your Proposal.</p>
<p>3. Data Rights: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>TPOC: Frank Hoke<br />Telephone: (315) 330-3470<br />Email: <a href="mailto:Franklin.Hoke@us.af.mil">Franklin.Hoke@us.af.mil</a></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (ACC-NJ) Maneuver Ammunition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, in support of U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC)-Automated Testing Systems Division (ATSD), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is currently seeking sources for the replacement/upgrade of digital test instruments for the Next Generation Automated Test System (NGATS).  <br>  This Sources Sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought. In preparation for a possible future procurement, ACC-NJ is performing this Sources Sought to explore a breakout strategy for this requirement. ARDEC-ATSD is interested in exploring the market capability to support this effort and determine if a competitive environment exists. The Statement of Objectives identified under this Sources Sought is as follows:  <br>  STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES:  <br>  The ARDEC-ATSD objectives are to replace/upgrade digital test instruments in the NGATS. The current stock of digital test instruments utilized by the NGATS have reached the end of their life cycle and have become obsolete. This effort shall be used to acquire, validate and deliver the next generation of digital instruments to be used in the NGATS.  <br>  Through analysis, the Government has determined that supporting and maintaining the current digital instrument has become cost prohibitive and it would make economical sense to upgrade/replace the cards at this time. Upgrading/replacing the cards will greatly reduce the cost of ownership as well as provide additional test capability.  <br>  DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW):  <br>  The Draft Statement of Work (SOW) will be made available through the Procuring Contracting Officer upon request. To obtain a copy of the SOW, interested sources shall submit a valid DD Form 2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, a fully executed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and an AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire. In addition, each company shall include the following information as a part of their request for SOW: company name, address, Cage Code, DUNS number, company size, business point of contact, and technical point of contact.   <br>  Interested parties shall submit a brief capability statement, no more than five (5) pages, demonstrating how they are capable of meeting this requirement.  Standard corporate brochures are not desired.  The capability statement should include the following:  company name, address, telephone number, email address, technical point of contract, DUNS number, Cage Code and company size (please specify as either a Large Business, Foreign-Owned Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concern, Woman-Owned Small Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone concern, Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Service-Disabled Small Business), and technical description of ability to meet the requirement.     <br>  In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all contractors wishing to do business with the Department of Defense must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). This registration can be accomplished at the following website: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. Therefore, all interested and potential firms must be registered in SAM, and current firms must update their registrations regularly to reflect the most current company information and to maintain active status ensuring registration does not expire. Whether applying for assistance with awards, contracts, or other business opportunities, all entities are considered registrants. Registration in SAM in no way guarantees that a contract or assistance award will be issued. The following information is required to register in SAM: DUNS Number; Tax Identification Number (TIN) and Taxpayers Name; statistical information about your business; and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Information.   <br>  This Sources Sought is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This is not a solicitation. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be published. If a RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this website for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. The Army is not seeking, and will not accept, unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government is not responsible and will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary. Please identify any proprietary information submitted. Any of the information stated above is subject to change. Information provided will not be returned. TELEPHONE INQUIRIES/SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The Government will accept questions via email ONLY. All submissions are requested to be made within seven (7) calendar days from the date of this publication, via electronic mail to the Point of Contact (POC) for this action: Ms. Vicki Bocchino, Contract Specialist, ACC-NJ-MA, email: victoria.r.bocchino.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>The US Army Communications Electronics Research & Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD) is interested in receiving information from companies that have experience in the design, development, and implementation of cellular Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology. The program will focus on adapting commercial cellular/wireless technology to provide soldiers at the tactical edge with extended secure wireless communications across the battlefield and enhanced Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. An example is providing secure, high-throughput data communication to dismounted soldiers across a complex multi-path environment. Metrics for success include; delivering high-throughput data access to the individual soldier, improving solider situational awareness, and increasing soldier mobility via highly mobile mesh topology.

<DESC>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain an A/B MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. <br />The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS. The Contractor shall perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of Medicare services, both institutional and professional, both in-patient (Part A) and out-patient (Part B) for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, as well as CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare FFS program. <br />The Medicare FFS program has complex legal, policy, and operating environments. The Contractor shall be familiar with, utilize and interact with all pertinent CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will coordinate its activities not only with CMS, but must also work with a broad range of Federal, State, and Local government agencies, CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders in the health care system of the United States.
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction, and will perform all standard or otherwise required editing with respect to these claims to determine whether they are complete and should be paid. An edit is the logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review. Contractors must be able to determine the need for locality-driven edits in their jurisdiction, as well as those included in the Standard and Supplemental systems, and to develop the logic for those local coverage determinations.</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also operates a provider customer service program and conducts a variety of Medicare provider and supplier outreach and response services, such as education regarding Medicare rules and regulations, billing procedures and answering telephone and written inquiries.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS REGARDING <br />DOS HITSS-II ACQUISITION:<br /></strong><br /><br /><br />1.&nbsp; Has the acquisition schedule been updated? In particular, when will the industry conference be held?</p>
<p><strong><em>The acquisition schedule is presently being updated and will be released in the near future. The industry awareness conference is in the planning stage and has not been scheduled yet. The conference will be held before the down-select process is conducted. We intend to conduct the down-select process for both acquisition tracks simultaneously.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />2.&nbsp; What is the down-selection process to be used for the HITSS-II acquisition?</p>
<p><strong><em>The down-selection process will be conducted using Advisory Multi-Step techniques per FAR 15.202. The objective of the down-select process is to eliminate any nonviable entities who do not qualify for award because they do not meet mandatory qualifications. This step reduces the number of proposals to be evaluated and discourages nonviable firms from spending their funds on high risk proposals, i.e., those having a low probability of award. The qualifications for the Advisory Multi-Step Process are:</em></strong></p>

<DESC>Solicitation is pending the execution of the Project Partnership Agreement (PPA). <br /><br />The response date for this synopsis is not the due date for proposals, the due date for proposals will be indicated in the forthcoming request for proposals. <br /><br />The Government will use a Best Value Price Performance Tradeoff (PPT) Evaluation Process in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15.101-1. This is a notice of the Government's intent to issue a full and open solicitation for the purpose of awarding the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP) Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Injection system with an estimated magnitude of construction between $25 Million and $100 Million. The Solicitation will be issued as Unrestricted under NAICS code 237990. There will be no options for this requirement. The Government contemplates that this solicitation will result in a single firm-fixed priced contract award. <br /><br />Description of Work: Construction of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Injection Systems as described below. The location of the work is in the Savannah River, Chatham and Effingham County, Georgia. There are two specific locations for the DO systems. The first location (Upriver Site) is on property adjacent to Plant McIntosh in Effingham County, Georgia, and the second (Downriver Site) is on property adjacent to International Paper (IP) on Hutchinson Island in Chatham County, Georgia. At the Hutchinson Island location, the DO will be injected into both the Savannah River and the Back River, both located in the State of Georgia. <br /><br />The construction of the DO Injection System at the project sites will include DO Injection System installation, on-site oxygen generation, use of Speece Cones, intake/discharge piping systems, pumps, electrical service, concrete pads, access roads, instrumentation, remote monitoring, security and perimeter fencing. All components of the systems must be constructed of materials durable in the marine environment and will not have detrimental effects on aquatic life. <br /><br />Potential long-lead time items in the project include the following equipment and/or material: <br /><br />Traveling Fish Handling Dual Flow Screens: The project includes the furnishing and installation of a number Fish Handling Dual Flow Screens, controls and associated accessories. The Traveling Screens clean and remove fish and debris from incoming raw river water. The Downriver Site will include four (4) traveling fish handling dual flow screens, each rated for 15,542 gpm, consisting of 40 mesh panels each with openings of 3/8 quote mark x 3/8 quote mark .

Downriver Site will include four (4) 12' diameter x 22' tall Speece Cones each rated for 5,500 lbs/day. Upriver Site will include eight (8) 12' diameter x 22' tall Speece Cones each rated for 5,500 lbs/day. <br /><br />Period of Performance: The period of performance for this project will be 820 calendar days and includes an interim completion period of 450 days for completion and Government acceptance of the Downriver Site. Completion of the Downriver Site is vital to the critical path for overall completion of the SHEP. <br /><br />Evaluation Criteria: The Government will use a Best Value Trade off evaluation process in rendering the best value decision for award of this contract. Only the offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government will be selected for contract award. The evaluation factors and their relative importance for this solicitation and evaluation process are as follows: <br /><br />Non-cost Factors: <br />FACTOR 1: PAST PERFORMANCE: This factor is more important than FACTOR 2, FACTOR 3 and FACTOR 4. <br /><br />FACTOR 2: CORPORATE RELEVANT SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> The Government has a requirement to provide software and hardware upgrades to the Navigation and Communication Lab (NCL) for the Maritime and Intermodal Training Department's Maritime Training Division located at building 839, Fort Eustis, VA. These crucial upgrades include bringing the Navigation and Communication Lab to a current state that reflects all recent changes in Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance(C4ISR) equipment being installed on Army Watercraft. This effort will also reflect all recent fleet <br> wide upgrades in Global, Maritime, Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) to Army Watercraft. The hardware portion of the upgrade includes replacing computers and monitors which will provide the needed platforms to perform the task of running the multiple complex programs of the NCL.To introduce additional companies to reproduce a new version of the existing NCL and CARNS would risk incompatibility with the existing training products that are designed to function and perform identical to what is currently installed on Army watercraft. Furthermore, the NCL and CARNS training is integrated with other C4ISR Maritime training simulation stations which would require update extensive updates if another source was selected.

<DESC>The FCC awarded the contract to Greenhill to assist the Commission with outreach to broadcast station owners to educate them about the Incentive Auction and the auction process, which will enable broadcasters to decide whether to participate and to understand their options should they choose to participate.  The Incentive Auction offers broadcast station owners unique financial opportunities to monetize the value of their spectrum usage rights.  To assess these opportunities, the contractor shall provide broadcasters with information needed to understand: the background and operation of the Incentive Auction, which is a complex and novel undertaking; the options available to broadcasters under the Incentive Auction, including channel sharing; and the valuation that could be attributed to the spectrum currently held by broadcasters if that spectrum is reallocated for mobile broadband use.&nbsp;

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to perform work as defined in this Scope of Work(SOW). Construction work consits of two temporary access routes across the dam face. Precise alignment shall be coordinated with the Contracting Officer's Representative. Access routes shall be temporary in nature, and allow access for government owned drilling equipment, including a tracked drill rig and four wheel drive support equipment. Temporary access routes shall be cut into the 3H:1V side slopes of the downstream face of Trinidad Dam. Materials excavated may be stockpiled either on the dam face or the staging areas provided. After use, the contractor shall replace materials disturbed and return the dam face to the original lines and grades. Replaced materials shall be compacted to the extent possible with excavation equipment used, but no compaction is specified. Access routes shall conform to the cross sections. Total length of access roads is approximately 2,800 feet. Access road layouts shall be approved by the government, but shall be on the 3H:1V sloped portion of the dam and shall not exceed the estimated length. The existing slope is covered with approximately 6-12 inches of sandstone slope protection. This material is degrading and a large portion is likely to be unusable. Care shall be taken to reuse the existing slope <br> protection to the extent possible. It shall be expected that up 500 tons of slope protection shall be required for import from outside sources. Imported slope protection maybe competent stone, rubblized concrete orerosion control mats specifically designed for use as slope protection. Slope protection shall be placed <br> approximately 6 inches thick.  Construction Timing: Timing of the temporary access road construction and replacement shall be coordinated with the <br> government to allow use by the government drilling crew. The government shall provide 30 day notice prior to the arrival of the government drilling crew on site, and access shall be available by their arrival. After completion of drilling activities, the contractor shall begin replacement of the temporary access roads <br> within 5 calendar days. It is expected that the drilling operation will last up to 45 calendar days. Instrumentation installed by the government shall be in the center of the access roads, in the locations indicated. Care shall be taken not to damage these instruments during replacement of cut materials.Soil samples shall be delivered to the contractor by the government. Samples delivered shall be handled <br> with care as undisturbed testing is desired. Testing shall be accomplished by the contractor as required herein. Soil samples will be tested for: grain size distribution including hydrometer (ASTM C 136 and ASTM D 422); moisture content (ASTM D 2216); Atterburg limits (ASTM D 4318); USCS Classification <br> (ASTM D 2487); direct shear (ASTM D 3080); and unconfined compressive strength (ASTM D 2166). Quantities are defined in the Bid schedule.The Drilling Contractor shall restore all disturbed areas to original conditions, as directed by the COR. <br> Restoration includes reseeding of areas cleared of vegetation. Restoration is not required on the dam face or on access roads already established herein.

<DESC>The purpose of this project is to improve main unit circuit breaker synchronization by moving the synchronizing signal from the 230kV side of the GSU transformers to the 13.8kV side of the GSU transformers at the Bonneville Second Powerhouse in Skamania County, Washington.  <br>  <br> The existing signal on the grid side of the main unit circuit breakers comes from bushing potential transformers on the 230kV side of the GSU transformers. In order to get the same signal to the 13.8kV breaker synchronizing equipment without the small error introduced by the transformation through the GSU transformers, new 13.8kV potential transformers are required on the 13.8kV side of the GSU transformers.  <br>  <br> This project covers all work required to furnish, install, commission, and place in service the new 13.8kV synchronizing potential transformers at the Bonneville Second Powerhouse. This includes but is not limited to furnishing and installing four new potential transformer cubicles rated 13.8kV, complete with potential transformers, new isolated-phase bus from the cubicles tapping into the existing runs of isolated-phase bus, control wiring from the new cubicles to the existing main unit generator control boards, rewiring inside the control boards, and verifying and updating the control board wiring diagrams. Work must be performed over limited outages in two consecutive years.

See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> USACE, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Contracting Office intends to issue a sole source award to STRAINSERT COMPANY, 12 Union Hill RD, West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2793 for the purchase of 400,000lb & 500,000 lb capacity compression spacer load cells to monitor the tensioning of the  <br> diagonals on the Greenup Locks Miter Gates. The CS-FB series manufactured by STRAINSERT COMPANY are  the only load cells that can meet requirement for the Greenup Locks Miter Gates. The high load to size ratio for the load cells are necessary because of the limited space available in the gate  <br> diagonal tensioning system where they must reside and also must be able to function for long periods under water. In order to maintain continuity, STRAINSERT's <br> load cells are required. <br>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION<br />ARTECH HOUSE ELECTRONIC BOOKS
<p>PURCHASE REQUEST NUMBER: F4FB BD421 0A001 CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: AFLCMC/PZIEB</p>
<p>I. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, FAR 13.106-l (b), AFFARS 5313.106-1 (b) this is a justification for other than full and open competition for a sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>AFRL/RQW C requires access to Artech House, one of the leading technical book publishers of communications engineering, RF/microwave design, computer security, nanotechnology, biomedical engineering, and GPS/GNSS research and information. Included titles from the Artech House electronic book (ebook) collection are highly respected and frequently cited within the aerospace engineering and scientific communities. The nearly 500 titles required are essential to aerospace research. These titles enhance the broad access to scientific research that is crucial to the work done at the Ai r Force Research Laboratory. The cost for access to the Wright-Patterson AFRL Research Library for perpetual access to the A rtech House e-book collection is based upon an official quote provided by the Artech House representative.</p>
<p>Artech House<br />685 Canton Street<br />Norwood, MA 02062<br />Phone: 781-769-9750<br />Fax: 781-769-6334<br />Email: jwstone@artechhouse.com</p>
<p>2. JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLICITING FROM A SINGLE SOURCE</p>
<p>The Artech House e-book collection is a unique resource for AFRL, not available from any other source, and supplements AFRL's collection of communications engineering, RF/microwave design, computer security, nanotechnology, biomedical engineering, and GPS/GNSS books for these subject areas.</p>
<p>Sole source acquisition is justified because Artech House has exclusive copyright to their data. They would not allow their data to be purchased from any other sources, nor do we have the option of going directly to other publishers.</p>
<p>Without this sole source acquisition, AFR L researchers will be forced to conduct time&shy; consuming literature searches in print volumes from the library's existing collection, risking the use of dated information. For those items not currently held in the library's<br />Collection, staff must attempt to borrow the vol umes from outside libraries. Having up-to-date real-time access to these electronic books will ensure research and development dollars are not spent on wasteful, duplicative efforts. The information contained in these books is one of a kind research critical to the overall AFRL mission.</p>
<p>AFRL would suffer considerable unnecessary financial detriment if this sole source acquisition was to be denied, with the library staff forced to purchase Artech House books on an on-demand basis. This would involve paying full market price for each book and the devotion of considerable staff time to the allocation of money to the library GPC and management approval of numerous GPC purchases. In addition, lack of full-text access to the 500 Artech House titles would resolve the often time-sensitive scientific research done by Air Force Research Laboratory scientists and engineers in support of the warfighter and the US Air Force mission.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since fiscal year 2013, AFLCMC/PZIEB/PZIEC has solicited for full and open competition on several occasions for requirements similar to this procurement, commonly referred to as "Subscriptions". Since FY13, for each and every requirement for which full and open competition has been solicited, it has been determined the original publisher of the subscription has offered a lower price than the other offerors which have been subscription agents. A subscription agent is a third party vendor that provides the subscription to the Government from the original publisher. If the subscription agent offers the same requirement to the Government as the original publisher, it has always been at a higher price than the original publisher because typically, the agents require a service fee, which is non value added to the Government.</p>
<p>Additionally, many competitive buys do not feature the original publisher as an offeror because these companies do not wish to submit a quote for solicitations which feature full and open competition. The primary reason for this is because the original publishers will get the business regardless of whether or not they directly submit a quote to the Government. If the original publisher does not submit a quote, the original publisher will still get the business from the agent who did submit the quote. Either way, the original publisher is satisfied, or therefore there is no incentive for the vendor to submit a quote to the Government because it is more work for them.</p>
<p>Research has shown that on average, since FYl3, the original publisher of a subscription provides the Government with prices that are $2,318 less than a subscription agent for the identical requirement, or 2.96% less, for subscription buys which are procured competitively. Therefore, for the reasons listed above, it has been determined that even if this procurement were to be competitive, it would not lead to a lower price for the Government compared to awarding the requirement sole source to the original publisher under FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Artech House is the only firm capable of providing the supplies described above without the U.S. Air Force experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be recouped through competition.</p>
<p>3. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION</p>
<p>Market research confirms that Artech House is the only known source for these 500 unique electronic book titles and is intended to supplement AFRL's collection of communications engineering, RF/microwave design, computer security, nanotechnology, biomedical engineering, and GPS/GNSS monograph titles.</p>
<p>AFRL Research Library staff surveyed the market for vendors to obtain competition in aeronautics and astronautics electronic book publishing. The library used publisher's advertisements and new publication reviews in conducting its surveys, and was unable to identify publishers providing aeronautics and astronautics e-books equivalent in scope and quality to the titles published by Artech House.</p>
<p>An intent to award on a sole source basis notice was posted on Federal Business Opportunity Net and no qualified responses were received that could meet the requirement.</p>
<p>The proposed sole source is the only la1own source able to satisfy thee Government's requirements.</p>
<p>4. STEPS TO PRECLUDE FUTURE SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS</p>
<p>AFRL D'Azzo Research library staff will keep an open dialog witl1the users/patrons and evaluate usage statistics to determine the necessity of these resources to supplement its collection of aeronautics and astronautics research materials. AFRL librarians will continue to survey the market for vendors to obtain competition for future requirements. The library also uses publishers' advertisements, interlibrary loan requests, customer suggestions and new publication review in conducting its surveys.</p>

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.

Siemens Clinical Analyzers are already in use at the John D. Dingell VAMC any change in clinical analyzers would require 6 to 8 months of testing, validation and training of Clinical Staff.  Keeping the current analyzers is the best option until the new consolidated VISN 11 Chemistry contract is completed, expected FY 2016.	

0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)
     	
     	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

0	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
     	
     	



0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
     	
     	

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	




(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
$960,000.  Until the VISN 11 consolidated contract is in place, this represent the Best Value, because replacing the clinical analyzers would require 6 to 8 months of testing, validation and training of Clinical Staff at a higher cost the would not be recovered through competition.  This price is fair and reasonable based on historical pricing for this service, The Task Order for FY14 service, VA251-14-F-0560, showed the same pricing, $960,000.00.  In addition, the pricing for the Siemens FSS Contract, V797D-30175 is already considered fair and reasonable.	
     	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
FSS and the internet were searched, there are 3 other Vendors who offer High Complexity Clinical Analyzers via GSA 66 III, SIN 605-4A, Beckman Coulter, Roche Diagnostics and Sysmex.  Siemens Analyzers were already in use when the last VISN Consolidated Chemistry Contract expired in 2009.	
     	


(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
VISN 11 is currently working towards a VISN consolidated contract for Chemistry Clinical Analyzers.	
     	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
Should another requisition of this nature reoccur, we would undertake a new market survey

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
 This is a request for Other than Full and Open competition Only one Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency, Requirements per FAR 6.302-1 for a Cost per reportable test contract for an HPLC Glycohemoglobin Analyzer contract for clinical chemistry under NAC Contract V797D-40130 by Schedule 66.  The analysis and operation is  performed by the Pathology and Laboratory Service Chemistry Section at the VA Caribbean Healthcare System, Medical Center in San Juan P.R. for a period of 5 years.  The VA Caribbean Healthcare System, Medical Center in San Juan P.R. and the Outpatient Satellite Clinics.  Contract Service is requested for October 1st 2014 through September 30, 2019.	

(3)	(A) DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
To procure all necessary reagents, papers, printers, columns, filters, calibrators and controls to perform the measurements of hemoglobin A1c in whole blood specimens for an existing Tosoh Bioscience G-8 Analyzer located at our VA Caribbean Healthcare System Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service at the Chemistry Section. The existing Automated Glyco hemoglobin Analyzer G8 is intended for in vitro diagnostic use for the measurement of hemoglobin A1cj.  The stable A1c offers a very accurate indication of the patient's long-term diabetic control over the last two or three months.  The High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) methodology is the gold standard for HbA1c measurement.  Tosoh Bioscience will provide:  Instrumentation, reagents, calibrators, controls, columns and the preventive maintenance service and warranty for the equipment during the term of the agreement.

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $267,720.00

The estimated period of performance will be for five (5) years after the notice to proceed which will cover a base period of twelve (12) months and four (4) additional option years of twelve (12) months each year.

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources. 

"	The G-8 Analyzer already in place is from Tosoh and all the reagents, columns, calibrators and controls to be use for analysis must be from Tosoh because the Joint Commission and the College of American Pathologist (CAP) would not accredited the Instrument if we use other companies' reagents.  The current/existing counter top for TOSOH equipment has the ability to place blood samples in multiple racks which Roche equipment does not facilitate.  With Tosoh's equipment we may place all the tests to be analyzed at the same time without any technologist intervention versus with Roche's instrument that we have the limitation of sample capacity.
"	A market research was performed and this evaluation demonstrated that the option that complies with the majority of our requirements at the VA Caribbean Healthcare System is Tosoh Bioscience G-8.  Also, instrumentation from another one (1) company were evaluated and compared.  Our daily volume is approximately 250 patient samples including all our Satellite Clinics (See market research supporting document).  Our breakdown on samples are approximately 4,941 test per month and the laboratory runs this samples from Monday through Friday from 0800 AM to 0400 PM.  (4,941/20 days= 247 test per day).  There are three (3) Chemistry Technicians for the night and weekend shift but neither are trained to use the Analyzer since they are to work on emergencies and other type of laboratory tasks by which the Analyzer is not used during their shift.  The bulk of samples arrive from 0230PM through 0400PM from our Satellite Clinics (Mayaguez, Ponce, Arecibo, Utuado and Guayama Outpatient Clinics).  Tosoh's Analyzer performs each test in approximately 1.6 per minute.  By adding the Glyco Test to the current chemistry analyzer (Roche Brand) this can cause a delay in the chemistry test processing and may create a bottleneck in the analyzer since the Roche loader capacity is 75 samples at the time versus Tosoh's loader that will hold 290 samples at a time.        
"	Tosoh's equipment can be continuously fed onto the sampler loader from primary tubes with cap piercing.  These piercing are made by the equipment during process.  Consequently, this will avoid any contact with the blood samples preventing any infection to be transmitted to our Medical Technologist by opening the opening the caps during the process.
"	The VA Caribbean Healthcare System daily patient test volume is 275 approximately including the Satellite clinics of Ponce, Mayaguez, Arecibo, Utuado and Guayama.    Therefore, productivity of samples by this equipment is more cost effective due to the fact that we have limited staff at this moment in our VACHS Chemistry Laboratory Section.  Providing overtime at this moment to our limited staff will not be cost effective and is considered to be a substantial duplication of effort and cost to the Government.

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
The anticipated price to the Government is $267,720.00 for five (5) years after the notice to proceed which will cover a base period of twelve (12) months and four (4) additional option years of twelve (12) months each year
and the price seems fair and reasonable in comparison with Purchase order 672A40006. This order represents the Best Value in the market because it greatly increases laboratory efficiency and productivity according to our specific needs.  Our Chemistry section handles a high workload and volume of approximately 60,000 A1c tests on a yearly basis.  One of the most important features of this instrument is the loader module which significantly improve our laboratory workflow because eliminates the variation that can occur with methodologies and it is the gold standard for this analysis in the market.  This is crucial because when physicians evaluate these results, any variation could be significant and could represent a change in the patient prognosis and treatment.

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
1) A market research was performed on GSA under NAC schedule 66 by the Chemistry Supervisor in January 2014 through the internet and CAP Today Chemistry Analyzers Report to acquire the information about the Automated Chemistry Analyzers available at this moment that fulfill our laboratory requirements and Accreditation Agencies (CAP and Joint Commission) regulations and this evaluation demonstrate that the option that complies with the majority of our requirements in the San Juan VA is the Tosoh G-8 Glyco hemoglobin Analyzer under NAC contract V797D-40130.
2) A Request for Information was announced through Federal Business Opportunity and GSA.   One interested vendor answered the Request for Information.
3) Tosoh G-8 sample Loader has the capacity for 290 patient samples in comparison with the ROCHE Diagnostics equipment holds  only 75 patient samples at the time.
4)The Instrument validation (Precision & Correlation studies and Linearity's) was performed for the Tosoh G-8.  
Other instrumentation will require these studies to be performed.            
5) The Bio-Rad patient report requires a LaserJet printer for individual reports which results in extra consumables expenses for toner and paper. In contrast, Tosoh reports are printed in thermal paper roll provided by the company.

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
Keeping the current equipment with this sample loader capacity of 290 tubes provides the Laboratory a truly walk-away system resulting in an effective and efficient workflow.  Our volume is 275 patient samples approximately.  These tubes (125-150) are all placed on the instrument and are analyzed without any technologist intervention until next day when it is verified in Vista.  With another instrument we have the limitation of sample capacity, therefore a technologist would have to stay longer to place all the samples incurring in extra expenses of overtime or compensatory time.  

 (8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
To foster competition for future acquisitions of the supplies or services being acquired would be necessary to have an instrument that can hold the same amount or more of the samples that can provide the Laboratory a truly walk-away system so it can results in a more effective an efficient workflow and in a much more cost effective for the Government by not incurring in any extra expenses of overtime or compensatory time. 

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons, United States Penitentiary (USP), Atwater, California, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with GE Healthcare. This announcement constitutes the only notice of intent. A written notice will not be issued. This is an annual service contract agreement for radiology equipment in the Health Services Department at USP Atwater.

The imaging system is manufactured by GE and must be serviced by a qualified GE service representative in order to comply with original purchasing agreement. GE is local and provides punctual service to the service site as to minimize down time for radiology equipment. Access to the system can also be done remotely, as needed. The service provided for the Radworks Archive also services the Diagnostic Radiology Equipment due to the two systems being codependent of one another. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written notification by mail or email to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be mailed to Celeste Walker, Contract Specialist, USP Atwater, 1 Federal Way, Atwater, CA 95301. Information can be emailed to c5walker@bop.gov.
