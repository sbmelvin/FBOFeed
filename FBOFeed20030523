<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for continued experimental testing of material electrical properties associated with spaccecraft charging. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services from Utah State University pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 for the acquisition of supplies determined to be reasonably available from only one responsible source.	Utah State University's Physics Department is the only organization that has the required versatile ultrahigh vacuum chamber and multi-material carousel to conduct experimental testing of the electrical properties of materials imperative to spacecraft charging within an acceptable timeframe.  This laboratory equipment was built to NASA Space Environments Effects Program (SEE) requirements and includes a tailor made rotating 12-sample carousel that enable multi-material exposures without having to break the seal on the vacuum chamber, thus shortening the test time.  No known organization has the capability to expose 12 materials to electrons, ions, and photons of less than or equal to 5 eV to 30 keV, and measure: Secondary and backscattered electron total yields; Energy-angle resolved scattering cross sections; UV-VIS-NIR photon electron yield spectra; Bulk and surface conductivity; and Arcing potentials.  Moreover, Utah State University's Physics Department is the only organization that can operate in the capacity to measure dielectric strength and the time evolution of electrical properties due to environmentally induced surface degradation and contamination without lengthy delays caused by material change out and vacuum restoration. Utah State University's Physics Department personnel possess primary expertise with conducting experiments testing the electronic properties of materials imperative to spacecraft charging.  Their knowledge in spacecraft charging is relevant and current to NASA standards.  Furthermore, they are uniquely positioned to begin immediate performance upon award. The development of this testing capability by another source would take a minimum of twelve months to complete.  This duplication would necessitate substantial expenditures of financial and schedule resources, which the requiring organization does not possess. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. See note 22.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 9, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<SUBJECT>A -- Intelligent Mixed Signal Microsystems Technology (IMMST)
<SOLNBR>BAA03-28
<RESPDATE>070803
<ARCHDATE>05232004

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals to develop and demonstrate revolutionary concepts in broad-band, high dynamic range adaptable Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converters capable to adjust in real-time to rapidly changing signal characteristics. 

Of high interest are those approaches that could take advantage of recent breakthroughs in device technologies, integration techniques, and design tools and methodologies that enable innovative component architectures leading to the realization of highly adaptable, highly integrated A/D converters or Intelligent Mixed-signal Microsystems (IMMSTs).

The proposed effort must include innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in mixed-signal A/D converters.  This new class of architecture must be realized as low power, highly integrated circuits, components, and/or microsystems.  Specifically excluded are those research activities that primarily result in evolutionary improvements to the existing state-of-practice of analog-to-digital conversion component technologies.  

The objective of this effort is to extend the effective dynamic range-bandwidth performance of multifunctional signal processing systems by exploring revolutionary concepts in analog-to-digital conversion techniques that will allow systems to optimize themselves in real-time to the particular properties of the signals of interest, thereby achieving orders of magnitude improvements and efficiency in the digitization process.  An example of an intelligent digitization process is one that can take advantage of the particular analog frequency/time information-characteristics of the signals by self-adapting the hardware resulting in the conversion process being more effective in terms of bandwidth, dynamic range, and power consumption.

Successful IMMSTs demonstrations will enable future systems to:  (a) digitize analog signals in a more efficient way by adapting the conversion process to the particular characteristics of the signals of interest, (b) self-calibrate for detrimental non-linearities (c) self-compensate for design and/or fabrication process flaws, and (d) trade-off in real time dynamic range for bandwidth in situations when the trade-off is justifiable to improve overall performance or to minimize the system power consumption.    For example, the ultimate goal is to demonstrate mixed-signal microsystems that will allow orders of magnitude improvements in the analog-to-digital conversion process by actively identifying the portion of the available bandwidth that contains the signal of interest, reduce the effective bandwidth, and digitize more efficiently the signal.   In addition, highly integrated and low power approaches are desirable.

This new class of Intelligent Microsystems (adaptable A/D converter) component must feature embedded design and test capabilities to allow adaptation (reconfigure on demand) of bandwidth and dynamic range performance to reflect the properties of the signal of interest, addressing the demanding needs of future multifunctional systems such as, autonomous sensors, and/or cognitive information systems.  

Of high interest are those approaches based on novel architectures capable of overcoming the limitations of current designs and fabrication technologies for high-performance A/D converters.  Innovation in component architectures with embedded self-adapting capabilities will enable systems to modify their transfer functions on-demand, allowing them to self-tune or self-adapt their center frequency, bandwidth, and therefore, dynamic range.

Potential bidders must select approaches that will lead to the realization of adaptable A/D converters capable of operating in dynamic (rapidly changing) environments.  Examples of the performance potential of these intelligent mixed-signal systems include: (a) the digitization of a weak signal in the presence of strong interference (i.e. jamming signal, high clutter or noise levels, etc.), (b) detection, tracking, and digitization of pseudo random hopping signals that are dynamically changing on a broad-band spectral region, and (c) detection, tracking, and digitization of dynamically changing chirp signals.  These scenarios are not inclusive.  Other scenarios in which the signals of interest are rapidly changing and the digitization process with conventional A/D converters is not possible and only revolutionary concepts in A/D architectures will enable the digitization process are of high interest.
 
Teaming is encouraged and the viability of teaming arrangements should be clearly explained in the full proposals.  Emphasis will be placed on integrated approaches, i.e., integrated teams formed to better address the many different technological and scientific aspects of the Intelligent Mixed-signal Microsystems Technology program.   Teaming between industries, universities, and/or federal and national laboratories with complementary areas of expertise is strongly encouraged.  While innovative proposals from individuals or small groups will also be considered, a website http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams/login.asp will be established to facilitate teaming between interested parties. Specific information content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibilities of the participants. Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination website or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility over the destination. This website is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.

This effort has three phases.  Phase I will be the architecture definition and critical building-block demonstration phase.  This phase will have a maximum duration of eighteen months.  Phase II will be the concept demonstration phase with a maximum duration of eighteen months.  This phase of the effort will start immediately after the successful completion of the Phase I activities.  Phase III will be the concept optimization phase.  This phase of the program should last no more than 24 months.  

Only those concepts that promise to demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-practice will be pursued during this phase of the program. The effort will culminate with the brass-board demonstrations of intelligent mixed-signal A/D converters with performance, and form factors suitable to address at least one military application.  

This announcement is soliciting proposals addressing the Phase I, II, and III activities.  Phase II and III activities should be proposed as optional tasks starting nineteen months after the beginning of the effort.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  (a) Innovative mixed-signal microsystem architectures concepts, (b) Adaptable mixed-signal building block strategies, (c) Active self-assessment and optimization strategies for mixed-signal components, and (d) Heterogeneous integration techniques and strategies for adaptable A/D converters.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-28 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency intends to award individual contracts to three vendors to obtain a product and support services to enable DISA to identify the off-the-shelf analyst workstation in the marketplace that best meets DISA's Department of Defense (DoD) Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT's) and Regional CERT's (RCERT's) operational needs.  The DoD Computer Emergency Response Team (DOD CERT) and the Regional CERTs (RCERTs) perform correlation and analysis of Information Assurance (IA) sensor data to support IA and computer network defense decision-making.  This enables the CERTs to execute their mission of recognizing intrusions into the Global Information Grid (GIG), and to plan responses, security policy changes, and Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) changes.  Currently, the CERTs rely heavily on humans-in-the-loop to perform this correlation and analysis. DISA plans to identify and test an automated IA sensor data aggregation, correlation, and analysis solution, or analyst workstation, capability that meets CERT requirements.  Based on the outcome of various lab and pilot tests, DISA plans to deploy this capability to the DOD CERT and the RCERTs to enable analysts to more efficiently and accurately analyze and respond to IA sensor data.  DISA invites vendors to:  (1) submit data showing how their product measures up to DISA's analyst workstation Measures of Merit (MOM); (2) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capability to be used in a pilot (an evaluation in operational environment) as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updates; (3) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capbility to be used in an operational environment as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updated.  The following documents are attached:  (1)  Solicitation DCA100-03-T-4013 includes proposal contents and certs and reps; (2) Statement of Work entitled, Analyst Workstation dated 9 December 2002; (3)  Evaluation Criteria; (4) DISA Analyst Workstation MOMs; (5)  DISA Sensor Grid MOMs.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology, plans to support a program of study which will investigate the feasibility of using laser cooled ions in Penning traps for quantum information processing.  The focus of the work will be the investigation of experiments capable of making "squeezed spin" states (i.e. entangled hyperfine states) of trapped ions.  The work will be mainly experimental, but will also include the evaluation of theoretical ideas for making squeezed spin states with trapped ions.  The experiments will concentrate on small plasmas of laser-cooled 9Be+ ions consisting of ~100 to ~30,000 ions.  The goal of this experimental work will be to understand the underlying physics in order to predict the ultimate limits and suitability of the Penning trap for quantum information processing.  Qualifications include high-level experience with Penning  traps, non-neutral plasmas, lasers, and experimental atomic physics.  Place of performance: Boulder, CO; Period of performance: twelve months. It is the Government's belief that the skills of the researchers engaged by the University of Colorado uniquely qualify them for this work.  It is the intent of the Government to award this procurement on a sole source basis under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1).This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures (NTE $100,00).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned. No award will be made on the basis of requests in response to this notice.

<DESC>The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) located at Stennis Space Center MS has a requirement for a mooring system design.  The objective is to develop a mooring design which will be used with the core fleet of NDBC buoys.  The purpose of the statement of work is to develop a design that is scalable for the full range of NDBC deployment sites.  The system will also need to be easily deployable from a wide variety of vessels including Coast Guard Buoy Tenders and non-Coast Guard vessels.  It will need to be sized for tethering 3-meter discus and 6-meter NOMAD buoys.  The buoys are moored in a wide variety of conditions from the equatorial Pacific to the Bearing Sea.  They see the full spectrum of weather conditions and can also be exposed to extreme currents.  They are deployed in many varied geographical regions and are exposed to a broad range of bottom conditions.  The mooring design must enable the buoys to survive the harshest environments as this is often when the most valuable data is collected.  The new mooring system shall be designed based on the technical requirements listed in the statement of work.  The designs shall be presented with model data demonstrating the full realm of ocean depth.  Model data shall include mooring loads at major connection points and position of different sections of the line under the specified environmental conditions.  Specific examples will need to be presented for a minimum of three operating depths.  All mooring components shall be selected and specified along with methods and designs for isolating dissimilar metal components.  In addition, schematics shall be provided demonstrating the static mooring design and the design as it is placed under dynamic conditions.  Any mooring modeling software shall be made available to NDBC for future design work to verify conditions on a station by station basis.  If the software is a commercial product, then the information shall be made available to NDBC for future procurement.  Prior to award, resume of principal investigator and key support personnel shall be delivered for review and evaluation.  Requests for the solicitation and statement of work must be made by email or fax.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  Email address:  dennis.morris@noaa.gov, Fax #228-688-3153.  See Note 1.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a limited competition for the Redesign of the Provider Statistical and Reimbursement (PS&R) system to the Fiscal Intermediaries (FIs) and subcontract Plans pursuant to Section 1816 of the Social Security Act.  The PS&R system has been maintained by CMS for over eighteen years.  Widespread changes to the system have been necessary because of expansion of the claims and regulatory changes related to the Prospective Payment Systems (PPS).  The cumulative effect of these changes has been to create an environment where system failure could result from minor changes.  As a result, there is a compelling need to redesign, develop, and implement a new system.  The system redesign contractor must possess the requisite subject matter expertise as the PS&R system has complex logic based upon a variety of business rules.  Specifically, in the three areas of claims processing, audit and reimbursement, and cost report settlement.  In order to obtain the required subject matter expertise, FIs and Plans may form teaming arrangements.  Teaming arrangements shall include the following required experience to successfully accomplish the system redesign:
 
1. Subject Matter Experts (SME) with at least five years of experience in:

a) terms of the migration of claims information into the cost report;
b) creating report-specific claims information from Part A claims data;
c) cross walking Part A claims data into cost report data;
d) terms of knowledge of Medicare claims reimbursement methodologies, particularly with regard to prospective payment but also involving cost reimbursement; and
e) tying back summarized claims information to detailed claims information and remittance advices.

2. Staff experienced with:

a) Outpatient and Home Health PPS as they pertain to PS&R;
b) Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility and Swing Bed PPS as they pertain to PS&R; and
c)   how all the Part A claim types are processed within the PS&R system. 

This notice of intent is NOT a request for a full and open competition.  CMS plans to proceed with a limited competition to ONLY the FIs and subcontract Plans.  Any questions with regards to this Notice of Intent should be directed to Ms. Sandy Bennett at (410) 786-5143 or to Mr. Thomas Snyder at (410) 786-0185.  All responses to this Notice of Intent shall be received in writing at the following address no later than Friday, June 6, 2003:  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Attn: Sandy Bennett, Mailstop C2-21-15, 7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21244.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency intends to award individual contracts to three vendors to obtain a product and support services to enable DISA to identify the off-the-shelf analyst workstation in the marketplace that best meets DISA's Department of Defense (DoD) Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT's) and Regional CERT's (RCERT's) operational needs.  The DoD Computer Emergency Response Team (DOD CERT) and the Regional CERTs (RCERTs) perform correlation and analysis of Information Assurance (IA) sensor data to support IA and computer network defense decision-making.  This enables the CERTs to execute their mission of recognizing intrusions into the Global Information Grid (GIG), and to plan responses, security policy changes, and Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) changes.  Currently, the CERTs rely heavily on humans-in-the-loop to perform this correlation and analysis. DISA plans to identify and test an automated IA sensor data aggregation, correlation, and analysis solution, or analyst workstation, capability that meets CERT requirements.  Based on the outcome of various lab and pilot tests, DISA plans to deploy this capability to the DOD CERT and the RCERTs to enable analysts to more efficiently and accurately analyze and respond to IA sensor data.  DISA invites vendors to:  (1) submit data showing how their product measures up to DISA's analyst workstation Measures of Merit (MOM); (2) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capability to be used in a pilot (an evaluation in operational environment) as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updates; (3) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capbility to be used in an operational environment as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updated.  The following documents are attached:  (1)  Solicitation DCA100-03-T-4013 includes proposal contents and certs and reps; (2) Statement of Work entitled, Analyst Workstation dated 9 December 2002; (3)  Evaluation Criteria; (4) DISA Analyst Workstation MOMs; (5)  DISA Sensor Grid MOMs.

<DESC>Closing date for revised proposals will remain 5 May 03.  The following questions and government response to those questions are hereby provided.

Question 1: Is it acceptable for vendors to just provide changes and clarifications to their original proposals as opposed to providing completely new proposals?  

Answer 1: All vendors have been provided an opportunity to update their proposal as a result of the changes posted in Amendment 4 of the RFP, and the discussion process.  As a result, all vendors should acknowledge their acceptance of Amendment 4 when either submitting a revised proposal or change pages to their original current proposal.  The Government requests that if possible, change pages vice a complete proposal be submitted.  In either case, as stated in the Feedback document emailed to vendors on 25 April 2003, the vendor must provide DISA with a change matrix that states which MOM scores, MOM addenda, and other aspects of their proposal have changed since their previous proposal submission.  Specific numbers of changed MOMs and their addenda must be provided.  Due to the time constraints incumbent upon the DISA evaluators, the evaluators will only evaluate those changed portions of the proposal that are mentioned in the change matrix.  


Question 2: Please clarify what components are included in the footprint space calculation.

Answer 2: As stated in the Footprint Scoring Scheme document, "The footprint scores are based on the amount of vertical space in a standard 19-inch rack that is consumed by the vendor’s proposed equipment that will be installed at one analysis facility during Phase 3.  In cases where the amount of space consumed by equipment at different analysis facilities differs, then the space consumed at the facility where the most space is consumed will be used as a basis for the footprint score.  The space consumed by the analysis consoles at the analysis facilities is not included in the footprint computations."  This means that the analysis consoles, i.e., the desktop computers and monitors with which the human analysts interact to view and respond to security events, are not included in the footprint computations.  All other components are included in the footprint computations.  

Question 3. The vendor also asks whether simply listing the hardware in their cost proposal is an adequate response to our request for footprint data.  

Answer 3.  It is not.  Section 3.3 of the vendor feedback document specifically states what they need to provide.  This is stated in Q&A format below.  

Question 4: What footprint data must vendors provide to DISA?

Answer 4: As stated in the Feedback document emailed to vendors on 25 April 2003, "The proposal must include a Phase 3 system architectural diagram that illustrates the types, numbers, and sizes of computer equipment that is proposed for installation at each of DISA's facilities.  In addition, the vendors must provide DISA the data necessary for DISA to compute the physical footprint score of your proposal using the new scoring system.  The footprint score will be based on the amount of vertical space (measured in U) in a standard 19-inch rack that is consumed by the vendor's proposed equipment that will be installed at one analysis facility during Phase 3.  In cases where the amount of space consumed by equipment at different analysis facilities differs, then the space consumed at the facility where the most space is consumed will be used as a basis for the footprint score.  The space consumed by the analysis consoles at the analysis facilities is not included in the footprint computations.  Vendors must provide DISA with specifics on rack space consumed at every location where equipment will be installed.  For example, a particular vendor might state that their solution requires 4U of rack space at each location.  This information must be consistent with the diagrams and product literature provided by vendor.   In the event that a vendor does not provide sufficient information in their proposal to determine their implementation's footprint score, then that vendor's footprint score shall be zero (the lowest score)."

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a negotiated procurement for Consolidated Facilities Management (CFM) services to operate and maintain the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library (Center) in Abilene, Kansas. Estimated Cost Range: $5,000,000 over a five (5) year period (Base Year of 12 months and four (4) Option Years of twelve (12) months each). The Contractor must provide all management, supervision, personnel, engineering, equipment and tools not furnished as GFP, materials, parts, supplies (i.e., light bulbs, filters, etc.), subcontracts, and transportation necessary to perform the Mechanical and Operational Maintenance, Janitorial/Custodial, Grounds Maintenance and Landscaping Services, including Snow and Ice Removal, at the Eisenhower Center in accordance with: (1) the manufacturer's recommendations and specifications; (2) industry standards and codes; (3) Federal, State, and local regulations; (4) GSA Preventive Maintenance Guides; (5) Federal environmental standards; and (6) OSHA regulations.  The Eisenhower Center is the traditional name given to the five-building complex which makes up the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library.  The Center is a part of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The Center consists of a 22- acre complex.  The Center receives on average 80,000 to 100,000 visitors each year.  Major events occur outdoors with attendance at times between 5,000 and 10,000.  The Center includes the Library, Museum, Family Home, Visitors Center, and the Place of Meditation that is also called the Chapel.  In addition to these five major structures, there is a service building with office space and a garage near the Library, a metal storage building near the service building, a fountain in front of the Chapel, a larger than life statue in the center of the grounds, five memorial Pylons at the east end of the Center, a kiosk housing a photo exhibit west of the Museum, and a working solar panel system east of the Museum.  Except for the Boyhood Home that is a wood frame house and the metal storage building, all of the buildings are constructed of native limestone. The Center and its grounds are open to and used by the public from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. seven days per week, 362(3) days a year.  Mechanical services are required 365(6) days a year, twenty-four hours a day, 7 days a week.  In the summer, some buildings are open from 8:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m.   In addition, the public also uses certain areas of the buildings for public programs in the evenings. Tourists and local people also walk on our extensive sidewalks throughout the day, evening, and early daylight hours.  The Eisenhower Center has a very high level of visibility to Government, non-Government and international organizations. It hosts former Presidents, Heads of State, and other important visitors on an individual and group basis, with many social functions conducted at the Library facilities. As a result, the highest quality mechanical services are essential to the day-to-day operation of the Library.  The Presidential Library facility represents a significant investment that must be properly operated and maintained to prevent deterioration of the buildings and the invaluable records stored therein.  For the protection of documents which are sensitive to chemicals and atmospheric conditions, there are restrictions on the introduction of chemicals, gases, oils, etc.  Technical Evaluation Criteria:  Management Approach, Technical Understanding, Past Performance and Price.  A Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract with incorporated Department of Labor Wage Determinations is anticipated. The requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are 561210, Facilities Support Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $6.0 Million. Copies of the RFP, which will be available on or about 2 May 2003, may be obtained through the Federal Business Opportunities web site at www.fedbizopps.gov.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of the solicitation and amendments, if any.  All contractors interested in receiving notification of updates/amendments to the solicitation posted on FedBizOpps are urged to enroll on the web site mailing list for this acquisition.  Those Contractors enrolled will be notified automatically of any changes made to the RFP through their e-mail addresses.  No telephone or fax RFP requests will be accepted.

SHAW AIR FORCE BASE 
SPECIFICATIONS FOR 
MECHANICAL HARDWOOD MIDSTORY REMOVAL


I. 	GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS

1.	Scope of Contract.  This work is being solicited to improve habitat for the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis, herein referred to as RCW), a species Federally listed as endangered.  This work consists of the mechanical removal of hardwood midstory vegetation on 211.8 acres at the Poinsett Electronic Combat Range, South Carolina, and will occur in sites presently occupied by RCWs (active clusters), sites presently unoccupied by RCWs (inactive clusters) and forested areas used by the RCW as foraging habitat.  Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment (including safety equipment), tools, transportation, supervision, and perform all work required to remove hardwood vegetation up to 6 inches in diameter at breast height using a heavy-duty brush cutter on selected sites in forested areas in accordance with the specifications and provisions of the contract. 

2.	Description and Location.  The area to be treated is within the boundaries of the Poinsett Electronic Combat Range, Sumter County, South Carolina.  The specific project area consists of four sites of mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest with a pine basal area of <40 ft2 per acre and a dominant midstory of turkey oak (Quercus laevis).

3.	Boundaries.  The boundaries of the sites to be treated will be marked with orange flagging tape as depicted on a site map, which will be provided.  Areas within boundaries to be excluded also will be marked with orange flagging tape.  

4.	Explosive Objects Encountered in Contact with Work Areas.

A.	Although the sites within the project area are not known to contain unexploded ammunition or explosive devices, any military items encountered shall not be disturbed in any manner and their presence shall immediately be brought to the attention of the Base Endangered Species Biologist.

B.	Any employee or other person working within Poinsett Electronic Combat Range shall have attended a pre-work conference with the Range Operations Officer and the Base Endangered Species Biologist.

5.	Coordination.  The contractor shall coordinate closely with the Base Endangered Species Biologist concerning items such as security, access to work sites, work schedules, etc.  The contractor shall notify the Endangered Species Biologist on Thursday prior to each weekend when work is to be performed.  This notification is required so that the Endangered Species Biologist can coordinate with Range Control to schedule the closure of work areas for the safety of the contractor.

6.	Work Hours.  Work is permitted between 1300 and 1900 hours on Fridays and between 0630 and 1900 hours on Saturdays and Sundays.  Work also may be permitted between 0630and 1900 hours during the period of 22 through 26 September 2003, but this time period is subject to change or cancellation depending on the mission needs of the military.  Work during other times may be possible with the approval of the Base Endangered Species Biologist.  Personnel must have vacated the property no later than 1900 daily and must notify the Base Endangered Species Biologist to ensure all gates are closed and locked after the property is vacated.

7.	Safety and Health.  Contractor shall comply with all applicable requirements in OSHA regulations.

8.    Environmental and Cultural Resources.

A.	Protection of RCW Clusters and RCW Cavity Trees.  The contractor shall use every precaution necessary to protect RCW clusters and RCW cavity trees within the project area.  RCW cluster boundaries are marked with yellow, diamond shaped signs with the following wording:  “Endangered Species Site, Red-cockaded Woodpecker.”  Equipment and supplies shall not be stored within RCW clusters, and work within RCW clusters must proceed with minimal delay.  RCW cavity trees are identified by two white bands painted on the bole approximately five feet above the ground.  Damage to these trees by vehicle, brush cutter or any other means shall not be tolerated.  The contractor shall be assessed $300.00 per skinned or damaged RCW cavity tree.

B.	Erosion Control.  All equipment shall be operated in a manner causing the least possible disturbance to the soil. 

C.	Protection of Streams, Lakes and Reservoirs.  Contractor shall use every precaution necessary to prevent pollution of streams, lakes and reservoirs by fuels, oils, other chemicals, silt or other harmful materials.  All streams will be kept free of contractor-generated debris.

D.	Protection of Archeological/Historical Resources.  The contractor, upon the discovery of suspected archaeological or historical materials, shall cease work in the vicinity of such material and immediately notify the contracting officer.

E.	Protection of Soil.  Contractor shall use every precaution necessary to prevent the contamination of soils by the spills of petroleum products (oils and fuels), ethylene glycol (coolant) and other chemicals and harmful materials.  Contractor shall also be responsible for reporting all spills of the aforementioned materials immediately to the Contracting Officer or his/her representative.
		
II.  TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

Use of Heavy-duty Brush-cutting Machinery.  The project area shall be treated with heavy-duty brush-cutting machinery that chips and spreads trees.  A minimum of two machines operating simultaneously shall be used.  Machines with low ground pressure (below 3 psi) are preferred to reduce soil disturbance.  Every effort shall be made by the contractor to avoid damaging RCW cavity trees, other mature pines, and pine regeneration.  Treated areas shall have hardwoods £6 inches in diameter at breast height knocked to the ground and run over until the remaining hardwood stumps and debris are &#8804;9 inches in height above the ground.  Treatments shall be made between 1 August and 26 October 2003.  All equipment shall be removed from the property prior to 31 October 2003.  

III.  INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE

Inspection Procedures.  Inspection by the Government of the work performed under this contract
		shall be made as the treatment progresses.  The Base Endangered Species Biologist will periodically observe the operation to ensure that all of the technical specifications are followed.

IV.  MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT

1.	Measurement.  The total size of the project area is 211.8 acres as determined using a Global Positioning System and is considered accurate.  A one-time payment will be made to the contractor upon acceptable completion of the project as outlined by the contract.  

2.	Basis for Payment.  Payment will be made at a rate up to but not to exceed unit bid price for the project as satisfactorily completed by the contractor.  Disbursement shall be made to the contractor following the completion of the work.

3.	Desired End Result.  Treated sites shall have all oaks £6 inches in diameter at breast height knocked to the ground and run over until the remaining hardwood stumps and debris are &#8804;9 inches in height above the ground, with the exception of those left to preserve pine regeneration, oaks that are not accessible to the machinery (due to close proximity to RCW cavity trees or risk of soil destruction), or marked with flagging to be excluded.  No RCW cavity trees will be damaged.  Damage to other mature pines will be minimal and areas of dense pine regeneration will remain standing. 

V.  SCHEDULE

All work shall be completed between 1 August and 26 October 2003.  All equipment shall be removed from the property prior to 31 October 2003.   Q&A from site visit:

1.	What type of machinery would be allowed to use?  A hydroax, escavator, gyrotrac, drum chopper, and bulldozer were mentioned.  Which will be allowed to accomplish this job?

Drum chopper and bulldozer are not acceptable.  Other mentioned equipment is OK provided the cutting head on the machinery can grind up and mulch vegetation.  Knocking down vegetation is not enough – it must be ground up/mulched to allow subsequent access to the area for other management activities (i.e., herbicide application with skidders, etc.).

2.	3 psi was mentioned as a preferred pressure for the machinery.  Is there a range that is acceptable, for instance 2-6 psi?

A range of 2-6 psi is acceptable.  What we are trying to avoid is the use of heavy equipment that will compact the soil, damage tree roots, and lead to mortality of pines.  So, the lower the equipment psi the better.  

3.	Where are the waterways located on the four sites, are there any ditches to cross, ponds, marshland, etc.?  The contractors were concerned with getting stuck and having to get across water.

All of the work sites are in upland pine habitat.  There are no ditches along the roads and there are no ponds within the designated work sites.  There are a few depressional wetlands scattered throughout the work sites, and we will mark these areas with flagging tape so the equipment operators can avoid them.  (We don’t want them working in wet areas because it can damage soil, sensitive vegetation, etc.).  

4.	How has the four sites been prepped in the past.  Have they been cleared, burned recently?

Here is past management information on the 4 sites, derived from the records in our office:
Site 1: 	1998 herbicide application (hack and squirt)
		1999 prescribed fire
Site 2:	1998 herbicide application (hack and squirt)
		1999 prescribed fire (south half)
		2001 prescribed fire (north half)
Site 3:	1999 prescribed fire
Site 4:	1998 herbicide application (hack and squirt)
		2000 prescribed fire

5.	Will there be someone readily available on-site with decision-making powers?

Yes, someone from the Natural and Cultural Resources staff will always be on site and readily available to consult with the equipment operators when they are working.
  
6.	What is the major dangerous wildlife that the crew should look out for?  I.E. snakes, spiders, etc.

Potential dangerous wildlife includes spiders, venomous snakes, and stinging insects such as bees, wasps, yellow jackets, and ground hornets.  If we know the location of a potential hazard (such as a bee hive) we will flag the area and alert the equipment operator.

7.	With security in mind, where will contractors be allowed to leave their equipment while they are not at work?

PECR is fenced and behind locked gates.  Equipment can be left near the PECR office when not in use.  It can also be left at the work sites when the range is down (typically from Friday afternoon through Sunday evening).  The range is also scheduled to be down from Friday, September 19th (starting in the afternoon) through Sunday, September 28th, 2003.
 
8.	Are there many large stumps on the sites from previous logging, how big are they in general, because many large stumps will tend to slow down and cause problems to the gyrotrac?
 
There are very few large stumps on the sites, so this should not be an issue.

9.	What is the likelihood of a contractor coming across an unexploded ordinance?

Prior to initiation of the work, the Natural and Cultural Resources staff and the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) staff will evaluate each work site to determine the degree of contamination and remove hazardous ordinance as appropriate.  Prior to initiation of the work, the equipment operators will be briefed by the EOD staff about potential hazards and the “do’s and don’ts” to follow while working on the range.  

10.	What type of insurance shall the contractor hold for this contract?

As prescribed in FAR 28.306, the CO determines insurance coverage is not required as of now.  

11.	How will the contractor be paid?

The contractor would normally be paid at the end of performance, but in this case the government shall authorize progress payments.  You may submit an invoice at the end of each 30 calendar day performance period.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST) requires a continuous wave, high power (>+8W), narrow linewidth, 532 NM wavelength laser.***The main application for this laser is pumping a frequency stabilized Ti:Sapphire laser.  Efficient pumping of the Ti:Sapphire laser requires that the pump laser beam has a TEM00 output mode with M2<1.1.  In order to achieve a narrow linewidth from the frequency stablilized  Ti:Sapphire laser, the 532 NM pump laser must have low noise.  The requirements for this are a power stability of better than 1% and overall noise of less than 0.05% measured with a 10 Hz-100 MHz bandwidth.  Evaluation factors include (1) price, (2) power, (3) technical merit specifically applicable to the intended application, including noise measured over a wider bandwidth than is specified above, and (4) applicability of the intended source to other possible applications requiring high power optical pumping at 532 NM.  Responses must be specifically address all performance criteria in this solicitation.  We request bids on both 8 W and 10 W lasers.  It is the government's intention to purchase ONLY one laser.***This acquisition is being conducted under FSR Part 13.1 (NTE $100K) as a BEST VALUE acquisition.  FAR provisions are available online at http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  This is a combined solicitation/announcement.  No separate bid package is available.

<SUBJECT>D -- Request for Information - HHS Consolidated E-Mail
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) for research and planning purposes to verify the feasibility of converting all of the HHS E-mail systems to a single centrally managed unified E-mail system.  The current HHS environment consists of 65,000 federal employees and 5,000 contractors.  The current E-mail system consists of 96,000 mailboxes averaging 50 MB in size distributed over 150 servers worldwide.  Approximately 50% of users are located in the Washington/Baltimore Metropolitan area.  WAN connectivity between locations varies from 256K frame relay to gigabit Ethernet.  90% of the installed base consists of Microsoft Exchange, mostly 5.5 but some 2000.  The other 10% are Novell Groupwise.  There is a mixed implementation of Windows NT domains and Windows 2000 with Active Directory.  Client access via thick client with browser based client for remote access.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather industry best practices for the design of a unified E-mail system that will lower the cost of messaging services to HHS and its sub organizations while improving functionality and features, provide a uniform and intuitive interface for E-mail and calendar functions across HHS, and  provide a standard E-mail address naming convention for all of HHS.  HHS is expecting to reduce costs by reducing the number of E-mail servers and the staff to manage them.  HHS is considering both in-sourced and out-sourced alternatives.  (NOTE: For the purposes of this RFI, in-sourcing shall be defined as vendor built and implemented and maintained by Government or contractor personnel in a HHS facility.  Out-sourcing shall be defined as vendor built, implemented and maintained in a vendor owned facility.  HHS shall provide oversight and management through SLAs.)  This information will not be used to award a contract.  In responding to this request, vendors should respond as completely as possible to the best of their ability and address the information below in their design.  If the requested information is outside of the vendors area of experience, please note that and provide answers to those areas that the vendor can respond to with confidence.  (1) Technical and financial considerations: (a) Number of servers, configuration (CPU quantity, memory, disk storage) and cost.  Include UPS, backup system, load balancing equipment, network equipment, fiber channel switches, cabling, and failover servers; (b) Operating system and version licensing cost, initial purchase and recurring; (c) E-mail system configuration – clustered using a SAN or NAS and cost; (d) Server licensing costs for E-mail software, initial purchase and recurring; (e) Solution must support secure messaging as it pertains to encryption/decryption and digital signature validation.  It must also support either a single or distributed repository for storing digital certificates; (f) Solution must support E-mail enabled applications using both MAPI and SMTP; (g) Users must have access to an intuitive calendar interface that allows them to schedule meetings across OPDIVS as well as view available meeting times for users across OPDIVS; (h) Solution must provide integrated wireless support (RIM Blackberry, Palm, PocketPC); (i) Solution must provide or be capable of providing via third-party software anti-virus scanning of inbound and outbound E-mail before it arrives in users mailbox; (j) Solution must provide or be capable of providing via third-party software anti-spamming functionality; (k) Solution must provide web access for E-mail and calendar; (l) Solution must provide for unlimited mailbox storage; and (m) Annual hardware cost assuming a 3 year refresh cycle for Intel and 5 years for Unix platform.  (2) The E-mail directory must be able to integrate with current HHS directory structure without requiring additional user logon.  Current HHS structure consists of multiple domains, both NT and Windows 2000.  There is no single forest root for HHS although Active Directory implementation is planned for the future.

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information (RFI): Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Software Communications Architecture (SCA) and/or non-secure (non-Type-I) non-tactical Software Defined Radios
<DESC>NA The Government seeks information from contractors familiar with the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Software Communications Architecture (SCA) and/or non-secure (i.e., non-Type-I) non-tactical Software Defined Radios (SDRs). The JTRS is a DoD overarchin g program to develop a family of multi-mode, multi-band, programmable radios based on a common architecture. Currently, JTRS acquisition plans only address secure tactical systems, while requirements exist for non-secure (i.e., non-Type-I), non-tactical ra dios and systems operating in base support and other similar functions. ContractorÃ¢Â€Â™s are requested to provide a strategy, potential schedule, and cost target for developing non-secure (i.e., non-Type-I) non-tactical Software Defined Radios (SDRs) whil e considering the following rough guidelines. Key issues to consider in the responses are the ability to develop SCA compliant SDRs (SDRs/SCA) which can be configured to load software independent of the radio manufacturer, certification of the SDR and asso ciated waveform applications in meeting SCA compliance, testing and NTIA/FCC certification of the final product. Strategies should account for subscriber radios, base stations, and repeaters. Guidelines: (1) Non-secure, non-tactical radios are commonly use d in base support operations throughout the continental United States by all DoD Services and contract support personnel.  All new acquisitions must conform to the narrow-band mandate, (2) Most base support operations only require a single channel radio in  either a handheld or mobile form factor; however, smaller quantities of two-channel radios would be required for mobile and base-station applications.  Base stations and possible repeaters cover landmasses from 10 square miles to 200 square miles, (3) SDR s will use either analog VHF/UHF FM (compliant with TIA/EIA 603-A) or the new digital voice/data APCO 25 waveform applications (compliant with TIA/EIA 102 series of P25 standards) operating between 100 MHz and 900 MHz.  There are requirements for a smaller  quantity of SDRs that operate from 30 MHz to 900 MHz.  These software waveform applications would be GFE/GFI from the JTRS JPO, (4) Certain base support operations personnel responding to national emergencies, terrorist incident, etc will require secure ( Type 3 Ã¢Â€Â“ DES/AES) SDRs; however, most will not, (5) The SCA does not mandate separate red and black side busses, software, and devices.  These mandates come from the SCA annexes and the JTRS operational requirements. The requirements of JTRS in implem enting the SCA force the designer to develop a large and elaborate core framework to allow dynamic mapping of resources, services, and waveform applications.  The SDR considered in this RFI would be best implemented in a static mode.  Consider how the SCA core framework could be tailored to this market, (6) Phasing of SDRs may be accomplished by meeting near-term requirements with demilitarized JTRS radios while long-term requirements should address manufacturing processes that meet only the requirements fo r base support operations, (7) Potential spin-off productions from a non-secure (i.e., non-Type-I), non-tactical SDRs/SCA can be transferred to federal, state and local first responders, emergency response units, law enforcement agencies, public services a gencies, etc.  The JTRS Program Purpose: The Government is procuring a family of affordable tactical radios to meet military communications requirements in a competitive environment by capitalizing on commercial technologies and processes.  The Software Co mmunications Architecture (SCA) makes it possible to procure radio applications such as waveforms and hardware independently. A major goal of the JTRS program is to use these waveforms across the family of JTRS radios regardless of manufacturer. The JTRS P rogram Background: JTRS hardware and software products will conform to a single Software Communications Architecture (SCA) currently under version 2.2.  The SCA  version 2.2 was released Nov 17, 2001. The core software provided by the JTR Set will provide standard services to manage the radio system and the radio unique applications will be implemented using the services of the Operating Environment.  The hardware  manufacturer will use government provided software waveform applications developed by other contractors.  The hardware manufacturer will be responsible for integration of the software. Subsequently, the government, the hardware manufacturer, or a third pa rty may install additional waveforms in the delivered hardware.  JTRS will be used in the military environment to provide command, control, and communications with their forces via voice, video, and data media forms during all phases of military operations  to include base support in non-military roles.  The JTRS program will field supportable systems for the planned operational environments that will meet readiness requirements at an affordable Life Cycle Cost (LCC). The RFI Intent: The intent of this RFI i s to gather information in order to assess the current state of technology, identify technology trends, and learn of industry intentions, the JTRS JPO will use this information as a data point to evaluate, revise, or adjust its strategy for acquiring radio  systems and application software. This RFI is not a request for proposals or solicitation of an offer. The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this announcement, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s use of submitted information. The requested information is for planning purposes, and does not consti tute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that any procurement will be issued. Information may be submitted either via mail or electronically (preferred), or both. Mailed information shall be sent to Mr. Craig Drew, Contracting Officer, JTRS JPO, 1777 N. Ke nt Street, Suite 2000, Arlington, VA, 22209-1901. Electronic information shall be sent to craig.drew@hqda.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13. The NAICS code is 514199 with a small business size standard of $5.0 million.

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional Japanese rare book cataloging services on a sole source basis from Costabile Associates.  The NLM has approximately 1,700 titles from Japan, consisting of printed books (60%), manuscripts (30%), periodicals (5%), and visual materials (5%) dating from the 15th to the early 20th century which have only minimal records in the library catalog, OCLC and RLIN, and occasionally lack records altogether.  The records, which exist usually, lack proper transcriptions and standard descriptive cataloging, including name authority work.  A majority of the material is in Classical Japanese (Edo-period), but much of it is also in Classical Chinese.  An historian of Japanese medicine has examined the books and made notes and written historical abstracts in Japanese and cited bibliographies for many of them.  

The purpose of this procurement is to obtain cataloging services for the library’s rare Japanese medical collection.   The project entails: 1) examining title pages, colophons, and other information of books, manuscripts and visual materials, as well as notes already prepared about the materials by an historical consultant; 2) searching titles in the OCLC, Kokusho sômokuroku (Tôkyô: Iwanami Shoten, 1989-1991), and other bibliographical sources; 3) creating or updating records for each item in OCLC using its CJK software and exporting bibliographic records into NLM’s local catalog and editing them there, all to the standards of Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (Chicago: ALA, 1998.) and Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Books (Washington, DC: LC, 1991); 4) creating or updating name authority records for authors, editors, illustrators, former owners or other added entries needed for the bibliographic records.

Costabile Associates is the only known source capable of providing the cataloging services noted above.  Costabile Associates employee, Ms. Sachie Kobayashi, has a Master’s Degree in Library Science and is fluent in spoken and written Japanese with an Associate’s Degree from Yamanashi Eiwa College in Japan.  Ms. Kobayashi has 8 years of experience in cataloging Japanese materials for Yamanashi Eiwa College, Kofu City Library, the University of Maryland and the Library of Congress.  Ms. Kobayashi has received specialized training in Japanese rare book cataloging at the Library of Congress using LC standards and the rules laid out in Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Books.  She also has a good knowledge of Classical Japanese and Chinese.  She has cataloged more than 250 items in the NLM collections and understands NLM’s cataloging rules and procedures.  She is also familiar with Endeavor’s Voyager software, used by NLM for it’s online catalog.  

Companies interested in provided cataloging services to NLM must perform 90% of the services onsite and be able to communicate with the Historical Consultant in written and spoken Japanese.  

This requirement is for a base year and the option of three one-year option period(s.)

RESPONSES ARE DUE BY 12:00 PM MAY 30, 2003 AND SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO:  NSANGOS@MAIL.NLM.NIH.GOV.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13. The NAICS code is 541519 with a small business size standard of $18.0 million.

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mulberry Technologies, Inc., 17 West Jefferson Street, Suite 207, Rockville, MD 20850.  

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has created the Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite, the Archiving and Interchange DTD, and the Journal Publishing DTD to support the transfer of journal article content and the electronic archiving of journal content for NLM through the PubMed Central (PMC) project.

Mulberry Technologies, Inc. (MTI) will support the implementation of the Archiving and Interchange DTD family within PMC, NLM, and the journal publishing community in general. Tasks will include collecting feedback on and maintaining the public DTDs; creating conversions, using XSLT stylesheets, from specified incoming DTDs; building tools for creation of print-ready files from XML using XSL-FO, and creating schema versions of these DTDs . A related task will be to support other DTDs generated from the Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite, including but not limited to a DTD for textbook material, a DTD for Online Documentation, and a DTD for journal article headers and abstracts.
The NLM has identified MTI as the only organization qualified to provide the requirements of this project.  MTI has extensive experience in the development and maintenance of SGML applications and specializes in SGML training and design.  MTI was involved in the development of the XML recommendation through the W3C XML SIG and is active with the technical committee of OASIS (formerly SGML Open) and in supporting the XSL effort.  Mulberry staff members have developed XML and SGML Document Type Definitions (DTDs) for application in industry, law, libraries, archives, medicine, chemistry, manufacturing, aerospace, commercial publishing, insurance, and electronics.  MTI has been working on XML projects with NCBI and NLM for 2 years. Members of Mulberry’s staff have been active in SGML since 1984 and in XML since 1996.
MTI has been involved in the creation and documentation of the Archiving and Interchange DTD family. The DTD Suite and the two DTDs have been documented by MTI using MTI’s proprietary XML Tag Library software.

In particular, it is MTI’s extensive experience with libraries, archives, medicine, and commercial publishing that makes it uniquely qualified to maintain, evaluate,  and document journal DTDs, create an XSL-FO conversion for print-ready output from XML tagged to the Journal Publishing DTD, and create expert XSLT stylesheets to convert documents tagged according to “source” DTDs to documents tagged according to NLM’s Archiving and Interchange DTD in the shortest possible time frame and at the least cost for NLM’s PMC project.    

The NLM has a requirement for the following labor categories and labor hours (up to hours reflects for the base year and all option years)

Senior Consultant:  Up to 589 hours
Consultant:  Up to 926 hours
Documentation Specialist:  Up to 559 hours

This requirement is for a base year and the option of four one-year option period(s.)

RESPONSES ARE DUE BY 12:00 PM MAY 30, 2003 AND SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO:  NSANGOS@MAIL.NLM.NIH.GOV.
