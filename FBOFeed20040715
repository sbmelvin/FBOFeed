<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service/GovWorks, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Lockheed Martin Missles and Fire Control, Goleta,CA.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  This procurement is to acquire one ImageIR LWIR Thermal Imaging and Measurement System and accessories.  The total estimated cost of the procurement is $148,300.00.  The Objective Mobile Infrared Scene Projector lab of RTTC utilizes radiometric cameras in support of missile systems.  Currently, an existing SBFP Mid Wave Infrared camera is used for Mid Wave applications.  The Mid Wave IR software can be modified to accommodate the SBFP Long Wave Camera which is cost effective in both time and engineering effort.  Additionally, technicians are familiar with the operation and maintenance of the Mid Wave camera and this will transfer to the Long Wave camera, limiting the learning curve on operation and maintenance.  To compete this action and award to another vendor would result in loss of compatibility between hardware and existing software, and the need to train additional personnel in the operation and maintenance of another vendor's product.  Award to another vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost that the Government is not expected to be recovered through an open competition.  RTTC has determined that the equipment required  is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. Award to a vendor other than Lockheed Martin Missles and Fire Control Technologies would result in the acquisition of substandard equipment that will not meet mission requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST July 26, 2004, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  POC:  Mathew Ridolfi, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be emailed  to Mathew Ridolfi at  Mathew.ridolfi@mms.gov.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<DESC>“Improved Health of Bolivians – Strengthening Clinical Services and Health Systems Management” RFP Pre-Solicitation.

This is a pre-solicitation announcement.  This is NOT an invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract or cooperative agreement.  However, potential sources that may be interested in this competitive process are requested to mail, fax, or e-mail their interest to the contact address by July 30, 2004.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement a program described below.  Under a new Strategic Objective Agreement (SOAG) being negotiated between USAID/Bolivia and the Government of Bolivia, USAID will support a triad of activities to strengthen capacity within the decentralized public sector health care system.  Through PROSIN II, a project implementation unit within the Ministry of Health, USAID will support policy development, health systems oversight, service coordination, and strategic leadership within the central and departmental levels of the public health sector.  

To improve clinic-based health service delivery and management capacity at the local level (health networks and municipalities), USAID will solicit a Contractor to provide technical assistance, training, and logistical support.  The Contractor’s activities will focus on four priority components: (1) Management Capacity-Building to strengthen  the capacity of local health networks to manage decentralized health services in accordance with national policies and standards, and to promote management capacity at central and departmental health levels and among USAID-funded non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as requested; (2) Quality and Coverage of Clinical Health Services to ensure that local health networks have the tools and competencies to assure the delivery of a basic package of quality services for improved child health and nutrition, prevention and control of infectious diseases, and reproductive health, and to provide similar specialized technical assistance to other USAID-funded implementing partners as needed; (3) Municipal Matching Funds to be designed and managed in support of Local Health Plans and improved quality of health services; and (4) Additional Support Services to provide procurement planning and services, as well as logistical support, for selected USAID-funded implementing partners and activities.  To successfully implement these activities, the Contractor must have significant capacity in providing technical assistance in management of health care systems as well as expertise in improving the quality of clinical health care services.

Important cross-cutting themes which must be integrated into the design and implementation of the Contractor’s activities include: responsiveness to the unique multicultural context of Bolivia, redressing gender inequities in health, and institutionalizing local capacity-building skills.  The Contractor will be expected to model such desired outcomes in its organizational structure, cultural and gender diversity of the staffing plan, and implementation of specific and measurable strategies to promote local technical assistance capacity.

Through another mechanism, USAID/Bolivia will also support improved community-based health services.  Including PROSIN II, this triad of partners under the SOAG will coordinate their activities in selected municipalities to achieve the desired results of (1) increased ability of individuals, families, and communities to take action to improve health, (2) expanded delivery if quality, high-impact services through health networks, and (3) strengthened institutional capacity for health care management and sustainability.   

It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF), completion type contract will be awarded for implementation of the four priority components specified above.  Implementation will occur over a 5 year period.  USAID/Bolivia encourages qualified Offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  The Mission anticipates issuing the RFP o/a August 10, 2004.  Proposal due date will be October 11, 2004.

<DESC>The Sea Duck Joint Venture (SDJV) is a partnership-based conservation program under the North American Waterfowl Management Plan that promotes the conservation of sea ducks by providing greater knowledge for effective management.  The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a partner in the SDJV, administers grants, purchase orders, and contracts on a competitive basis for projects/studies that advance both our and the general scientific community's understanding of sea duck biology and ecology and is seeking proposals from interested parties.  To be competitive for funding, proposals should provide at least a 1:1 match for SDJV funds.  Currently the only source of general funding is U.S. Congress-appropriated funds directed to USFWS for SDJV use -- we are expected to demonstrate effective leveraging of these funds, preferably with non-U.S.-federal resources. Awards will be issued via purchase orders, cooperative agreements, intra- or inter-agency agreements based on a Service analysis of the nature of each selected project in light of the Federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements Act of 1977 (31 USC 6301-6308) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 17.5. Federal assistance awards (grants and cooperative agreements) will be administered under the direction of 43CFR12.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO PROCURE A BUNDLED CONTRACT: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will issue a request for proposal (RFP) for the following item:  Prazosin HCl 1MG Cap, package size 100’s and 1000’s; 2MG Cap, package size 100’s and 1000’s and 5MG Cap, package size 100’s and 250 OR 500’s.  NOTE: Where there is a choice of package size as indicated by the word “OR”, the offeror must submit a price on at least one of the two sizes indicated.  Award will be made on the package size most advantageous to the Government.  The estimated annual usage is 47,044 bottles.  The estimated annual usage does not include DoD, IHS and BoP’s requirements at this time.  Award will result in a National Contract, for mandatory use of Prazosin.  This will be a negotiated solicitation resulting in a contract for 1 year plus (4) one year options. If the offeror is not the manufacturer, a copy of the signed agreement between the vendor and the manufacturer must be submitted with the proposals. The agreement must be for the maximum term of the contract. If this agreement is not provided, the vendor will be considered non-compliant and removed from consideration. Price is the most important factor.   Items will be awarded as an aggregate. Vendor must state the exact name (name that appears on label) by which the drug will be supplied and have a unique NDC number. All products must have at a minimum the NDC number bar coded on each individual unit. Bar Code Validation is the process of insuring the data on a bar code label received from suppliers and vendors meet minimum requirements for font, readability, data integrity, and completeness. All bar codes received from the company must verify at a grade of C or higher Suppliers must provide bar coded product that meets these minimum requirements. Methods should be in place to report bar codes that fail validation requirements. Vendors are required to replace products that do not meet minimum validation requirements. The bar code must be in a linear format and conform to all UCC/EAN standards. This means the bar code can be any linear bar code symbiology, such as UCC/EAN-128, RSS, or UPC (if the UPC contains the NDC).  Since the bar code would be a part of the drugs label issues concerning its quality and verification would be subject to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP's) Additionally, vendors should be encouraged to provide the expiration date and lot number in the bar code. The contractor must ensure delivery of the product to the Prime Vendors no later than 45 days after award. The requirements listed above are for VA, DoD, IHS and BoP.  The contracted product will be automatically substituted at the PPV; all other products will be locked out for VA only. Glass bottles are not acceptable. Tablets/capsules must be compatible with automated dispensing units (Baxter ATC Canisters, OptiFill etc.)  The Government reserves the right to add other package sizes to the contract at a later date when they become available or if offered in a vendor’s proposal. This will not affect the number of tablets/capsules listed in the usage requirements. All bottles of 100 tablets or less must have a child resistant closure.   OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  A formal solicitation or request for quotations will be issued at a later date.  NOTE:  PRODUCT MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, CARRIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR NAFTA COUNTRY, (UNITED STATES, CANADA AND MEXICO).  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND IN THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 25.003.  COMMENTS MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN AUGUST 5, 2004.  For additional information regarding contracting issues please contact Sarah Sobor-Bristow, Senior Contracting Officer at Sarah.Bristow@med.va.gov or (708) 786-4934.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to negotiate a cost-reimbursement contract with Schulman, Ronca & Bucuvalas, Inc (SRBI) for the services to prepare existing Motor Vehicle Occupant Safety Survey (MVOSS) databases for use by the public through NHTSA's Web site, and to provide NHTSA in report-form a summary of the findings over time from NHTSA Buckle Up America telephone surveys.  

The Motor Vehicle Occupant Safety Survey (MVOSS) is a national telephone survey conducted for NHTSA approximately every two years.  The survey began in Fall 1994.  Subsequent administrations of the survey occurred at the end of calendar years 1996, 1998, and 2000.  The most recent MVOSS was in the field the first quarter of calendar year 2003.

The MVOSS is primarily a detailed survey of attitudes, knowledge, and self-reported behavior in areas of occupant protection.  It is composed of two questionnaires, one of which focuses on safety belts and the other on child restraint use.  However, the MVOSS also contains modules on air bags, speeding, alcohol use, EMS, and crash injury experience.  Modules initially found on the MVOSS, but since discontinued, include pedestrian safety and motorcyclist issues.

The two MVOSS questionnaires are administered to independent probability samples of randomly selected persons age 16 and older, with over-sampling of persons ages 16 through 39.  The sample size was approximately 4,000 respondents per questionnaire for the 1994, 1996, and 1998 surveys.  After 1998, the sample size was increased to approximately 6,000 respondents per questionnaire.

The large sample size, large number of questions, and complexity of questionnaire design make the MVOSS the most comprehensive source of telephone survey data in the occupant protection field.  Wide-ranging summary reports have been published following each administration of the survey.  However, to date, direct public access to the data is severely limited.  Increasingly, requests are being received by NHTSA for access.  While some data files for the 2000 MVOSS have been sent to parties requesting the data, this has been an inefficient manner of making the data available.  

There is a need for NHTSA to provide an efficient mechanism by which researchers, safety professionals, and other interested members of the public can access MVOSS data.  This would not only provide a service to the public but would also benefit NHTSA as far greater analyses of data would occur, and far more results having implications for design of traffic safety programs would be published.


Besides the MVOSS, NHTSA has been conducting national telephone surveys to assess penetration of enforcement messages during national safety belt mobilizations.  The mobilizations began during 1998 under the Buckle Up America Campaign and have been conducted twice a year since then (in May and November).  NHTSA-sponsored national telephone surveys have been conducted prior to, and immediately following, almost all of the mobilizations.  Each pre- and post mobilization survey wave was administered to a  national probability sample of approximately 1200 randomly selected persons age 16 and older (independent Regional and State samples were also interviewed during some of the mobilizations).  The survey included questions asking about belt use, perceptions of enforcement, and awareness of media messages.

The BUA surveys were largely established to assist the agency in its strategic decision-making for future Buckle Up America activity.  Therefore, summary reports of the findings, although submitted to NHTSA by the Contractor after each mobilization, were not published.  In recent years, data from the mobilization surveys have been included in published reports summarizing the results of Click It or Ticket Campaigns.  Yet there remains no comprehensive documentation of the results of the BUA surveys that is available for view by the public.  Both NHTSA and the public would benefit by issuance of a report that presents an historical accounting of how well the national BUA and Click It or Ticket campaigns penetrated public awareness and affected perceptions of enforcement.

The objectives of this procurement are to:  (1) Prepare all the existing MVOSS databases  (1994 through 2003) for use by the public.  This shall include developing support documentation and constructing banners for results of high interest.  The Contractor also shall work with NHTSA in developing the public access mechanism on NHTSA’s Web page.  This includes making all data and information files compatible for use through the public access mechanism, and testing the system once NHTSA has set it up. (2) Prepare a report that provides the results from all the national BUA survey waves conducted since 1998, as well as selected Regional surveys corresponding with Regional Click It or Ticket campaigns.  The report shall include information pertaining to the level of program activity during each mobilization.  

Interested firms should identify their capability to provide the necessary services as described above. The written response must include detailed information relating to the specific services being requested. Expressions of interest without sufficient detail to permit evaluation of one’s ability to provide the necessary services will not be considered. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations nor is a Request-for-Quotations solicitation document currently available. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. In the absence of responses from interested firms demonstrating their capability, NHTSA intends to request a quotation from Schulman, Ronca & Bucuvalas, Inc. on a noncompetitive basis for the work described. Responses must be received by the listed procuring office within 15 days from the date of publication of this notice.   





A period of performance of 12 months is contemplated for this procurement.  Electronic copies of the RFP and any other documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to acquire on an other than full and open competitive basis, training, exercise and rehearsal mission support services in support of the U.S. Joint Forces Command Joint Warfighting Center (JWFC), Suffolk, VA.  The requirement is for twelve months of services, anticipated to commence 15 October 2004, with one (1) twelve-month option period.  The mission of JWFC is to provide for both service and joint training, which includes the full spectrum of support in the conduct of events including planning, scheduling, logistics, simulation, intelligence, scenario development, database builds, distributed learning, courseware development, technical and facility support, as well as all the other elements associated with JWFC’s Joint Training Program (JTP).  The requirement of this acquisition focuses on the requests made by Combatant Commands and Service Level components for the augmentation of the JTP training scenarios and training packages beyond the funded JTP.  Northrop Grumman was competitively awarded contract N00140-01-C-1195 for the training support to the JWFC.  The training augmentations are built upon the already developed JTP training scenarios.  The instant acquisition is being processed on the basis of Other than Full and Open Competition, sole source to Northrop Grumman under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Northrop Grumman is considered the only responsible source capable of providing the required support of the JWFC, as this firm has the requisite knowledge to take the packages developed under the JTP and modify to satisfy Combatant Commander specific training requirements.  Furthermore, the contractor must have an integral knowledge of what is going on in mission requirements under the current JWFC support contract because the increased mission requirements are virtually identical where the contractor must have the ability to carry over lessons learned and past history from training events supported under contract N00140-01-C-1195.  All other responsible sources may submit documentation for consideration regarding their ability to provide the required services, as well as financial and technical information.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Such information, if submitted, should be forwarded to FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Avenue, Building 2B, Philadelphia, PA 1911-5083, to the attention of John D. Favata, Code 02P22Z, and reference Solicitation N00140-05-R-H001.  The placement of an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity type contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee provisions is contemplated.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard are 611430 and $6M, respectively.  A letter requesting a copy of the solicitation should be mailed to the above address or telefaxed to 215-697-9569, Attn: John D. Favata.  Upon release, the solicitation will be available at the Navy Electronic Commerce Office (NECO) web address: http://www.neco.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), intends on issuing an award under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Advanced Systems Technologies, Inc. (AST), on 6000 Technology Drive, Building 8, Huntsville, Alabama for engineering design support and demonstration of convergent spray technology for nonskid coating system applications. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). Advanced Systems Technologies, Inc. (AST) will demonstrate material application and coverage rates with CST equipment on one or more panels covering up to 80ft2, for a single primer/nonskid system.  The Contractor will be required to assemble a unit and perform preli minary evaluations of the prototype shipboard CST application device.  The purpose of this requirement is to assist NSWCCD in evaluating the performance of CSTä for application of nonskid and validating that the system meets shipboard design requirements. These are necessary steps that, if successful, will lead to NAVSEA in-service tests, and ultimately to approval of CSTä for applying nonskid coatings to ships.  The shipboard demonstration will be contingent upon the success of the coating system during panel testing. The proposed procurement is for services of a highly technical or specialized nature. AST maintains the following patent rights: 5,565,241 Convergent End Effector;  5,579,998 Method For Coating a Substrate With A Reinforced Resin Matrix; 5,307,992 Method and System for Coating a Substrate With A Reinforced Resin Matrix. The hardware covered under these patents fo rm the foundation of convergent spray technology and is essential to complete the overall program objectives.  Additionally, NSWCCD has been working with AST for the past two years on previous contracts. This work, knowledge, and experience gained by AST would create substantial duplication costs if another vendor was selected for this work and would not be recovered through competition. This is NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS however all interested and responsible parties may submit their technical capabilities to the above POC via email harrisonhl@nswccd.navy.mil within 15 days after the publication of this notice. The capability statement and any other information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NSWCCD to determine if the party can fully meet the requirement described above. Information received will normally be considered solely for t he purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. (See note #22)

The following factors are to be used to evaluate offerors: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY –Each offer will be evaluated based on how well the proposed product(s) meet the Government’s requirements in relation to the statement of work.  Some areas to be considered are: Documented ability to provide the required equipment, service plans, and technical requirements.  Documented ability to meet the Government’s minimum regional coverage requirements to include providing a frequency that provides adequate service from North to Northern  Maryland, South to Richmond, Virginia, and West to Fredericksburg.  The service provider will also be evaluated on the documented regional coverage for the Seal Beach, California area as well.  Nationwide coverage will also be assessed.  Documented viability of the Phase-In Plan, which addresses relevant issues such as reprogramming and timing such to present minimal impact to the end users.  Documented Standard Warranty on purchased equipment of at least one year and for the lifetime of the equipment that is leased. Documented ability to meet the Government’s unique invoicing requirements.  Documented ability to meet the Government’s administrative requirements to include items such as Termination without penalty in Emergency situations, single point of contact for customer service, a four-hour response time, replacement at no additional costs to include shipping, and other f actors as listed in the statement of work.

Documented ability to meet the Government’s requirement of delivery within five working days after issuance of order for orders placed with known quantities.  Documented ability to meet the Government’s requirement of delivery within seven working days after notification for orders placed with Not-to-Exceed Amounts.

PAST PERFORMANCE- this assessment will address an offer’s past performance working on contracts of a similar size for similar support and of a similar complexity.  Timeliness of delivery and customer service will also be assessed within  Past Performance.  PRICE - Price is not scored and is not considered the most important factor.  However, the importance of price as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the remaining evaluation factors.  Further, after evaluation of the technical and price proposals, cost may be the deciding factor for selection, depending on whether a highly evaluated technical proposal warrants the evaluated price difference.

<DESC>The NHLBI plans to release a Request for Proposals for a Clinical and Data Coordinating Center to establish a registry to collect and analyze clinical data and blood and tissue samples of patients with Marfan Syndrome (and other connective tissue disorders associated with aortic disease) in order to improve understanding of cardiovascular complications and therapies for aortic aneurysmal disease and its complications.  Ultimately the registry will provide an essential resource to improve clinical care for patients afflicted with cardiovascular complications of Marfan Syndrome and other genetically-triggered aortic aneurysmal disease. The NHLBI would like information from academic institutions, professional groups and private industries regarding screening, surveillance and treatment of cardiac complications of Marfan Syndrome and other connective tissue disorders associated with aortic aneurysms and or valvular disease in order to identify optimum parameters to establishing a registry and ways to design and implement an effective program.  Specifically, NHLBI seeks advice concerning core information to be collected, concerns and solutions to protect rights of patients, facilities, providers and support teams.  Also important are independence of data analysis, access to data and data sharing, and potential strategies for the registry to become at least partially self-supporting.  Ways to involve private industry without undermining the independence of the program governance are also sought.  Finally, while NHLBI is primarily interested in cardiovascular issues, expansion of the data collected in order to include extra-cardiac manifestations of the connective tissue disorders such as joint disease, craniofacial disorders or others may be possible if there interest and support from other Institutes, and/or private or professional groups.  In 2002, the NHLBI and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) met with members of the National Marfan Foundation (NMF) at their request.  In follow-up, NHLBI convened a Marfan Working Group in June of 2002.  The registry is considered a critically important initial step to stimulate investigator-initiated research in Marfan Syndrome.  Marfan Syndrome is an autosomal-dominant, inherited connective tissue disorder that is associated with cardiovascular complications, including mitral valve prolapse, aortic aneurysmal and valvular disease, and heart failure.  Premature death for Marfan patients is the result of aortic disease resulting in progressive dilatation of the ascending aorta leading to aortic valve insufficiency, heart failure, and/or aortic rupture. Cardiac surgery to treat thoracic aortic disease has improved survival.  Nevertheless, Marfan patients with progressive aortic disease have a shortened life span.  Treatment for Marfan Syndrome, including cardiac surgery is hampered by the small numbers of patients seen, even at tertiary referral medical centers.  There is a need to evaluate new surgical techniques and emerging strategies to improve clinical outcomes.  Current surgical options include different attendant risks, but they lack independent assessment.  The use of pharmacologic therapies is largely empiric and would benefit from systematic evaluation.  Elucidation of the functional importance of genetic mutations associated with Marfan Syndrome has excellent potential for translation to therapeutic interventions, but is limited by difficulties in obtaining tissues for investigation and identification of kindred families by centers with expertise in genomic applications.  Animal models of Marfan syndrome demonstrate functional significance of genetic mutations and suggest new strategies for therapeutic prevention and treatment.  These findings require confirmation in patients.   A registry with a tissue repository would provide a needed resource for evaluation of disease progression and response to therapy, data for planning appropriate clinical trials, and tissue for genomic investigations, and ultimately facilitate improving treatment for the Marfan patient and possibly other patients with aortic aneurysmal disease.  Marfan Syndrome occurs in all races at a frequency of about 1 per 10,000 persons, and is often undiagnosed in life.  Marfan Syndrome is characterized by cardiovascular, skeletal and ocular disorders, and its cardiovascular complications result in premature death.  In the general population of persons over the age of 65 years, degenerative thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysmal disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality.  Rupture almost always results in death, and repair of aortic aneurysm is associated with significant morbidity.  Surgery to repair abdominal aortic aneurysm has significant operative risk for death and substantial morbidity.  Alternate strategies to slow non-Marfan degenerative aneurysms may be facilitated by insights learned about Marfan-related aortic disease which is a genetically triggered.  The connective tissue weakening associated with Marfan Syndrome has common and overlapping pathogenic pathways with degenerative aneurysmal diseases secondary to atherosclerosis and normal aging.  Thus, understanding and therapy for non-Marfan aneurysmal disease may benefit from new knowledge gained through the proposed registry. The registry would provide systematic collection of tissue and clinical data intended to provide information concerning diagnostic evaluation for the disease, complications, and outcomes.  The resultant data base will provide the capacity to evaluate treatments, such as surgical outcomes for aortic valve repair, pharmacologic interventions to reduce progression of aortic root dilatation, complications associated with anticoagulation associated with prosthetic valve, etc.  Specific treatment issues that might be addressed include: 1) Current issues in surgical management of aortic root disease in Marfan Syndrome.  (Timing of replacement surgery, valve sparing techniques, complications of anticoagulation, sex difference in utilization of surgery , etc.);  2) The role of afterload reduction in slowing progression of aortic dilation leading to valve replacement and anticoagulation; and 3) Optimal use of mechanical versus tissue valves.  The registry will support infrastructure to establish a Clinical and Data Coordinating Center, a tissue and blood repository, and a scientific advisory group to develop protocols for standard procedures to collect patient and procedure/treatment data, tissue, and blood samples for genomic and proteomic investigations.  Registry data would be analyzed to permit understanding of clinical outcomes, complications, and associated therapies.  The registry would serve as a resource to encourage research investigations using centrally collected tissue or data, and would provide information critical to the design of clinical investigations or trials of specific therapeutic interventions.  The proposed registry would build on the progress of the existing registries, and facilitate sharing of data without compromising confidentiality of patients or rights of independent investigators.  Participation of patient advocacy or other professional groups with NIH will facilitate access and maximize patient and family participation and the cooperation of their doctors.  NHLBI seeks comments and suggestions as requested below. 1.  Registry will collect a detailed data set in patients with various genetically-triggered cardiovascular complications of the aorta, including aneurysmal disease, valvular disease and heart failure and their treatment.  Patient outcomes are determined by patient characteristics, surgical provider and facilities support, and device performance. Please suggest data elements you consider essential for collection by the registry at the time entry and for follow-up.  2. A repository for blood and tissue is planned.  Please suggest ways to make the repository useful and accessible to investigators interested in advancing the diagnosis and treatment or advance pathophysiologic understanding of aortic aneurysmal disease or other genetically triggered complication of registry patients.  3. There are other registries of aortic aneurysmal disease and patients with connective tissue disorders.  Please suggest ways that the registry might collaborate or coordinate its data collection and analysis with existing registries.  4. Abstracting hospital and out-patient data and checking accuracy of submitted data will be required.  Please provide concerns you have about the registry collecting data on patients, hospitals and medical providers.  Please suggest ways the NHLBI can design registry protocols to minimize those concerns.  5. Please identify ways for NHLBI to encourage industry to participate and support the registry.  6. Because it is not likely that a single center or hospital has sufficient numbers of patients to support costs associated with a dedicated research coordinator, it is anticipated that patients will be recruited through regional centers responsible for specific large geographic areas.  Please suggest how regional centers might be identified and identify elements such as scientific and clinical expertise, patient facilities and services, a regional center requires to facilitate patient enrollment, treatment and data and tissue specimen collection required for the registry to be successful.  7. Please provide methods to ensure accuracy and security of data in the registry.  8. Please suggest strategies for the registry to become at least partially self-supporting.  9. We would appreciate any additional views or opinions that you think would be useful to develop a registry that will improve outcomes for patients with genetically triggered aortic aneurysmal disease including ways to improve identification of at risk patients, screening of families and therapy to arrest or alter progression of disease.  Responses in any of the areas are welcome; respondents should not feel compelled to address all items.  Please respond no later than August 13, 2004.  We look forward to your thoughts, opinions and suggestions and hope that you will share this document with your colleagues.  All responses will be kept confidential.  Thank you for your assistance.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a sole sources basis with the State of Alaska, Division of Health Care Services, 4730 Business Park Blvd., Ste. 18, Anchorage, Alaska 99503 .  The State of Alaska shall provide services to facilitate the development of and building of capacity to license and survey FESC by the agencies of State government responsible for such activities. The NAICS Code is 541990, 6.0 million.  The contractor is expected to work closely with other agencies of State government, providers across the State that currently provide extended care services, national experts on FESCs, and Federal staff from both CMS and HRSA.  If any providers in the State are participating in a FESC demonstration program through CMS or HRSA, the contractor will also be expected to work with those providers in the development of licensure and certification protocols.  The contractor is also expected to work with legal counsel on all aspects of this project.  Tasks that will be performed under this contract include the establishment of authority to license and certify FESCS, development of FESC conditions of participation and survey protocols, hiring of staff to conduct surveys of potential FESCs, and development of tools that other states can use to facilitate and expedite State licensure, survey and certification of FESCs. The Frontier Extended Stay Clinic (FESC) program and model were developed in part due to the interested and involvement of Alaska providers and officials in the FESC concept.  While FESC services are conducted at clinics in the “lower 48,” Alaska providers have significantly more experience in providing extended care services.  Primarily out of necessity, Alaska providers utilize FESC services more widely and more often that anywhere else in the country.  The State of Alaska has the most appropriate experience with FESC services; it is the only state capable of undertaking this project.  Within the State of Alaska, the Office of the Commissioner of Health and Social Services oversees all agencies of the State that are involved with the licensure and survey of health care facilities.  The Commissioner’s Office within the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services is the only organization that can perform the duties specified under this contract.  Any other organization that attempts to retrieve this type of privileged information would have to replicate their previous accomplishments.    This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not 
be recovered through competition, therefore, the State of Alaska, is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S. C. 253 (c), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a solicitation and published for information purposes only.  A copy of the Justification for Other Than Full and O pen Competition is 
on file.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Light Imaging Facility LIF) plans to procure an Axiovert 200 Motorized Research Microscope Upgrade for an existing LSM 510 system from Carl Zeiss Inc., One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594.  The LSM 510 was purchased in 1999 and is based on an Axiovert 100 microscope.  The Axiovert 100 does not have the optical components needed for optimal fluorescence imaging and is not fully compatible with the current version of the operating system because it lacks the capability for motorized control of the fluorescence sets and the condenser turret.  The purchase of an Axiovert 200MOT will provide improved optics and better compatibility with the operating system.  The upgrade will improve the performance of the entire confocal imaging system and allow it to be used for the most demanding applications, in particular, imaging fluorescence in living specimens.  The Axiovert 100 will be used as the base for a new conventional epifluorescence imaging setup.  This confocal microscope system is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the simplfied acquisition procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  Carl Zeiss Inc. is the only organization known to the NCI/NINDS researcher's which can provide the aforementioned upgrade on an existing LSM 510 system. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI/NINDS researchers to determine if the party can perform this requiement.  Please provide an original and one copy of the capability statements to the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT, on July 29, 2004.  All questions should be directed to Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on 301-402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The NAICS Code is 334516 and business size standard is 500 employees.  Reference RFQ-NCI-40073-NQ when responding/inquiring to the notice.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate for the National Homeland Security Research Center, located in Research Triangle Park, NC, on a sole source basis with California Analytical Instruments for a multigas analyzer monitoring system. The Innova Model 1412 Photoacoustic Multi-Gas Monitoring System is needed to measure the concentration of chloroethyl ethyl sulfate (Cees), dimethyl methyl phosphate (DMMP), perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PMCH), perfluorodimethylcyclohexane (PDCH), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as these chemical are used to simulate the deadly gases  terrorists might use in an attack on occupied buildings. The instrument can simultaneously measure DMMP, CEES, PMCH, PDCH, and SF6 while correcting for water vapor. Moreover, this instrument is selective in that narrow band optical filters are used to prevent absorption of interfering compounds.  Low volume sampling and flushing serve to provide rapid measurements that are required in these studies in order to follow the movement of gases within the indoor space. The instrument has a dynamic range that is 4 orders-of-magnitude higher than its detection limit for the compounds of interest.   This dynamic range provides coverage of chemicals from ppb through ppm levels. Finally, the instrument that has a low zero and span drift over several weeks to months time and has a span drift of less than 2.5% of the reading over 3 months.    EPA market research indicates this instrument is  exclusively distributed by California Analytical Instruments. However, any firm believing itself capable of supplying such an instrument may submit technical documentation establishing the potential of fulfilling EPA requirements. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of  electronic posting of this notice (before Friday, July 30, 2004 at 2:00 PM EST).  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of natural gas, water and wastewater systems at the U.S. Army Intelligence Center and Fort Huachuca, Fort Huachuca, Arizona.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacement.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the system(s) to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to own, operate, and maintain the utility system(s).  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc. of the systems to assure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, operate, and maintain the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offeror's shall be submitted as directed by the RFP.  The Installation and utility systems being privatized are described as follows:

The U.S. Army Intelligence Center and Fort Huachuca occupy over 73,000 acres in the San Pedro River valley in the Huachuca Mountains of southeastern Arizona.  The installation is situated approximately 70 miles southeast of Tucson and 10 miles north of the United States-Mexico border.
The installation supports approximately 7,000 military, 2,500 civilians, 2,000 contractors and 4,000 dependents, totaling an average daily population of 15,500.  Fort Huachuca also supports approximately 10,000 retirees and survivors.

Natural Gas System Description
The natural gas system at Fort Huachuca consists of approximately 416,700 feet of piping ranging from 1/2-inch to 8 inches in diameter.  The natural gas system has been the focus of a complete system replacement since 1993.  All steel pipe has been abandoned and replaced in that period with high density polyethylene (HDPE) yellow pipe.  Natural gas is used mostly for heating and cooking.  The system is currently in code compliance.  Consumption is approximately one million cubic feet per month of natural gas in the summer season, with usage peaking in winter months to 60 million cubic feet per month.  System pressure is 60 psi.  Some areas of the installation are served by propane;  the propane tanks that are to be replaced with natural gas connections as part of  this privatization action.
Water Distribution System Description
The water distribution system at Fort Huachuca consists of ground water supply, treatment, storage, and distribution.  The original water distribution system dates back to the 1940’s, but improvements and modifications have been made as needed since that time.  The Main Post area is served by six wells with capacities ranging from 500 to 800 gpm.  Two additional wells are located on the East Range with capacities of 1,400 gpm and 660 gpm. Each well is equipped with a chlorine feed system for disinfection and a fluoride feed system.  There are 20 monitoring wells at various locations throughout the fort.  The fort will retain ownership of the monitoring wells.  
The water distribution system is divided into four tiered pressure zones, separated by booster pumping stations and defined by the tank(s) that set the hydraulic grade line of the zone.
There are four booster pump stations located at Fort Huachuca.  Irwin and East Range pump stations are located on the East Range. East Range Pump Station consists of three 2,400-gpm capacity pumps.  Irwin Pump Station has five pumps, two with 1,500-gpm capacity and three with 2,400-gpm capacity.  Wherry and Greirson pump stations are located in the Main Post Area.  Wherry Pump Station has four pumps with capacities of 520 gpm, 590 gpm, 520 gpm, and 680 gpm.  Grierson Pump Station has three 500-gpm capacity pumps.  In addition, Wells #1 and #3 through #6 have one booster pump each with capacities ranging from 450 gpm to 900 gpm.  Well #2 has two booster pumps with capacities of 700 gpm each.
There are nine storage tanks at Fort Huachuca, in addition to seven surge tanks located at the wells.  There is one 500,000 gallon elevated storage tank and eight ground storage tanks ranging in capacity from 5,000 gallons to 3 million gallons.  Wells #1 through #6 each have a 50,000-gallon surge tank. Wells #7 and #8 share a 100,000-gallon surge tank.  All wells feed the 3 million gallon tank (Tank C). Wells #7 and #8 also have the capability to directly feed the 1.5 million gallon tank (Tank B).
The Main Post area includes approximately 507,000 feet of piping varying from 2 inches to 24 inches in diameter.  The average pressure in the system is 80 psi.  The age of the piping in the system ranges from 5 to 60 years.
Water usage at Fort Huachuca averages 1.5 million gallons per day as measured by pumpage. 
The Contractor shall be responsible for performing all sampling required by federal, state, and local regulations.  Presently, the Fire Department is responsible for testing and flushing of the water lines. The Contractor shall be responsible for performing these duties and submitting a report to the Fire Department.  The Government will retain ownership of fire suppression systems.

Wastewater Collection and Treatment System Description
The wastewater system at Fort Huachuca is concentrated mostly in the cantonment area and consists of collection piping, appurtenances, a treatment facility, recharge facilities and a non-potable irrigation system.  Fort Huachuca shall retain ownership of the treated effluent and control of the operation activities of the irrigation system in order to maintain compliance with the Fort’s Aquifer Protection Permit and Programmatic Biological Assessment and Opinion ,  (these documents can be found in the Technical Library).  The original system was constructed in the 1940’s, and improvements have been made as needed since that time.  All wastewater, primarily domestic sewage and limited vehicle washwater, produced in the cantonment area is treated at the Fort’s 2.0 million gallon per day (mgd) capacity wastewater treatment facility.  Average annual flow to the treatment facility is between approximately 750,000 gallons per day (gpd) and 1.0 mgd.  The treatment process includes a headworks, an oxidation ditch, clarifiers, effluent disinfection (both chlorination and ultra violet disinfection) and other processes including a sludge press, sludge drying beds and recharge ponds.
The wastewater collection system at Fort Huachuca consists of approximately 500,000 feet of gravity sewers and approximately 23,300 feet of force main.  There are approximately 1,400 manholes and 15 lift stations. 

Backup emergency generators that serve specific equipment of the wastewater system shall be conveyed as part of that particular system.  Seven lift stations (#1 - #7) and the Main Gate Lift Station have diesel emergency generators.

Effluent limitations, monitoring and reporting requirements are described in the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality NPDES permit and will be the responsibity of the plant operator.  An existing laboratory at the treatment facility is set up to perform sample monitoring. Currently, quarterly testing reports are submitted to ADEQ.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to HealthSoft, Inc., Orlando, FL, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  This action is being pursued on a sole-source basis because the Gove rnment believes that HealthSoft, Inc. is the only contractor with the specialized immunization-related expertise to provide an effective means to support standardized, comprehensive, and accessible vaccine education for Department of Defense (DoD) healthca re provider personnel, consisting of doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners, emergency unit personnel, and pharmacists.  The vaccine education tool is the Project Immune Readiness (PIR) Learning Management System, a web-based tool with a total of approxim ately 30 distance learning modules (existing and planned, one for each vaccine and the related disease).  To elevate the competency of the DoDÃ¢Â€Â™s healthcare providers, the desired program is for these personnel to take the modules and then have each pr ovider take a competency exam containing basic immunization information and specialized vaccine-related information related to the providerÃ¢Â€Â™s speciality.  The PIR consists of new modules (module for Allergy Reaction Prevention; module for Medical Mana gement of Anaphylaxis; module for one IND Vaccine plus two Vaccines currently under development; training module for Tuberculosis BCG Vaccine Administration and TB Skin Testing; module for immunogloblin), updating 21 existing PIR modules, and the creation of a certification exam for each of the four categories of military healthcare providers.  USAMRAA intends to award this requirement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The period of performance is for a period of 36 months (1 August 2004 to 31 July 2007).  The contractor shall provide both expert vaccine-based knowledge and the ability to program this information into a distance learning web-based module for DoD vaccine providers.  Interested respondents who feel that they are capable of meeting thes e requirements may identify their interest by submitting technical documentation and resumes demonstrating capability to Dana Herndon at FAX No. 301-619-3002 by 30 July 2004.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

The Past Performance will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.

The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.

Past performance is slightly more important than price.  Include with quotes performance and price information as follows:  (A) PERFORMANCE - provide a list of projects similar in scope and magnitude to the work required under this solicitation which the offeror has completed during the last 3 years. For each project, include (i) Name of the project; (ii) Description of the work; (iii) Contract number, date and type; (iv) Name and address of the acquiring Government agency or commercial customer; (v) Initial contract amount and final contract amount; (vi) Any problems encountered in performance of the work and corrective action(s) taken; and (vii) Name(s) and telephone number(s) of references from the acquiring agency or customer who may be contacted for further information.  (B) PRICE - provide (i) Material costs; (ii) Equipment to be used; (iii) Crew size to include function of each crew member (foreman, laborer, etc); (iv) Number of labor hours per crew member; (v) Hourly rate per crew member.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of sources for turf maintenance and ice and snow removal services for general and selected areas. This requirement is to provide a comprehensive Turf Maintenance and, Ice and Snow Removal Program. The areas with service requirements include the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Bethesda, Maryland campus and the National Institutes of Health Animal Center (NIHAC) Poolesville, Maryland campus.  The anticipated performance requirements consist of a basic period of twelve months with four, one-year consecutive option periods. 

The successful contractor shall furnish any and all the requested services by providing the necessary qualified personnel, material, equipment, tools and supplies as needed and in a timely manner to perform the requested services. 
The area for turf services at the Bethesda campus is approximately 59.45 hectares with an estimated number of 36 mowings/trimmings required per season.  Up to four complete edging of pavement areas may be required.  Up to 16 hectares may be selected for turf aerifying, over-seeding and fertilization and up to 100 hectares may be selected for leaf removal. The NIHAC, Poolesville campus encompasses approximately 112.9 hectares of which approximately 40.9 hectares comprise fine lawns and approximately 72.0 hectares of fenced pasture fields. The remaining acreage is heavily wooded.  Approximately 34 fine lawn mowings and up to 4 pasture mowings will be required per season. 
The ice and snow removal services will generally consist of a comprehensive control and removal program for accumulations on the Bethesda and Poolesville campuses between November 01 and April 15 of the contract year.  This shall include (I) Pedestrian Areas (all building entrances, all nitrogen/oxygen tank areas, all flag pole access walks, all shuttle bus stops/shelters, all security entrance shelters and pedestrian turnstiles, all loading docks and steps and all playground areas and all sidewalks/bike paths); (II) Roads and Parking Lots (all road, parking lot, parking garage top decks and ramps); (III) Handicap Parking (all exposed handicap parking spaces and access isles); and (IV) NIH Animal Center (a comprehensive program of all campus pedestrian areas, roads, parking lots, service areas, steps, handicap parking and sidewalks). 
The value for these services may exceed $1,000,000.00 per year.

The Government reserves the right to decide the method of procurement strategy, i.e., 8(a) contracting or service-disabled small business set-aside, based on the response to this market survey. 

If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number as well as size and type of ownership for the organization, i.e., small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), woman-owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) concern, Veteran, and or Service-disabled Veteran; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements to demonstrate that small business prime contractors can maintain labor, technical, and management control of the project, meeting the limitations on subcontracting imposed on small business set-asides. Although no geographic restriction is anticipated, if responding organizations are located outside the Washington Metropolitan area, indicate how the organization would coordinate with the agency program office to provide support to multiple sites. The Government will evaluate the capability information using the following criteria: 1) potential technical capability to provide the administrative support services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice; 2) capacity to secure and apply the full range of human and technical resources required to successfully perform these requirements; 3) potential capability to implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with program schedules; meeting and tracking performance; hiring and retention of key personnel; and 4) potential to provide services under a performance based service acquisition contract .
Interested firms responding to this survey are encouraged to structure capability statements in the order of the area of consideration noted above.  Responding firms should provide three (3) copies of a tailored capability statement to the above noted address within ten (10) business days from the date of publication of this notice. 

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs
incurred.

<DESC>The Pentagon Renovation Office is soliciting technical proposals for the Pentagon Officer’s Athletic Center (POAC) Conversion construction project. The project requires the design and construction conversion of an existing partially earth sheltered building of approximately 120,000 – 121,500 sf.  The facility currently houses a fitness center that will be converted into a resource center.  The resource center will include:  a conference center; an informal restaurant; a library and a police station. Scope of the project may include: demolition, abatement of asbestos, lead paint, and other hazardous material; soil fill (existing indoor swimming pool is below grade); waterproofing of the River Terrace; general repairs to the concrete exterior walls, replacement of a substantial part of the existing concrete slab-on-grade supported by new structure; tie into existing steam, chilled water, sanitary sewer, and electrical systems on site; and construction of a partial second floor.  The acquisition will be accomplished utilizing two-phase design-build selection procedures.  The Phase I solicitation is anticipated to be issued on or about May 14, 2003.  Offers submitted in response to Phase I will be evaluated to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase II, which is anticipated to be released on or about July 13, 2003.  No hard copies of the solicitation or any amendments will be issued.  One contract will be awarded using best value competitive procedures.  The estimated cost range for this project is between $20,000,000 and $50,000,000.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. This constitutes Amendment 0002 to combined synopsis/solicitation N00178-04-R-1063 for Grounding Systems and Installation at five Space Surveillance System field stations.  This effort consists of providing and installing grounding cots/electrodes near radar buildings/towers at the field stations.  The ground must be less than 2 ohms at all sites and will require that the ground be connected to the existing inter ior/exterior drop location.  All conduits should be Schedule 80 PVC.  The amount of ditching/piping will depend on the solution proposed.  A vertical grounding system can be located closer to the building while a horizontal system will have to be further from the building.  All sites have room for the vertical system within 50 feet of the proposed ground wire entrance into the building.  Proposed locations of the grounding cots are contained on AutoCAD drawings available at http://www.nswc.navy.mil/supply.  The following Ground Resistivity Measurements are provided and all measurements were single point taken at a depth of 25 feet within an AEMC 4610:  Hawkinsville, Georgia – P = 6,415 ohms/cm, Ground Condition = Moist, Weather – Sunny and 84ºF; Jordan Lake, Alabama – P = 42,704 ohms/cm, Ground Condition = Wet, Weather = Cloudy and 88ºF; Silver Lake, Mississippi – P = 1,053 ohm s/cm, Ground Condition = Standing Water, Weather = Cloudy and 87ºF; Red River, Arkansas – P = 479 ohms/cm, Ground Condition = Wet, Weather = Partly Cloudy and 83ºF; and Gila River, Arizona – P = 861 ohms/cm, Ground Condition = Wet, Weather = Sunny and 106ºF.  Site Borings and Observations:  Hawkinsville, Georgia – Borings from antenna modernization in 1987: 0-3 feet – Firm brown slightly clayey sand, 3-10 feet – Firm gray clayey to very clayey sand, Most borings stop at 10 feet due to needs at the time.  What borings do go down to 20 feet around the site show continuance of the 3-10 feet layer; Jordan Lake, Alabama – Borings from well drilled in 1965: 0-6 feet – Top Soil, 6-40 feet – Mixture of Sand, Clay and Gravel, 40-70 feet – Clay and Gravel, 70-95 feet – Soft Rock, and 95-155 feet – Hard Granite; Silver Lake, Mississippi – Borings from antenna modernization in 1986: 0-10 f eet – Clay, firm to stiff.  Some borings show iron deposits.  Some borings filled back to 6 feet or so, with water.  Ground water is a serious problem – standing water is evident in the spring; Red River; Arkansas – Borings from antenna modernization in 1987: 0-6 feet – Clay, stiff grey, 6-10 feet – Clay, stiff brown, 10-22 feet – Sand, brown fine, None of the borings back filled with water although ground water should be a consideration here.  Parts on the field stay wet in the spring and during rainy weather; and Gila River, Arizona – Borings from 1997 septic system project: 0-11 feet – fine sand, 11-18 feet – Coarse Sand, 18-30 feet – Silt, 30-40 feet – Clay, and 40-50 feet – River Sand and Gravel.  Ground water should be taken into consideration at the Arkansas and Mississippi sites.  Both sites are just above sea level and both field stations can be under water for parts o f the year.  In the Mississippi location, holes over 6 feet will fill with water in the spring.  During the summer, the ground turns rock hard and visible fissures can be seen over the surface of the ground.  Field station personnel/Government representatives must sign off on any ditching done and must be present at the time of installation.  Installation will occur at the Hawkinsville, Georgia; Wetumpka, Alabama; Hollandale, Mississippi; Lafayette County, Arkansas; and Maricopa, Arizona Space Surveillance System field stations.  No deliveries or installation will occur on Federal Holidays.  Delivery and installation is required as follows:  Red River, Arkansas-not later than 13 August 2004; Silver Lake, Mississippi-not later that 19 August 2004; Jordan Lake, Alabama-not later than 24 August 2004; Hawkinsville, Georgia-not later than 31 August 2004; and Gila River, Arizona-not  later than 16 September 2004.

<DESC>The Library of Congress FEDLINK Program requires accounting services to pay invoices for federal libraries who borrow from libraries that charge for lending materials.  Federal libraries that use this Interlibrary Loan (ILL) Payment Service will be participating in the Federal Library and Information Center Committee (FLICC) FEDLINK cooperative program and will establish accounts with LC/FEDLINK to pay for the charges they incur. The ILL Payment Service vendor will pay the lending libraries' certified invoices and will then bill the borrowing library's LC/FEDLINK account for reimbursement for the amount paid to the lender and for a service fee.  The vendor will provide the borrowing library with detailed reports and summaries of lender invoices paid.  This service is designed for payments, not collections.  That is, the vendor is to pay institutions that photocopy or lend materials from their collection to federal libraries; the vendor is not to collect from borrowers (individuals or institutions) fees that federal libraries themselves may charge when they photocopy or lend materials. The FEDLINK ILL fee payment service provides an efficient method for federal libraries to pay ILL fees that may be charged by lending institutions to cover the cost of photocopying or other interlibrary loan processing costs.  Instructions for submitting proposals are specified in Section L of RFP# S-LC04019. All proposals must be submitted to the address as specified in Section L of the solicitation.  Vendors are responsible for ensuring that all amendments are received prior to submittal of proposals. Please check this site periodically for amendments or clarifications to the RFP. For information about the Library of Congress' FEDLINK Program, please visit our website at www.loc.gov/flicc. For additional information about other FEDLINK services, please contact Jim Oliver, FEDLINK Vendor Services Coordinator, at joli@loc.gov.

<CONTACT>DIANA ROMERO PURCHASING AGENT 3032369327     DLROMERO@USGS.GOV;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Water Resources Division (WRD), has a requirement for water quality monitoring systems, probes, and related parts. Equipment shall include YSI 6600 with dissolved oxygen probe, rapid pulse DO probe, ph/ORP probe, turbidity probe, flying lead adapter, 650 handheld unit with barometer, field cable, 690 sonde weight, conductivity/temperature probe. The YSI equipment was found to provide the most accurate measurements of dissolved oxygen, a critical water quality parameter for the protection of aquatic life.  These are non-stirring units and will not interfere with data collection (D.O. and p.H) readings. This is an important advantage, as our fieldwork will be conducted in waters with dense submerged vegetation where apparatuses such as stirrers are easily fouled or jammed by plant debris YSI technology includes certain "fail-safe" features including a constant readout of "dissolved oxygen charge" to determine when this probe requires maintenance and a low-battery shut off capability. Based on the information available at this time and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the equipment as a sole-source from Yellow Springs Instruments 1725 Brannum Lane, Yellow Springs, OH 45387 or from an authorized dealer as approved by YSI, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Vendors who feel that they can furnish the equipment are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and other materials that correspond to the required services stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  No solicitation document exists, therefore, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement. See numbered note 22. Responses to this notice must be submitted via e-mail to: dlromero@usgs.gov by 08/29/2004.

<DESC>Over the past seven years, the Border Patrol has incorporated various electronic surveillance technologies within the current Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS) to assist its agents in preventing illegal aliens, smugglers, narcotics and other contraband from entering the United States. These technologies have included seismic sensors, video surveillance systems (day and night), and monitoring equipment. 

The Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System Program Office of the U.S. Border Patrol is pleased to announce an Industry Day for potential vendors seeking to offer services for the ISIS America’s Shield Initiative. The purpose of the Industry Day is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities.  Although the Government does not intend to award a contract at this time, this Industry Day is one of the preliminary steps for a future acquisition to acquire an integrated system that will:

•	Maintain the operational capability of the currently installed systems;
•	Increase the amount of border covered by electronic surveillance to serve as a force-multiplier for currently manual “line-watch” methods;
•	Provide improved situational awareness and interoperability with other law enforcement agencies;
•	Decrease the life-cycle cost for the system as it continues to increase in size and capability;
•	Meet the enterprise architecture and technology reference model standards. 

As space is limited, it is required that interested vendors limit their attendance to two representatives per company.  The sessions will provide information on the current ISIS system, the Border Patrol Mission, History and new National Strategy. 

The Industry Day will be held on Wednesday, August 5, 2004.  The event will be held in the Auditorium of the MITRE McLean conference center at 7515 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA.    Prior registration is required.    Please forward the following information by e-mail to asi@mitre.org:

Attendee Name
Attendee Date of Birth
Attendee Social Security Number
Company Name
Attendee e-mail address, telephone number and fax number 

NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  Questions should reference announcement number GS05T04BQ0006.    Please ensure that questions or other feedback submitted includes company name, point of contact, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address. RESPONSES TO THESE NOTICES ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT. ALL INORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS PROPERLY IDENTIFIED AS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.

<CONTACT>Linda Schmidt, 732-427-1323
<DESC>The Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center and PM Navigation Systems are seeking sources for providing low cost combat identification solutions that may satisfy the Army's current and future force requirements.  The purpose of this announcement is to survey the availability of technology to improve fielded thermal panel technology and information on other potential non-cooperative and cooperative technologies.  Fielded Combat Identification Panels (CIP) are approximately 24 inch es X 30 inches in size and covered on one side with low emissivity high reflective thermal tape that requires no power source to work.  The CIP is attached to the vehicle with bolts, Velcro or mounting frames.  When viewed through Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) thermal sensors, the CIP shows up as a contrasting cold spot on the hot target image.  In the engagement process, a gunner will use this contrast to assist in his determination if the targeted vehicle is friendly.  The CIP are mounted to provide all  aspect coverage; however, terrain features, such as trees and other vegetation, proper defilade firing positions, and other obstacles will break up the thermal image of any vehicle.  Also, CIP performance is degraded in environmental conditions that affec t the thermal imaging device performance.  These conditions include:  dense fog, rain, and severely overcast skies.  Each vehicle has from three to six panels and in addition, a cloth panel is secured to the top of the vehicle to provide air to ground iden tification.  The Government is interested in ideas and technologies that may improve performance while reducing the susceptibility and vulnerability of these CIP, thereby extending their useful life.  The Government is also interested in ideas technologies  to provide low cost ground to ground and air to ground combat identification.  Low cost is considered to be $5000 per system, installed on a combat platform.  Further request scientific rationale to substantiate submitted ideas.  This survey is also issue d IAW the requirements of FAR Part 10 to determine the applicability of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  Interested sources should provide requested documentation to Mr. David Concilio, PM Navigation Systems, ATTN:  SFAE-IEW&S-NS, Building 56 3, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey  07703.  Mr. Concilio can be reached at 732-427-5045.  This announcement is to gather information only but may be utilized to shape future technology investment.  Information should be received no later than close of business o n 16 August 2004.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey of industry is to identify production sources for the Hand Grenade, Riot, CS M7A3, NSN 1330-00-965-0802.  The M7A3 grenade is used to control counter-insurgencies and for other tactical missions.  It i s a burning type riot control grenade and may be used to simulate casualty agents during training.  The M7A3 is a CS filled burning type grenade used to control counterinsurgencies and other tactical missions.  The CS agent is emitted between 15 and 35 sec onds during which time incapacitation is onset.  The duration of incapacitation is about 10 minutes after personnel are removed to fresh air. The grenade with the M201A1 fuze is 5.7 inches long and weighs 15.5 ounces. The sheet metal body, the same used on  the M18 grenade, is 4.65 inches long and has a diameter of 2.5 inches.  A fill made of 7.35 oz. burning fuel mixture and 4.5 oz. of sugar coated ortho chlorolbenzalmalonitrile (CS) pellets is then pressed into the body.  A starter mix is added to the top of the fill.  The M201A1 fuze is a pyrotechnic delay-igniting fuze. Delay time is between 0.7 Ã¢Â€Â“ 2 seconds. The fuze body contains a primer (M39A1), first-fire mixture pyrotechnic delay column and ignition mixture. Assembled to the fuze body are a stri ker, striker spring, safety lever and safety pin with a pull ring.  The grenade body is painted gray with red band and the fuze is painted gray or olive drab with black marking.  Since the sheet metal body and the M201A1 fuze are common to other munitions and are available under separate Government contracts , the Government is considering the possibility of  making them available as Government Furnished Material (GFM).  The CS pellets may also be acquired by the Government and provided as GFM. Any input in  regard to these items or any portion of these components being provided as GFM is also requested.  Estimated quantity is 58,200 each M7A3 Hand Grenade, Riot CS.  A respondent to this market survey must have available a majority of the skills and facilitie s that are required to manufacture the M7A3 Hand Grenade, Riot CS.  If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate his ability to obtain those resources in a  timely fashion.  Interested companies who feel they possess the necessary capabilities should respond by providing the Government the following information; A brief summary of the company's capabilities, description of facilities, personnel and related ma nufacturing experience; estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities, the associated prices and the maximum procurement quantity required for production.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors,  those vendors or subcontractors must meet these criteria.  Information shall be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to:  Janet Batson, email batsonj@osc.army.mil.  This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.  The Government will utilize th e information provided for planning purposes only.  All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.

<SUBJECT>99--24-BIT 96-CHANNEL DDR
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to DaqScribe Technologies, Inc., Centennial, CO.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Delivery Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center's Dynamic Test Branch requires a 24-bit, 96-channel, state-of-the-art Digital Data Recorder (DDR).  The total estimated cost of this procurement is $72,000.00. The DDR would allow for simultaneous recording and playback and, since it records digitally, the data does not have to be digitized.  The media for the DDR is off the shelf RAID hard drives which are swappable even while the DDR is powered on.  This means that recording never has to stop and the cost of the media relative to the storage capability is excellent.  Maintaining the ability to record and simultaneously playback and analyze vibration control and shock test data is a critical capability requirement in allowing the Dynamic Test Branch to perform its test mission. This DDR also has the capacity to record at very high rates (2.5 megasamples per second) and at very large throughputs (400 megabytes per second).  These rates are required for high frequency pyroshock testing performed at the Dynamic Test Branch.  Currently, DaqScribe Technologies, Inc. is the only vendor that manufactures a product with this capability. In order to use another vendor's system from any company other than DacScribe Technologies, Inc. would result in a much higher initial cost, mismatched hardware, since all required channels could not be procured, and would reduce the efficiency of operations due to inconsistencies encountered by having multiple recording mediums.  The use of an alternate source would result in a duplication of effort and cost that would not be recovered through competition.  Therefore, due to time, compatibility, and related cost issues, no other vendor other than DaqScribe Technologies, Inc. meets the requirements.  RTTC has determined that the equipment required is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. Award to a vendor other than DaqScribe Technologies, Inc. would result in the acquisition of substandard equipment that will not meet mission requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST July 27, 2004, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  POC:  James L.

<SUBJECT>99--Enabling Metadata Development in Biodiversity and Ecosystem Sciences: A Users Perspective
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service/GovWorks, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Eric B. Landis, Stillwater, MN.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Contract in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the United States Geological Survey.  The USGS has a requirement for the acquisition of a study to focus on metadata users and analyzes how metadata is being used in the biological community. It identifies and provides recommendations for best policies and practices for use by natural resource management agencies to facilitate metadata use and access by their user community.  The objectives of this project are to: 1.Analyze and document current uses for biological and spatial metadata from user communities in science, and government organizations.  2.Determine how metadata websites and Clearinghouses are being accessed and used for metadata retrieval and analysis.  3.Develop and disseminate guidelines and best practices for the improvement of metadata dissemination and structure, based on user needs. The estimated total value of this project is $30,000.  Eric B. Landis brings this project to the FGDC based on observations and comments from metadata training that he has performed for other organizations.  His established network spans Federal, state, local, and tribal governments.  Because of his long involvement with these groups, Mr. Landis has established a level of trust that allows him to network freely and receive comments on personal, internal, cultural, and bureaucratic obstacles in implementing metadata as a process in GIS and other geographic-base data activities. Eric B. Landis is the only vendor with the extensive established network necessary to complete this project. Eric B. Landis is recognized in the geospatial community and will be able to utilize his reputable trust and reliability so that these communities will confidently and confidentially relay the cultural, bureaucratic, and other roadblocks to the creation of metadata. No other vendors have the capability to acquire the extensive network that Eric B. Landis currently possesses. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST July 26, 2004, will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>R -- Pharmaceutical Services Support Center
<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis with American Pharmaceutical Association (APA), 2215 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20037 to modify and expand the level of effort to contract 232-02-0003 in order to continue to provide technical assistance to entities newly eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program, particularly small, rural and urban hospitals that will soon meet the eligibility requirements for the 340B Program due to recent changes in Federal law.  Additional services to be provided are the development of a register for the 340B Program to be able to handle and service as many as thousand of these newly eligible hospitals.  It is also necessary to provide additional technical assistance to the grantees of the HIV/AIDS Assistance Branch of HRSA.  APA is deemed the only responsible source capable to fulfill the requirement without substantial duplication of costs which would not be expected to be recovered through competition under the authority in 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source.  This is a notice of intent, not a request for competitive proposals.  The contact person is: Frantz Y. Richard, Contracting Officer, Contracts Operations Branch, Division of Procurement Management, OMPS/HRSA, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A-19, Rockville, MD 20857; phone number 301-443-0687; FAX 301-443-6038.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development, Testing and Evaluation of a Live Attenuated Tularemia Vaccine Candidate
<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, (DMID), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, a modification to its current contract with DynPort Vaccine Company (DVC) for additional current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) of a clinical grade Tularemia vaccine candidate.  In October of 2003, NIAID entered into a collaborative research agreement with the US Department of Defense to complete ongoing preclinical and product testing of this vaccine and file an Investigational New Drug, (IND), with the goal of conducting a phase 1 clinical trial. As part of this interagency collaboration, NIAID awarded a non-competitive contract to DVC as the developer of the manufacturing process.  Work currently includes preclinical testing and support for compilation of an Investigational New Drug  (IND) submission. This modification will provide for continued development of the vaccine candidate.  Tasks include manufacture of an additional cGMP clinical lot and its release and stability testing, suitable to support the use of this product in continuing clinical investigations. Inherent duplication of cost to the government and the difficulty in developing a new product make competition unfeasible for this project.  See Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Standard Form (SF) 330 for Architect-Engineer Qualifications is effective 8 June 2004, and replaces SFs 254 and 255.  The form has two parts: Part I, Contract-Specific Qualifications, and Part II, General Qualifications.  Part II of the form can now to submitted electronically to the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  ORCA is part of the Federal-wide Business Partner Network (BPN) and can be found at http://www.bpn.gov/.  Click on VENDOR under ORCA on the left side of the screen to submit your information. The SF 330 Part II is Question 26 in ORCA; the preceding questions must also be answered.  Firms must first have a DUNS Number and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system.  (CCR can be also be ac cessed from the BPN website.)  Firms will also need their Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) generated from CCR to access ORCA.  The information submitted through ORCA is available, in a read-only format, to the public.  Part II is prepared on a branch office basis, which aligns with the assignment of DUNS Numbers.  Submission of the SF 330 Part II to ORCA is voluntary.  However, it will increase a firms visibility in the Federal marketplace and may lead to opportunities for contracts that are e xempt from public announcement.  The information submitted to ORCA is available to the public.  Do not submit a SF 254 or a SF 330 Part II to the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS).  ACASS will be modernized in late 2004 to r etrieve the SF 330 Part II data from ORCA and make it available to contracting agencies.  Until then, agencies will typically require A-E firms to submit Parts II with Part I when responding to a solicitation of A-E services.  A Part II is required for eac h branch office of the prime firm and any subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract.  After ACASS is modernized, contracting agencies have the option of requesting firms submit Part II with Part I or retrieving Part II from ACASS if  a firm has one on file in ORCA.  You may direct any policy questions on the SF 330 Part II to Marilyn Nedell at the ACASS Center at 503-808-4590, or by e-mail at caic.nwp@nwp01.usace.army.mil.  Use the Help feature on ORCA for general questions about the use of ORCA.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the ONLY solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is AB133F-O4-CN-0072 and is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  This procurement will be conducted using simplified acquisition procedures under FAR Part 15.  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 97-17.  Any resulting contract from this solicitation will be a firm-fixed price, delivery date is required 45 days after the order is placed; FOB Honolulu, HI.  The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) code is 513340.  the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) has a requirement for 26 pop-up satellite archival transmitting tags (PSATS) with the following specifications: 1) PSAT tags must be capable of collecting up to 500 days worth of data on ambient temperature, light levels, ambient pressure (i.e., depth), and battery voltage; then download the stored processed, and/or summarized data to the ARGOS system of satellites after jettisoning on a specified date, or at a specified date, or at a specified number of days after deployment. 2) The tag and/or attending software must be able to provide daily times of sunrise and sunset and/or coordinates of longitude and latitude during the period of deployment. Accuracy should be within 2 degrees of latitude and longitude. 3) Software must be supplied by the manufacturer for downloading, collating and parsing of tag derived data or derived and collated data is to be supplied by the manufacturer. 4) Downloaded pressure (depth) and temperature data from ARGOS must be ultimately provided as individual raw values collected at a rate of acquisition to the user (at the very least, on an hourly basis). (Data must not be provided as collated summaries over a given time period. 5) The tag and/or attending on-board software must also be capable of measuring, recording and downloading the “attitude” of the tag (animal).  These data are needed to determine whether the tag actually stayed on the animal (i.e., horizontal) until it jettisoned at the programmed date, or whether the animal perished after tagging and the tag was free floated (i.e., vertical). 6) The tags must be re-programmable after manufacture, such that the onboard software and date the tag is programmed to jettison can be updated.  These programming tasks should be doable by end users, or by the manufacturer at minimal or no cost. 7) Due to adverse and unpredictable conditions, tags must be activated by a simple method (e.g. removal of battery to activate PSAT) whilst in the filed that does not necessitate a computer interface. 8) In order to conserve battery life but also to aid in data throughput, the PSAT should only transmit data when there is a ARGOS satellite footprint encompassing the location of the tag. 9) A fail-safe device that prevents data loss if the animal sinks and the attached tag implodes. This device would sever the connection before tag implosion, thereby sending the tag transmitter to float to the surface to download data.  The following clauses and provisions are applicable to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference as follows: FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial applies to this acquisition and there are no addenda to this provision; Offers shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3,offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with offer; FAR clause 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial items; FAR 52,212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.

The full text of clauses referenced herein may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far/.  (iv). This acquisition is reserved for small businesses. The requirements will be fulfilled using the Simplified Acquisition procedures, Part 13 of the FAR, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, to the maximum extent possible. The associated North American Classification System (NAICS) code is 561310. The small business size standard is 500 employees.  (v).

(vi).  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) with its headquarters presently located in Arlington, Virginia. The mission of the USPTO is the examination and issuance of patents and the examination and registration of trademarks. The USPTO serves the interest of inventors and businesses with respect to their inventions and corporate products, and service identifications. It also advises and assists the bureaus and offices of the Department of Commerce and other agencies of the Government in matters involving “intellectual property.” The USPTO has a requirement for the services of an executive search firm to assist the agency in identifying potential candidates for executive positions (i.e., Senior Executive Service and other executive positions) within the USPTO. The immediate requirements under CLIN 001 are for the identification of (1) an individual to serve as the Deputy Chief Information Officer; and (2) an individual to serve as the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Operations. The Office of the Chief Information Office (OCIO) serves as the principal Information Technology (IT) advisor to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. The USPTO is supported by an IT infrastructure of hardware, system software, and network communications that have been deployed in support of the mission of the USPTO. The IT infrastructure provides access to application systems and office automation tools used in the performance of the work processes. The Deputy Chief Information Officer is responsible for OCIO-wide administrative and product assurance services that improve the quality of our systems, products, and services and allows the other OCIO offices to focus on core mission objectives. The Deputy CIO supports the Chief Information Officer in the areas of information technology governance; technical policy and planning; budget formulation and execution, project and resource management, information technology acquisition, and systems product assurance. The Deputy CIO provides administrative and policy guidance to the CIO on a broad range of matters affecting the management of the USPTO’s information resource management program. The Trademark Organization supports the mission of the USPTO through the examination and registration of trademarks and by providing notice of marks in use that assist businesses in protecting their goods and services and safeguard consumers against confusion in the marketplace. The Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Operations serves under the general administrative direction of the Commissioner for Trademarks and oversees all operations matters in support of the examination and processing of applications filed for the Federal registration of a trademark. The Deputy Commissioner provides leadership and administrative and legal oversight for examining operations. The Deputy Commissioner is responsible for strategic planning; program planning to project workloads and resource requirements; performance management to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of programs; project management for integrating information technology and reengineered business processes; and advancing e-government and other means to increase the efficiency of operations and expand services in support of the trademark user community. Vacancy announcements for these two SES positions are attached.  (vii).  Schedule: The contractor will be required to meet with the designated Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) (to be designated at time of award) to review contract requirements within 2 weeks of contract award. The contractor will be required to provide, in writing, detailed search, recruitment, and marketing plans envisioned to locate qualified individuals and steps that the contractor will take to advertise the position.

To be considered for the positions, the potential candidates are required to submit an application in accordance with the vacancy announcements as attached. The Contractor is required to refer to the USPTO only those candidates from whom the contractor has not accepted fees except those permitted under 5 C.F.R. §300.404(b). Contractor may not imply that it is the sole or primary avenue for employment with the USPTO. Contractor will recruit and refer candidates in accordance with applicable merit principles and equal opportunity laws.  Place of delivery will vary but most deliveries will go to the present USPTO headquarters located in Crystal City, Arlington, VA 22202, or to its new location in Alexandria, VA.  (viii).  The provision at 52.212.1, Instructions to Offerors– Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  (ix). The provision at 52.212.2, Evaluation – Commercial Items, will be used to evaluate offerors for awarding a contract.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time consuming litigation.

The Government will evaluate the offeror’s record of conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship, and will evaluate the offeror’s record on cost control/change orders and adherence to contract schedules.  Subcontractor management, safety management and other quality control programs will also be reviewed.  The Government will examine the offeror’s record for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and in general, the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Clauses may be viewed or downloaded by accessing the website at: http://www.arnet.gov/far.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL BE ISSUED. 

EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS:

The Government will make award based on technical compliance, past performance, and price.

Past Performance

A quoter shall include a list of the ten most recent current of complete contracts and subcontracts occurring during the past three years.  Contracts listed may include those entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local government, and commercial entities.  Quoters that are newly formed entities without prior contract should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for all key personnel.  Quoters should provide a point of contact, address, and phone number for each contract.  The quoter may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts and subcontracts identified and may describe corrective actions taken to resolve those problems.  Quoters should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts.  General performance information will be obtained by the Government from the references.  

Each quoter will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services.  Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which quoters’ relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the Government.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  Past performance will be scored and the Government’s conclusions about overall quality of the quoter’s past performance will be highly influential in determining the relative merits of the quotation and in selecting the quotation considered most advantageous to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to use past performance information obtained from other than the sources identified by the quoter.  Information may be utilized from the references provided in the quotation, other customers known to the BOP, consumer protection organizations, and other who may have useful and relevant information.  Information may also be considered regarding any significant subcontractor and key personnel records.

The Government will evaluate the quality of the quoter’s past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capacity of the quoter and the other competitors.  Consequently, a quoter with an exceptional record of past performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is acceptable.  If a quoter, or the proposed employees for the quoter, do not have a past performance history relating to this solicitation, the quoter will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on this factor.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the quoter has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services/supplies at fair and reasonable prices.  This is a matter of judgment.  Quoters may be given an opportunity to address especially unfavorable reports of past performance, and the quoter’s response, or lack of, will be taken into consideration.  A quoter’s opportunity to address reports of negative past performance information could be affected by the Government’s entitlement to award without discussions.  Quoters would be well served to be aware of possible dissatisfied customers and address expected negative issues in the initial quotation.  Generally, negative information obtained from a quoter’s references is considered historical in nature, not subject to change, and not a matter for discussions.  By evaluating past performance, the Government intends to consider the quoter’s record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the quoter’s adherence to contract schedules, including administrative aspects of performance; the quoter’s reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the quoter’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Past performance subfactors to be evaluated are: quality of product or service; timeliness of performance; business relations; and customer satisfaction.  

SUBMISSION OF QUOTATIONS:

Quotations shall be submitted on or before the quotation deadline specified below.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation.  Quoters will be required to submit the following information on letterhead or business stationery, directly to the contracting officer.

1.  Completed Schedule of Items
2.  Offerors Representations and Certifications (FAR 52.212-3)
3.  A clear description of the product(s) offered, to include identification of brand and product name.  Product samples may be requested.
4.  A list of the ten most recent contracts awarded to the quoter or a major subcontractor, to include a point of contact, address, and phone number, from whom the Government will seek past performance information.  

All quoters are advised that this solicitation includes the clause at FAR 52.212-4 for commercial items which at paragraph (t), Central Contractor Registration (CCR), requires all contractors doing business with the Federal Government after September 30, 2003, to be registered in the CCR database.  Quoters should include their Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number in their quotes.  The Contracting Officer will verify registration in the CCR database prior to award by entering the potential awardee’s DUNS number into the CCR database.  Failure to complete the registration procedures outlined in this clause may result in elimination from consideration for award.  

The above information must be received at the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Field Acquisition Office, Armed Forces Reserve Complex, 346 Marine Forces Drive, Grand Prairie, TX 75051 on or before 2:00 P.M. CST on August 9, 2004.  Quotations may be faxed to 972-352-4545 or e-mailed to mrouanzion@bop.gov.  Please call 972-352-4522 to verify receipt of quotations.

Questions and Answers
to (RFQ)APHIS-32KW-04-041
July 15, 2004
1) 	Regarding the opportunity posted, it does not specify whether you are looking for an "off the shelf" product, versus a custom developed product, or even a combination of the two.  Our company can work in a number of ways to accommodate this request, but we would like to know if any of these are more preferred over the others.  What is your preference for the application you are requesting, or doesn't it matter, as long as it meets your requirements.
Answer:  It does not matter, as long as the software can meet the requirements of the RFQ, and require NO additional annual charge for updating customized features.

2) 	Are there a set of functional and technical requirements (beyond what is provided) that you have developed already?  Will these be made available for us to respond to?  
Answer:  Nothing more that what is described in the RFQ.

3)	Do you wish the vendor to do any preliminary analysis of your needs prior to responding with a formal bid?    Answer:  NO

4)	What more can I do to better understand your needs in order to ensure that we respond with a full service quotation that will met your needs?            Answer:  Nothing	

5) 	What is the schedule for us to effectively respond to this?   Answer:  It is hoped that Award can be made two weeks after receipt of proposals.  The schedule shall begin on the date of Award.

6)	Can I speak to you by phone to address my questions?    
ANSWER:	No, it is preferred to have all questions submitted in writing.

7) 	Is there a date wherein we need to provide a "interested in responding" letter of intent? ANSWER: No 
-
8)	Item 3 – do you currently have the preventative maintenance requirements that you want entered, or would we as the contractor create these?  Answer:  We will establish and write the PM requirements, the contractors responsibility will be to input the data into the system.

9)	Item 4 – are the requestor’s part of the 10 user licenses or are they separate?  If separate, approximately how many requestors would submit requests at the same time?    Answer:   NO, the 10 user licenses would be concurrent users and have administrative rights, the service requestors would be limited to just requesting service.  There would probably be no more than 30 at any one time.(10% of the employees)

10)	Item 6 – how many fields need to be customized?  What is the level of customization is needed?
Answer:  Mostly all of them, that meaning the heading or label for the specific column of area of data.   i.e. if I wanted to add a vehicle VIN number and there was only a field for license number, I could either add a space for it or change the license number heading to VIN number.

11)	Item 13 – does the data you have include all current equipment, or must the equipment data be collected from the field by inspecting each piece of equipment?  How much data is there (history, personnel, procurement, etc) that needs to be input into the new CMMS program?  Is this data in paper or electronic format?    Answer:  The data will be collected by our personnel and put into a spreadsheet.  All of this data will need to be entered or imported into the CMMS by the contractor.
-
12)	Any requirements for the front-end of the software? browser-based or visual-basic/developer 2000 based?        Answer:   Browser based.

13)	Does it need to be accessed from remote locations?
Answer:  It will only need to be accessed from within our LAN, and no offsite access.

14)	Oracle 9i is must or can be done with MySQL (OPEN-SOURCE) or SQL 2000?
Answer:  Only Oracle 9i

15) 	All work needed to be done onsite or off-site?     Answer:  Onsite

16) 	If on-site then, will USDA provide work space?   Answer:  Yes	

17)	 Any requirements for Hardware?    Answer:  No

18)	 Does the new CMMS system needed to be integrated with any legacy system or is it build from scratch?   Answer:  We are starting from scratch. 

19) 	Can we give suggestions to build the software in PHP (WEB-BASED) and MySQL (Databse), They are both open-source technology and one of the best, fastest, reliable technology combination out there. That would reduce the cost of licensing.   Answer:  No, Oracle is the agency standard.

20)	(Item no 1a) Is the Oracle 9i database already owned by the USDA or does the contractor have to provide the database?    Answer:  we already own it

21)	(Item no 1b) Is the Operating System, NT Server v 4.0 already owned by the USDA or does the contractor have to provide the operating system.     Answer:  we already own it

22)	What Make and Model Server will CMMS run on and how many CPUs total are there it the server? 
Answer:  88626RX IBM X series 365 Rack Ready Server (2) Pentium Xeon 3.0GHz

23).	Are there multiple servers. If yes, how many total CPUs are there per server? Answer:  One server.

24)	Is there a preferred vendor... and this is just cost justification/verification (short timeline)?
Answer:  I assume you are talking about the server.  We are providing the server.  
-
25)	Will this be a clean installation of the CMMS product (i.e. data from spreadsheets or legacy systems will NOT be preloaded before the go-live date)?   
Answer:  We will collect all equipment and personnel data needed and enter it into spreadsheet format.  There is no legacy system.

26)	If data is to be preloaded, can they provide specs on that data?         Answer:  Data will be loaded into an Excel spreadsheet for importation into the CMMS.  Data for equipment like model #, warranty info, serial #, brand name, PM tasks, PM schedule, ECT… will be collected for input into the CMMS.

<DESC>QUESTIONS and ANSWERS

RFP No. W914NS-04-R-0158




1.  Section L.1.4 Executive Summary Matrix.  We understand that the Executive Summary Matrix is limited to 2 pages and is not counted against the volume I  page limit.  Is there page limit for the Executive Summary itself and is it counted against the volume page limit?

Response: There is no requirement for an Executive Summary per se (beyond the Executive Summary Matrix). Therefore should the bidder include an executive summary it will be counted against the page limit for the volume in which it is included.





2.  Past Performance Sections L.2.2.2 and L.2.2.3 appear to be asking for the same references.  Can we combine these two into one template that mirrors the template for Iraq experiences and reference (L.2.2.4)?

Response: No objection to combining reference sections.





3.  Can Contractor take over the existing office space for all three business centers?

Response:  The 3 existing business centers now are being funded by Army Civil Affairs units.  The business centers will make share the resources they have (office space, office equipment, internet access, etc.) with the Contractor. The Contractor will not be charged rent for sharing resources in any business center. There is no guarantee, however, that any business center will have the amount of space and equipment that the Contractor requires to fulfill its plans.  The Contractor will agree the details of a transition of authority for the business centers with Civil Affairs. There is no prohibition on the Contractor sharing authority with Civil Affairs under any mutually agreeable arrangement.




 
4.   Will any rent be charged? If so, how much?

Response:  See answer to no. 3 above




 
5.  Can Contractor take over general office equipment (computers, copiers, etc.) in the centers for the duration of this contract? 

Response:  See answer to no. 3 above





6.  References to SF 1449 should read SF 33.  Please complete Blocks 13 through 18 on SF 33, and submit the SF 33 with your proposal.
