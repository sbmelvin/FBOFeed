<DESC>The 78th Services division's goal is to enhance readiness and morale of our troops by providing well-managed quality of life programs to the Robins Air Force Base community.  This is no small feat and it takes a lot of hard work, dedication and community support to make it happen.  That's why we seek to build strong partnership with the community around us.  In the past year, many companies have joined us in our mission by providing contributions of funds and products to make our events a success.  

	One such event is our ?Robins Bowling Festival.?  A week long festival of bowling events including a Commander's Bowling Tournament and the annual King and Queen Tournament. We are anticipating participation of approximately 800-1000 military personnel, family members and civilians of all ages.  It's going to be great fun for the whole family but we need your help.  We are seeking sponsorship in the form of cash or in-kind product to offset the budget for this event. In return we are willing to help market you area and inform the 20,000 members of Robins AFB community about the great things you have to offer in Savannah.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  I hope to hear from you soon.  

Sincerely,
Laticia R. Little

<CONTACT>JoAnna Black, Sr. Contracts Specialist, Phone 631-344-3960, Fax 631-344-5499, Email jblack@bnl.gov
<DESC>The Brookhaven National Laboratory, (herein known as "Brookhaven")  operated by Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC, (BSA) under Contract DE-AC02-98CH-10886, with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the operation of Brookhaven National Laboratory, herewith solicits your proposal to provide  1 complete Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) Collector Power Supply as delineated below:

An Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) is being constructed to provide the accelerator complex at Brookhaven National Laboratory with a wide range of ions.  Central to this system, is the electron device itself.  As a circuit element, it is similar to a high power vacuum tube in that there is a cathode that produces an electron beam, control elements, and a collector for the electron beam.  The system described in this document is the power supply for the EBIS collector.   
It is Brookhaven's intent to make one contract award.   
Scope of Work: The Offeror shall design, fabricate, assemble, test, and deliver 1 complete EBIS Collector Power Supply in strict accordance with BSA Specifications No. C-AD 1190 dated April 16, 2007 and BSA Statement if Work No. 15100200 SOW-01 Rev. B, dated June 4, 2007.  The EBIS Collector Power Supply shall contain all the hardware and equipment necessary to meet the performance criteria stated therein. 

A complete written proposal must be received by Brookhaven at the address below no later than 5:00 pm local time on July 13, 2007.  Any offer received after this time and date will not be considered unless in conformance with FAR Clause 52.215-10.  Proposals will be opened in private.

To ensure responsiveness and to preserve the integrity of the offeror's submission, five (5) copies of the Technical Proposal and two (2) copies of the Business and Price Proposal are to be submitted.  The technical and pricing proposals shall be submitted as separate volumes.  The proposal, and all supporting documentation which the offeror believes will fully describe the proposed capability, should be submitted sealed and the contents clearly identified.  The outside of each package must be marked with Brookhaven RFP Number 119475 and addressed as follows:
Attention: Ms. JoAnna Black, Procurement Supervisor, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Building 355, P.O. Box 5000, Upton, New York  11973-5000.

EVALUATION METHODOLOGY & CRITERIA:  It is the practice of Brookhaven, in making an overall evaluation of proposals received for negotiated procurements, to establish a Proposal Evaluation Panel (PEP) that will evaluate the proposals with respect to pre-established factors.  The following factors, listed in order of their weighted importance, have been identified as significant measures of equipment performance and the offeror?s capabilities. 

	1. Technical Proposal
	2. Past Experience/References
	3. Quality Assurance
	4. Delivery Schedule

Price will be evaluated but not point-scored.  Price will be part of the overall integrated evaluation.  The pricing proposal will be evaluated with respect to reasonableness in relation to the Statement of Work and the Specifications.  Price may assume more importance if two or more proposals are considered technically equal.  

All interested and capable offerors are encouraged to submit their requests in writing for a complete copy of the RFP, inclusive of the terms and conditions, aforementioned Statement of Work and Technical Specifications to JoAnna Black, Procurement Supervisor, at jblack@bnl.gov.

NGA intends to award a competitive unrestricted Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract to a contractor/contractor team with the proven ability to plan, integrate, organize, synchronize and execute a complex sustained, classified move of equipment, materials and 8,500 personnel from six geographically dispersed locations as directed by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Act and several non-BRAC locations in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area to a single new campus located in Springfield VA.
The successful contractor must demonstrate the ability to plan and execute the simultaneous relocation of agency missions, resources, and personnel. The Government anticipates that the majority of this effort may be performed under NAICS code 541614, Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services. All documents applicable to this pre-solicitation notice will be available via the Internet at www.fedteds.gov . 

Interested parties are invited to respond to this Presolicitation Notice, which is issued following the procedures described under FAR 15.202 entitled "Advisory multi-step process". The result of this pre-solicitation notice will help determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exist. Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This is a pre-solicitation for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the NGA. NGA will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this request for capabilities statements.

Please ensure the Request for Capability Statement (RFC) number AC-NCE-02 and program title (NGA NDPE) is referenced on all correspondence.   Telephone requests for this Presolicitation Notice will not be honored and no prospective Offerors list shall be maintained.    

ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS:  This advisory multi-step process is divided into two (2) steps. Step 1 consists of the submission of the Contractor Capability Statement, agency evaluation of the capability statement, and subsequent advisory notification to contractors of their likelihood of being a viable competitor. Step 2 consists of the solicitation, conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This Step will be initiated by issuing a formal RFP in the near future.  
Due to the short timeline associated with the NCE schedule and the classification of geospatial intelligence data sources, systems and methodologies, prospective contractors must presently possess adequate cleared facilities, IAS systems, and personnel capable of handling and processing TS/SI/TK data.

STEP 1:     SUBMISSION OF CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY STATEMENT, GOVERNMENT EVALUATION AND ADVISORY NOTIFICATION: This step includes submission of the Contractor Capability Statement followed by Government evaluation and advisory notification.  The program Draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is attached for the purpose of providing background information required to participate in this acquisition.  Please note the SOO is a draft and may be changed substantially.  Please note that no questions will be accepted during Step 1. The capability statement Evaluation Criteria are included in this announcement.

A. Submission of Contractor Capability Statement: Interested contractors are invited to submit a Capability Statement describing the information requested in the Contractor Capability Statement Instructions below. Contractor Capability Statements must be submitted electronically to Paula.J.Ireland@nga.mil and Joyce.M.Jennings@nga.mil  no later than 2:00 PM, EDST July 20, 2007. Responding to this requirement will require a significant effort on the part of the contractor to propose to the Government. It will also require a substantial effort on the part of the Government's evaluation team to evaluate an array of different approaches or solutions. It is the Government?s intent through the use of the advisory multi-step process to limit the number of contractors that will go through the time, expense, and effort of developing proposals to those that are deemed most qualified. Contractors contemplating competing for this contract award are asked to carefully review the attached Draft SOO and the Capability Statement Evaluation Criteria contained in this announcement to make a realistic self-assessment as to whether your organization has the experience and capacity to compete. 

B. Government Evaluations: The Contractor Capability Statement will be evaluated based upon the areas and criteria identified in the Contractor Capability Statement Instructions and Evaluation Criteria section. The Government will complete the Step 1 advisory multi-step process without communicating with the contractors who provide submissions.

C.  Advisory Notifications: NGA will issue an advisory notification stating that the respondent, based on the information submitted, is likely or unlikely to be a viable competitor. NGA will advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion.  Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, all respondants may participate in the resultant acquisition.

<DESC>The government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type purchase order for material in accordance with FAR part 13.5 (Clinger-Cohen), for Explosive Ordinance Disposal Mobile Unit Eight (EODMU8) in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The material is required for EODMU8 to provide for the safety of the forward deployed units of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Thermo?s Identifinder is a lightweight hand held device used to identify isotopes when radiation is present or suspected.  It captures a spectrum which is immediately compared to its internal library of isotopes for instantaneous computer interpretation of the isotopes present.  The spectrum is then downloaded and transmitted to Subject Matter Experts (SME) at the Department of Energy (DOE) for further analysis.  This acquisition is in direct support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The Government?s minimum needs have been verified by Certifying technical and requirements personnel.  This requirement is for items solely manufactured by Thermo Scientific.  The IdentiFinder, p/n IDF-EODKIT, is a patented unit and therefore is only available through Thermo Scientific.  Thermo Scientific, 27 Forge Pky, Franklin, MA 02038, is also the only know source of supply for this unit.  Substitutes in brand name would not be feasible because this is a technical unit requiring extensive training in the operation and is already in use in the field by other EOD units.  
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519.  A complete RFQ package will be available on or about 9 JULY, 2007.

Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIR WD), China Lake, CA, 93555 anticipates issuing multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for a period of 5 years.  The scope of the contract includes fabrication, testing, and delivery of high density printed circuit boards (PCBs).  High density is defined as boards up to 30 layers with through, buried, and blind vias.  The fabrication of the PCBs includes populating the circuit boards with electronic components.  The electronic components may be government furnished material (GFM) to the contractor. The required testing and reporting of the fabricated PCBs and the component population will be provided by the contractor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ! The contractor shall be an ISO 9001 registered company, and meet the manufacturing procedures that enable the PCBs to meet the rigorous environmental requirements specified in the statement of work.  The contractor shall have the engineering staff and software necessary to perform full design rule check (DRC) and design for manufacturing (DFM) on Gerber files provided by the government and shall notify NAVAIR WD design engineers of errors and/or anomalies in the Gerber files. The contractor shall work closely with NAVAIR WD design engineers and recommend changes to the Gerber files that fixes the errors, anomalies, and/or increases the yield of the PCBs.  All changes will be approved by NAVAIR WD engineers before fabrication of the PCBs begins.  The contractor will evaluate the impedance of the designed traces, and alert NAVAIR WD if there is difference from the specified impedance.  The contractor will test the impedance of the specified traces post fabrication and in circu!  it.  The contractor shall have the ability to fabricate high density PCBs up to 30 layers with through, buried, and blind vias.  The contractor shall use a process to inspect the circuitry and vias to ensure finished PCB electrical conformity to the Gerber file.  The contractor shall have the ability to maintain a PCB thickness tolerance of no greater than  +/- 10% of the specified nominal board thicknesss of a given design.  For board thicknesses thinner than 0.016", the board tolerance can have a minimum tolerance of +.003"/-.002". The board outline cutout tolerance shall be no more than +/-0.005". The contractor shall use processes that ensure that there is uniformity across PCB panels for both prototype and production PCBs, and provide one or more test coupons on every manufacturing panel.  The test coupons shall be thermally stressed, micro-sectioned, impedance tested, and examined for PCB conformity to the Gerber file.  When applicapable or specified, the contractor s!  hall use numerically controlled (NC) laser drilling with optical acqui sition to ensure that 4 mil minimum diameter holes can be drilled with a 1 mil tolerance.  The contractor shall use a process to test continuity and isolation of board layers, traces, circuitry, and vias.  All test documentation shall be delivered with each PCB.  The test documentation shall be associated with the appropriate PCB by the use of a serial number.   The contractor shall have the capability of populating the PCBs with electronic components, supplied as GFM from the government.  The contractor and all of the contractor's ancillary support service providers shall work directly with NAVAIR WD to resolve any technical issues. The contractor shall be able to solder with the optimal process for through hole, surface mount, ball grid arrays (BGA), FineLine BGA, leadless, and custom packaged components.  A dense FineLine BGA will have over 1000 contacts with a ball pitch of 1mm.  All of the listed components will be soldered without bridging , gaps, or disconnects.  The contractor shall also inspect the solder joints after populating the PCBs to ensure that no solder bridging and/or gaps have occurred.  The inspection shall use an automated optical inspection, manual inspection, or any other optimum inspection process.  Each BGAs and FineLine BGA shall have an XRAY taken post installation. A copy of each XRAY shall be delivered !  to the NAVAIR WD with the associated board.  Each XRAY will be documented with the associated PCB serial number and with the reference designator of the inspected BGA or FineLine BGA. Each board delivered shall be accompanied with documentation of both the electrical and mechanical sufficiency of the unpopulated board.  Final board operability is the responsibility of the government. To maintain the schedule requirements for this project, the manufacturer must be located within 200 miles of China Lake, CA to allow NAVAIR WD engineers to inspect the PCBs, both without and without electronic components, at the manufacturer's facility. The minimum number of PCBs to be procured is 2 with a unit issue of "each" per ID/IQ contract.  For any orders in excess of the minimum quantity, each ID/IQ contractor will be given a fair opportunity to be considered.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Fracture Machanics Finite Element Analysis (FEA) Tool Development NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Quest Reliability, Boulder, CO (formally Structural Reliability) for the following reasons: 1.	Quest Reliability is the sole developer of the FEA-Crack software program that forms the base infrastructure for this effort.	The Government currently utilizes this software platform for fracture mechanics analysis supporting the flight safety of structures.  It is a unique tool that is proprietary to Quest Reliability and that does not exist elsewhere in the marketplace.  The procured software development activity builds directly on this existing architecture, therefore Quest Reliability is the only company capable of adding these new capabilities to this code. 2.   Development of the required capabilities by someone other than Quest Reliability would require additional time and expense because they could not build on the existing FEA-Crack architecture.  To achieve the required analysis product, any company other than Quest Reliability will have to invest heavily in fundamental data handling capabilities for the WARP3D and ABAQUS software analysis packages, which is a duplication of effort already accomplished by Quest Reliability. 3.  Development of these analysis tools outside the FEA-Crack package would present compatibility issues and hinder efficient workflow within the Damage Tolerance Assessment Branch by requiring a recurring time investment to integrate two separate analysis packages. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 7/12/2007  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

SSA has a need for research and dissemination of information on international social security programs. Experience and developments in social security programs maintained by other nations are analyzed by SSA and related to SSA program and policy deliberations. This material is necessary input into SSA totalization agreement negotiation with foreign nations.   Executives within SSA use this information, as do other executive agencies, the Congress, researchers and the public. This activity generates the standard reference document, Social Security Programs Throughout the World (SSPTW) and updating Social Security Worldwide (SSW) is an internationally respected publication which has been produced by the Social Security Administration since 1937. A continuous flow of accurate and reliable data on international programs is critical to this program effort.  This requirement calls for the contractor to collect information on social security programs in approximately 172 countries, analyze the data, and produce four separate volumes of SSPTW and updating the most recent SSW include providing searchable, linkable electronic versions of available social security laws; information on recent developments in social security; and the full text of  SSPTW.  The contractor will be required to obtain and provide translations and any other support services necessary to the successful conduct and completion of the project. The ISSA possesses unique qualifications and capabilities in the social security field to meet the project requirements and successfully carry out its objectives.  For the past 2 decades the ISSA has collected information on social security developments and trends worldwide.  The ISSA regularly produces a number of social security publications on related topics.  The ISSA specializes in social security and has unique and long-established contacts. The ISSA?s affiliate members in 139 countries, as well as associate members in 40 countries with whom it has established working relationships, support the Association?s aims: the protection, promotion, and development of social security throughout the world.  In addition, the ISSA has contacts with about 47 non-member countries for the purpose of obtaining social security program information.  Furthermore, the ISSA, which had been in operation since 1927, provides a symposium for the international exchange of information in all areas of social security as broadly defined. The ISSA is a nonpolitical international organization. U.S. agency conduct of this project would preclude access to otherwise obtainable information from certain countries.  The ISSA has the capability and support services such as expert staff, physical facilities and translation capabilities, as well as social security contacts mentioned above, to ensure the systematic and consistent flow of materials required to effectively conduct this project.  The proposed contract is a fixed-priced term contract, with options for additional services.  Any organization that believes that it has the capability to perform this work may submit a statement of such capability.  This is not a request for proposal.  The cost for the preparation and submission of proposals will not be reimbursed by the Government. Responses to this notice should be submitted by July 11, 2007, 3:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time. Respondents will not be notified of the results of an evaluation of the information received.

Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition:

1.	Statutory authority: Statute: 13.106-1(b)

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

Benefit:  

The purchase of an upgraded instrument, M1MR M-Series Analyzer, will allow the NCI to continue screening efforts to discover novel inhibitors of Tdp1 and HIV-1 integrase. Several small molecule chemical libraries are currently waiting to be screened.   The acquisition of this instrument will promote translational development of novel anticancer and antiviral agents at NCI.



2.	Justification:
The NCI currently owns a M8 M-Series Analyzer from BioVeris that will be traded in for an advanced instrument, M1MR Analyzer.  BioVeris develops biological detection systems based on its proprietary electrochemiluminescent technology (BioVeris (BV) detection technology), which provides a unique combination of sensitivity, reliability, speed, and flexibility.  The M1MR Analyzer uses the BV? technology and provides a novel platform for biological measurements.  Additionally, BioVeris has developed an assay specific for measuring inhibition of HIV-1 integrase using this method.  This is the only known commercially available instrument supporting a medium- or high-throughput integrase assay utilizing the patented BVTM Technology.
BioVeris incorporates its BV detection technology into its instrument systems, tests and reagents, which are the biological and chemical components used to perform such tests.  

BioVeris Corporation's worldwide patent portfolio broadly covers the use of BV technology in diagnostic and other biological applications and includes a number of issued patents covering electrochemiluminescent compounds.  This includes BV-TAG detection reagents, compositions containing such compounds, the methods of making and using these compounds; and, BV detection technology systems adapted to detect and measure the compounds. 

The NCI requires the components of this instrument to be compatible with the BV detection technology. The Analyzer will include a touch screen laptop computer with research software installed running on Windows operating system. This software shall provide a wide dynamic range of detection, up to 5 logs of electrochemiluminescence signal. It will allow the use of user-defined protocols and will perform all quality control tests. It will track the reagent use through sensors and store all results with a security encryption feature. The system will have the ability to dispense reagents into sample wells of a 96-well plate. It will have the ability to interface with a robotic system and will offer an integrated plate shaking system. The analyzer will have a built-in barcode reader and will allow the sample results plus barcode information to be exported in standard ASCII format for an easy importation into other external programs for data analysis and manipulation. In addition, the system will have to be usable in open transport case for increased mobility.




This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Global Systems Positioning Wing will post the final Request for Proposal number FA8807-06-R-0001 for the GPS IIIA Space Vehicle to the GPS Bidders Library ON OR BEFORE 13 JULY 2007.  The Navstar GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS IIIA will maintain constellation sustainment, provide existing capabilities, plus introduction of a new L1C civil signal, increased earth coverage M-code power for authorized military users, a graceful growth path to achieve full CDD threshold requirements, and continuing support for the NDS mission, to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.  GPS IIIA is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  The GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 that requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 42 USC 14712 and comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.  This acquisition effort executes these statutory mandates.

BIDDERS LIBRARY:  
The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-Block III at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access. 

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the GPS IIIA RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. 
OMBUDSMAN:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed prices type contract with Time and Material provisions for services (including labor) for the development of a threat evaluation software system to improve maritime domain awareness in a selected Area of Responsibility (AOR) as required by the Commander Navy Europe/Commander Sixth Fleet, Naples, Italy.  This is a 100% Small Business set aside under North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) 541511.

The means of achieving this goal under contract will be to apply a COMPUTER ASSISTED MARITIME THREAT EVALUATION SYSTEM software program, fully compatible and interfaced with maritime detection data inputted from deployed equipment, tools, instruments, or other data sources, and authorized to operate in a military or a coalition network environment (classified or non-classified). The contractor shall provide a computer based threat evaluation system together with any other complementary, associated, supporting or bundled programs that will analyze ocean going cargo vessels for security implications in support of comprehensive maritime domain awareness efforts. The system shall allow for utilization of business rules developed in collaboration with coalition/Alliance partners, be approved by the US Navy and access external data to allow accurate, in depth and reliable threat evaluation and analysis, realistic and practical recommendations for interdiction, boarding or other appropriate action. Features shall include: Automatic data stream to identify and geolocate vessels; allow specification of parameters controlling which vessels to evaluate i.e. (geographic bounds, flag state, vessel type or size etc.); allow for access to external data to discover vessel, crew, cargo and voyage data; allow user developed threat evaluation rules and scoring to be applied to data automatically; shall display an operational picture with indications of threat status for all vessels based on a logical combination of scores derived from the application of each threat evaluation rule; and allow drill-down to display logic behind the threat status for each vessel. EXAMINATION OF SOURCE SELECTION PLAN - The SSP will be available with the solicitation on or before 26 July 2007. Offerors are invited to examine the Navy Source Selection Plan (SSP), located at http://www.fedbizops.gov on or before 26 July 2007.  It is not unusual for an SSP to contain some matters not specifically described in the solicitation, and vice versa.  For instance, the SSP will often identify the evaluation weighting scheme in greater detail, and may include the forms used by the Technical Evaluation Board in reviewing proposals. Despite these variations, both documents are intended to operate in harmony.  If any Offeror discovers an actual conflict between the provisions of the SSP and the Solicitation, this matter must be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer before the proposal submission date.  Please keep in mind that a conflict involves provisions that are inconsistent or mutually exclusive, not merely containing more detailed or additional information.  In the event that the SSP and the solicitation are in direct conflict, the provisions of the solicitation will apply, except for those matters referenced in the SSP that may be mandated by law or regulation.  

N.B.: If the Offeror cannot access the SSP from the address provided above, immediately contact the Contracting Officer or the Governments designated representative identified in. The proposed request for proposals (RFP) N00189-07-R-0032 along with the SSP will be posted on or before 26 July 2007 with a response date of 30 days thereafter. Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.   Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that the prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make the offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), on behalf of the Department of Justice, is seeking sources for quarterly and annual generator maintenance service, generator load and switch testing, generator repair service and materials, propane and diesel tank rental, and propane and diesel tank refill service.  Based on the initial Sources Sought announcement several questions have been asked and are being responded to through this Amendment:

Questions:  "Is there an imcumbent for the referenced Generator Maintenance?  If there is no one contractor for all makes and models of the generators referenced in the Sources Sought Notice, how are they being maintained at this time?"

Response:  The current generator maintenance in the San Diego area is being handled by one company which provides preventive maintenance.  Corrective maintenance is handled on a T&M basis as needed.  The generators in Washington and Oregon are not currently under contract; however some of the generators are still under warranty.  If repairs are needed, they are handled on a T&M basis.

The response date for the Sources Sought remains at July 13, 2007.  Responses shall be sent to the following address:  Internal Revenue Service, Office of Information Technology, Attn: Cathy Mann (OS:A:P:I:A:B), 6009 Oxon Hill Road, 5th Floor Mail Room, Oxon Hill, Maryland, 20745.

<SUBJECT>A -- RAPID EYE PROGRAM INDUSTRY DAY
<SOLNBR>SN07-47
<RESPDATE>071807
<ARCHDATE>08022007
<CONTACT>Chris Glista, Contracting Officer, Phone N/A, Fax N/A, Email christopher.glista@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Rapid Eye program is an exploratory development program with the overall goal of developing and demonstrating the ability to deliver a persistent ISR capability anywhere on the globe within one hour and remain on-station until relieved or the mission is completed.  It is envisioned that this program will, at a minimum, develop and demonstrate all the technologies necessary for the rocket delivery of a High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) UAV.  These technologies may include: low ballistic coefficient aerodynamic decelerators; low stored volume, deployable UAV structures; and high efficiency propulsion systems for vehicles operating at high altitudes.  Other advanced technologies may also be developed and demonstrated as required by the architectures proposed by Offerors.  The Government is not interested in approachs that employs any form of buoyant flight for this application. 

The Rapid Eye program will research and develop technologies and systems which will enable the military to: (i) rocket deliver a HALE UAV on a ballistic track to the approximate area of interest (ii) decelerate the launch package from reentry speeds to the UAV deployment speed, (iii) deploy the UAV and start its propulsion system, and (iv) provide persistent ISR on-station at high altitudes for a minimum of seven hours.  The air vehicle ISR payload is nominally 500 lbs with a 5kW power requirement.  It is envisioned that this proposed system will utilize a current inventory launch vehicle or one planned to be in the inventory by the end of 2009.  Launch vehicle should not require significant modifications (minor modifications, common to other launches, such as changes to fairing configuration, are permissible).

The key system development objectives include: (i) identification of robust system architectures that meet the program goals at a reasonable cost, (ii) identification of system designs that prove feasibility of the program vision through experimental demonstration and analysis, and (iii) identification and reduction of system and subsystem technology risks.

It is anticipated that the program will be divided into four phases: Phase 1) concurrent, high risk technology evaluation and conceptual system definition studies, concluding with a System Requirements Review and the accompanying Conceptual Design Review; Phase 2) risk reduction and mitigation test phase to include scaled demonstrations of critical subsystems and a Preliminary Design Review of the system; Phase 3) Critical Design Review of the system; Phase 4)  fabrication, assembly, systems integration, and flight test evaluation of the complete demonstration system.

The Rapid Eye program Industry Day will be held on July 25, 2007.  The goals of this meeting are threefold: (i) to familiarize participants with DARPA's interest in the Rapid Eye concept and component technologies, (ii) to identify potential Offerors and promote understanding of the BAA proposal requirements, and (iii) to promote discussion of synergistic capabilities among potential program participants.  It is our desire to facilitate the formation of strong teams and business relationships in order to develop comprehensive, quality responses to any potential DARPA solicitation.

The Industry Day will be held at Booz Allen Hamilton - Virginia Square, Suite 600
3811 N. Fairfax Dr., Arlington, VA 22203-1707 (http://www.boozallen.com).  

Pre-registration is required NO LATER THAN 3:00 PM EDT on July 18, 2007 for attendance.  The Industry Day will be unclassified and is limited to three representatives per organization.

<SUBJECT>Joint Precision Azimuth Sensing Conference Call for Abstracts
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has identified highly accurate but human-portable azimuth sensing as critical to the advancement of targeting and engagement capabilities.  Precise location and designation of targets, coupled with precise aiming of weaponry, are crucial for success not only in conventional warfare but in asymmetric and urban conflict, particularly as light-armored and dismounted tactics are required.  The key technology for achieving this precision is accurate azimuth and vertical angle sensing by the dismounted spotter and gunner operating under adverse conditions. In order to move forward in the development of this technology, DoD program/project management centers are coordinating their various efforts in order to seek a common solution for a human-portable azimuth and vertical angle measurement (AVAM) device.   This announcement is a call for abstracts from the inertial sensing industry, academia, laboratories, and relevant developers that wish to make known to the DoD their ideas, concepts, technologies, experiences, and recommendations toward realization of a human-portable AVAM device.  Each abstract submitted in response to this request will be for official use only (FOUO) and will not be shared among other submitters. Submitted abstracts shall not contain classified material.  Arrangements can be made for classified material upon request.  Furthermore, an abstract submitted in response to this call shall not be construed as a proposal for future developmental work, but only as a communication of information to the DoD. Based on the contents of the abstracts, submitters may be selected to individually and privately present to a DoD-only audience of program/project managers and engineers at the 2007 Joint Precision Azimuth Sensing Conference (JPASC).  Other JPASC presenters/participants will be excluded from the individual presentations in order to maintain a level of confidentiality with respect to the potentially proprietary information of the presenter.  Again, presentations shall not contain classified material. ABSTRACTS Submitted abstracts are at liberty to discuss some or all of the following issues related to human-portable AVAM technology: -     technology solution(s), current and potential -     accuracy considerations relevant for targeting and weapon aiming -     setup/alignment time -     suitability for difficult military environments including dismounted operations and weapon mounting -  	for applications in both GPS allowed and GPS denied environments -     weight/size/power considerations -     unit production cost considerations Of particular interest are novel and innovative approaches toward improving the current state-of-the-art.  However, the contents of abstracts should correspond with what the submitters would present at the 2007 JPASC if selected.  For purposes of guiding and focusing discussion, a preliminary list of desirable AVAM performance characteristics or goals follows: Near Term Performance Goals Key Parameter				 Azimuth Accuracy		plus or minus 4 mils PE (see note below)		 Vertical Angle Accuracy	plus or minus 2 mils PE (see note below) Orientation Angle		Pitch:  plus or minus 500 mils (approx. 30 deg) Bank:  plus or minus 270 mils (approx. 15 deg) Slew Rate			30 degrees per second	 Set up Time			less than 180 seconds		 Operational Temperature	minus 40C to plus 70C		 Shock				40g per 11 ms		 Vibration			MILSTD 810 min integrity Volume			less than or equal to 50 cu in		 Weight				less than or equal to 4.0 lbs	 Power				less than or equal to 10 W	 Average Unit	Production	TBD	   Cost  at FY07 dollars		 Long Term Performance Goals Key Parameter		 Azimuth Accuracy		plus or minus 1 mil PE (see note below) Vertical Angle Accuracy	plus or minus 1 mil PE (see note below) Orientation Angle		Pitch:  plus or minus 1511 mils (approx. 85 deg) Bank:  plus or minus 500 mils (approx. 30 deg) Slew Rate			1000 degrees per second Set up Time			less than 1 second Operational Temperature	minus 40C to plus 70C Shock				2000g per 1.5 ms at weapon fire Vibration			MILSTD 810 min integrity Volume			lest than or equal to 0.25 cu in Weight				less than or equal to 0.2 lbs Power				less than or equal to 250 mW Average Unit	Production	TBD   Cost  at FY07 dollars	 Note:  PE is defined as the magnitude of a deviation from a statistic that will be exceeded with probability of 0.50, or on half the occasions. For a normal distribution it is 0.6745 times the standard deviation.  Azimuth capability must be achievable between 60 deg N/S Lat. Abstract submissions should be limited to one page in Microsoft Word format.  A single-page cover letter should accompany the abstract.  Submissions must be unclassified.  Submissions will not be shared among the other submitters/participants. The abstract and cover letter should be submitted both electronically as an email attachment and in hard copy form to: Ms. Karin Chandler Coordinator, JPASC 2007 Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC Crane) Code 6062 Bldg. 3395 300 Highway 361 Crane, IN 47522-5001 Email: karin.chandler@navy.mil Electronic submissions of abstracts are due by 20 July 2007.  Submitters will be sent email confirmation of receipt of their submittals.  Submitters selected for presentation at the 2007 JPASC will be subsequently notified. CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS If selected, presenters should describe their potential, recent, or ongoing developmental efforts in the area of human-portable AVAM, consistent with their abstracts.  Presentation of late breaking results and work in progress is especially encouraged.  Presentations will be limited to 30 minutes plus 15 minutes for questions.  There may also be an opportunity for breakout sessions where presenters may be invited for in-depth discussions on their topic at the request of one or more of the government participants.

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE NOTICE: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  A copy of the requested items list will be given upon vendor request.

A determination not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon this vendor being the only manufacturer/vendor able to satisfy this requirement: Sole Source is also based upon the authority FAR 6.302-1(2)(C)(ii) which allows for sole source purchase if it is considered a follow-on contract for the continued development of a system when the award would result in duplication of cost.  The circumstances that justify the restrictions to a DataPath, Inc. acquisition are that DataPath is the only company that provides the winterization equipment that is compatible with the Traffic Terminals and SIPRNet Point of Presence (SPOP) Antennas currently deployed throughout the Combined Joint Operations Area-Afghanistan (CJOA-A).  This purchase will be used to support the CJTF-82 Traffic Terminals and SPOP systems located at Forward Operating Bases (FOB) and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) throughout the CJOA-A.  These systems establish the critical communications link for NIPR, SIPR and CENTRIXS connectivity to the warfighter.  Only DataPath, Inc. can provide the form-fitting equipment and heater packages necessary to protect these critical systems from the harsh winter months.  The antenna snow shields and heater packages are 100% compatible with the current systems deployed throughout the theater.  Without this winterization equipment, CJTF-82 will be unable to sustain reliable communications during the winter months to sites relying solely on Traffic Terminal and SPOP equipment to transmit and receive mission-critical data.

The contractor will be responsible for visiting the site and verifying the length of pipe, other materials needed, and the appropriate way to tie into the tank and boiler piping ends.  Attached is a proposed route of installation, in which all but approximately 42 feet are above ground.  This section will be installed below the driveway.  Some vehicles will still have to travel through this area, so appropriate covering and safety cones will have to be provided until complete.  The trenched area must be restored as before trenching.  Above ground pipe will be schedule 40 carbon steel pipe and below ground will be an approved double wall pipe (either hard pipe or flexible).   Any welding must be done by a certified welder.  The piping on the exterior wall of the Kennel will be enclosed in metal that resembles existing downspouts on the building and approved by ATF.  Along with the proposal, the contractor will list the materials and include a description of the installation.   All materials must be approved by ATF.

Buried piping and fittings shall be hydrostatically tested prior to being covered over and a written test report  provided to ATF attesting the piping system has no leaks.
The contractor will be responsible for determining if the existing jockey pump is adequate to draw fuel from the tank to the boilers.  In the proposal, the contractor should provide the quote using 1" piping.  A pressure test will be required.

Running circuits from the mechanical room for the heat tape should be included.  The piping going across the roof will be laid on the roof according to the roof manufacturer's recommendations and the ATF will be responsible for the roof penetrations.  

The contractor shall also extend the floor drain, in between the boilers, upward to prevent fuel oil from getting in the drain.   The copper tubing from the boilers going to the drain will have to be modified to account for the extension so they will still drain.


The contractor will be responsible for removing all trash and excess oil from the site.

The Background Investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the Personnel Security Branch, Office of Professional Responsibility and Security Operations, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). It is the responsibility of the Contractor employee to provide the necessary security package in a timely manner, through the assigned Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR), to ATF's Personnel Security Branch so that a Background Investigation can be conducted.  

The Contractor shall screen and review each potential Contractor employee and ensure that each potential Contractor employee to be assigned to this contract possess a personal history that is in compliance with DOJ and ATF personnel security guidelines and will permit each employee to successfully pass a Background Investigation conducted by the ATF.  Prior to requesting the potential contractor employee to complete necessary security package, the Contractor shall screen the following aspects of each potential contractor employee's personal history:

During the Contractor's review of each potential Contractor employee's personal history, the contractor is required to review each potential Contractor employee's personal security package to ensure the forms are fully complete, signed, and dated.

The Contractor is hereby advised that a Background Investigation may take ninety (90) days or more to complete, depending on the complexity of the investigation.  The contractor is encouraged to fill all positions with employees who have recently been the subject of a Limited Background Investigation (LBI), Background Investigation (BI), or Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and/or who possess a Top-Secret clearance, or a Secret clearance based on a LBI or BI.  The Contractor shall submit documentation proving such Investigation was conducted or clearance granted with the Contractor employee's complete security package.   

In those instances where the Contractor believes that it (or any of  contractor's employees) will not need unescorted access to any ATF facilities, or access to any ATF proprietary information, data or automated information systems, the Contractor shall notify the COTR.  The COTR will then apprise ATF?s Personnel Security Branch of the Contractor?s initial determination, citing the reasons therefore.  The Personnel Security Branch, in consultation with the COTR or Bureau Contracting Officer, will make the final determination as to whether or not the contractor employee will need to undergo a Background Investigation.  The nature and specific degree of Background Investigations will be determined by the Personnel Security Branch, depending upon the nature and degree of risk associated with the contract position.

At the conclusion of the Background Investigation, the Personnel Security Branch will annotate ATF Form 8620.5, either granting or denying access, and return a copy of the form to the COTR.  The COTR is then responsible for advising the Contractor of ATF?s determination.  In those instances where access is granted, the COTR will be responsible for securing from the Contractor employee an executed ATF Form 8800.2, Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement for Contractors.  Access to ATF facilities, proprietary information, data, or automated information systems is not authorized until such time as an executed ATF Form 8800.2 is delivered to the Personnel Security Branch, Room 2474, 650 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20226, unless initially submitted with the security package.

Contractor employees are not authorized to access ATF facilities, proprietary information, or data, including ATF?s automated information systems, until such time as they have been favorably adjudicated by the Personnel Security Branch in accordance with the adjudicative guidelines as directed by the Department of Justice.

This requirement can be waived for short-term (i.e., those employees performing duties for a cumulative total of fourteen (14) days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized or unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages).  These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens.  A waiver request from the head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite contractor clearance package shall be submitted through the COTR to the Department Security Officer (DSO) for approval.  Each waiver request will be reviewed by the DSO and a determination made on a case-by-case basis.

If the Contractor employee fails to provide mitigation within the allotted fifteen (15) days, the COTR, the Bureau?s Information Security Officer, and the Physical Security Programs Branch will be notified that the Contractor employee has been denied access and the matter will be closed.  In the event the Contractor employee provides sufficient mitigation to warrant reconsideration of the original determination, the COTR and the Bureau?s Information Security Officer will be notified via ATF Form 8620.5 that access has been granted to the Contractor employee.

Should a Contractor employee be found unsuitable, he or she may ask to review the investigative file by filing a request under the Freedom of Information Act with the Disclosure Division, Room 8400, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, 650 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20226.

This is a brand name only acquisition which is approved based upon the following excert from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and approval. 

The USSOCOM Enterprise Network Test and Evaluation Environment is a scaled replication of USSOCOMs real operational environment, and as such it must be a exact duplication of the real operational environment to maintain any value.  The role of this environment is to accurately represent the USSOCOM production environment on a smaller scale.  This environment is used to evaluate any risks new products or service might have on the production network and so must match exactly.  USSOCOM currently has over $1 Million in equipment in the Test and Evaluation Environment which matches the exact make and model of the equipment in the production network.  The requested Cisco hardware and software is a sample of the more the $50 Million in Cisco devices throughout the USSOCOM Network Enterprise.  Utilization of any non Cisco products would also be reguired to be incorporated into the operational environment, which can reasonably be assumed to cost 50 times more than the requested Cisco equipment (1/50 scale).  Without this brand name procurement any future products or service offerings on the Enterprise would put USSOCOM assets at substantial risk from network failure or compromise. 

Award will be made to the quotation which offers the best value to the government. Multiple awards may be accomplished if any items are determined to be unbalanced. The Government also reserves the right to make no award at all.

This acquisition is a brand name only requirement based upon the excerpt from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and Approval.

The USSOCOM Enterprise Network is entirely Cisco.  Introduction of additional vendors into the enterprise to rectify this requirement would require additional testing and interoperability evaluation, as well increase the total cost of ownership (TCO) through additional training, maintenance contracts and interoperability engineering.  Under the terms of the current support contract, the Government is responsible for providing EITC contractors with training on any equipment introduced to the network infrastructure outside that which was originally specified.  The cost of training alone would be $3,500 a week for a training class and travel, plus a contractor labor cost of $2,880 per week.  Training just 4 contractor for 4 weeks on any alternative equipment would cost the Government more then $100,000 in addition to the purchase price of the equipment.  Without this brand name procurement, there would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through full and open competition. 

Award will be made to the quotation which offers the best value to the government. Multiple awards may be accomplished if any items are determined to be unbalanced. The Government also reserves the right to make no award at all.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 17 July 2007, 10:00 A.M.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION NOTICE.   This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

The reference solicitation number is:   NHLBI-PB(HL)-2007-189/DDC.

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-15.   The total contracted dollar amount, including options, if any will not exceed $5 million.  

The acquisition is being conducted as a full and open competitive, with no set aside restrictions.  The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 423450  and the associated small business size standard is 100 employees. 
 
The Government?s anticipated delivery date is thirty (30) calendar days after the receipt of the purchase order.   

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Bethesda, Maryland.    

Market research conducted by the Government has determined that the Siemens Medical Systems? brand Echocardiography Ultrasound Systems are the only systems that are compatible with the NHLBI, Laboratory of Developmental Biology?s existing hardware and software. 

The Echocardiography Ultrasound Systems are required to continue the research studies in cardiovascular functions using echo cardiography of the Laboratory of Developmental Biology.   The existing echo cardiography ultrasound systems has served its usefulness capacity and the available equipment upgrades will significantly improve the imaging and measurement capabilities required of the research efforts.    The Laboratory of Developmental Biology  specifically requires equipment which will have the capability to obtain hemodynamic and structural measurements.  The measurements obtained by the ultrasound imaging will need to be merged with a large body of existing data.  For this reason, the functional parameters of the machine must precisely match those previously used to allow for the compilation of the old data with the new data to be obtained with the new machine.    In addition, the NHLBI has invested considerable information technology resources and several years time to develop custom methods to translate the machine code in the ACUSON Sequoia for direct offloading of the measurements and images into our server system. This is necessary to allow continuous compiling and tracking of the large body of measurements obtained from the ultrasound imaging.  Given this, the Government must purchase an ACUSON Sequoia to ensure the retention of this capability for efficient seamless continuation of our ongoing analysis of cardiovascular function using echocardiography.  It is the Government?s intent to trade-in existing echo cardiography ultrasound systems.  For these reasons only the Siemens Medical Systems Sequoia brand systems have the capability of satisfying the Government?s minimum requirements.

Based upon the above rationale the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA),  for the NHLBI, Laboratory of Developmental Biology, intend to award a single, fixed priced purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. 51 Valley Stream Parkway, Malvern, Pennsylvania 19355, for the purchase of three (3) each refurbished Echo Cardiography Ultrasound Systems.

The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor e mployees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC  to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast ac cess identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contra ctor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast ac cess identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer perform s work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall i mmediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visi tors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such cha nges shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identificati on badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the cir cumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contrac t.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contra ct for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act ( FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identific ation cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.- Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  -In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electr onic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.-  Quoters are required to submit completed  copies of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 and its ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their quotes.

<CONTACT>Bryan Moy Contract Specialist 2023146282     bryan.moy@ntsb.gov;
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 0001 to Request for Quote (RFQ) NTSB-Q-07-0048 is to post answers to questions submitted by prospective offerors.  The following questions and answers are posted for utilization by all interested parties.  Quotes are due no later than 4:00 p.m. EST on Wednesday, July 11, 2007 via email to Bryan Moy at bryan.moy@ntsb.gov. 1 - Regarding the initial quote to NTSB, do we reissue the same quote but with updated prices? There are a couple of items on the quote, which are not described in your solicitation. ANSWER - The offeror's initial estimate will not be a factor in award.  As stated in the combined synopsis/solicitation, selection and award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.  Technical acceptability will be determined by review of the information submitted by the offeror, in response to the combined synopsis/solicitation, which must provide a description in sufficient detail to show that the product offered meets the Government's requirement.  At a minimum, offerors are advised to submit a quote that addresses the entire requirement as stated in the combined synopsis/solicitation. 2 - After item 13, there is a note where the offeror must describe the usability & adaptability to meet Government's requirement. The initial quote was per NTSB request per my demo @ their location.  What kind of description is needed here? Or will the line item quote be sufficient? ANSWER - A line item quote is not sufficient.  The award decision is based on what an offeror provides in response to the combined synopsis/solicitation.  Any information outside of this will not be a factor in award.  Offeror's are advised to address in writing the government's entire requirement including the usability and adaptability of their proposed system as stated in the combined synopsis/solicitation. 3 - I tried researching the ORCA BPN website using our DUN # but was not able to access our info.  Our DUN # was not on record.  What website link should I try? ANSWER - The Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website can be found at the following address: https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx. 4 - This is new for me.  I'm concerned about leaving out any required info.  If something is missing, will there be time to correct any gaps? ANSWER - In accordance with FAR 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors-Competitive, which was included by reference in the combined synopsis/solicitation, the NTSB intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the offeror's initial quote should contain the offeror's best effort in terms of cost, price and a technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. 5 - What does 0x magnification mean? At what working distance?  ANSWER - Less than 1x -- infinite focus. 6 - Can you be more specific about the depth of field requirement?  This also seems to be in conflict with the 3-D requirement. Great depth of field means that there is very little depth information in the image unless it is garnered from stereo pairs. Is that your intent?  ANSWER - For normal (non 3-D) viewing, depth of field should be optimized for magnification without compromising resolution.  The method of achieving 3-D viewing is not specified other than it requiring limited operator intervention (ease of use).  7 - It is unclear how you wish to achieve the 0x to 200x magnification. Is this supposed to be done with a single lens? If not are the lighting adapters required for all supplied lenses?  ANSWER - Multiple zoom lens may be used, however, light adapters must fit all lens used for the range or be supplied for all lens. 8 - Rather than rotating the sample would a scheme that rotates the lens be acceptable as well?  ANSWER - No. 9 - Is the 3-D reconstruction required over the 0x to 200x magnification range?   ANSWER - No. 3-D reconstruction is required as much as possible in the 0x to 200x magnification range.

 Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Bismuth Germanate (BGO) Asymmetrical Compton Suppression Shield, which shall meet or exceed the following salient characteristics:

1)  The basic dimension of the BGO shall be 5 inches x 5 inches x 7.15 inches.  If not made from a single crystal, a maximum of two crystals shall be used and each piece shall be full length.
2)  The diameter of the cylindrical well in the BGO shall be 3.375 inches to accommodate a 3.25 inches diameter end-cap Ge detector.  The length of the cylindrical well, drilled at a right angle to the long axis of the BGO, shall be 4.0 inches. 
3)  The cylindrical window allowing the Ge detector to view the sample is drilled along the center axis of the BGO and at a right angle to the Ge detector well, shall be 0.875 inches in length with a 1.6 inches diameter.  This face may be beveled to enhance light collection.
4)  There shall be approximately 3 inches of BGO between the photomultiplier tube (PMT) and the Ge detector (behind the Ge detector). 
5)  The GBO shall be encased in light and moisture tight Al and have a reflective interior.
6)  One standard 5 inches PMT with magnetic shield, removable voltage divider, and preamplifier.  This system is used in a very high background area, with gamma rays ranging in energy from 100keV to 10.8 MeV.  A low background PM tube is not required but good stability with high count rates is needed.  PHR 20% or better for Cs-137.
7)  The BGO will be used with an up-looking germanium detector which detects gamma rays from a sample placed at a distance of 12 inches to 18 inches to the side of the detector, i.e., at 90 degrees with respect to the cylindrical axis of the germanium crystal.


All other terms and conditions remain the same.
