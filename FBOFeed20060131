<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that
reduce homeland vulnerabilities. HSARPA has a unique capability to perform these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities.

A critical area of focus for DHS is the protection of the homeland from the release of a biological agent. This focus is demonstrated by the BioWatch surveillance system and a
number of programs initiated by HSARPA that are developing new sensor technologies. These include the Bioagent Autonomous Networked Detectors (BAND) and Rapid Automated Biological Identification System (RABIS) programs under solicitation RA03-
01, as well as Instantaneous Bio-Aerosol Detector Systems (IBADS; BAA 04-18), Low-Cost Bio-Aerosol Detector Systems (LBADS; BAA 05-08), and Food Biological Agent Detection Sensors (FBADS; BAA 05-06) programs. As a complement to the technology
program initiated under RA03-01, HSARPA initiated the Bioinformatics and Assays Development program (BIAD; BAA 04-03) to extend the existing family of detection and forensics assays as well as to develop next generation assays and new tools for assay development. (See www.hsarpabaa.com for details about these past solicitations.) Development of new sensor systems is not a priority for the BIAD2 program.

<DESC>TSA intends to issue a sole source contract with the American Association of Airport Executives / Transportation Security Clearinghouse (AAAE/TSC) of Alexandria, VA to 
provide operational support in the collection and processing of fingerprints for the TSA Alien Flight Students Program (AFSP).   The efficient collection and processing of fingerprints is dependent upon an available, accredited and robust IT infrastructure. AAAE has built an extensive infrastructure as a result of providing the identical services to TSA for numerous other ongoing TSA security programs. AAAE custody of this unique infrastructure allows them to immediately leverage their national and international fingerprint infrastructure otherwise unavailable to other vendors. This infrastructure links to airports, flight training providers, and international fingerprint collection agents, in addition to having the only accredited system tied to the TSA store and forward system and the FBI fingerprint system. Although other sources may feasibly provide similar fingerprint collection services, no vendors currently provide the complete range of services and infrastructure beyond fingerprint collection.

Potentially Reduced Exposure Products (PREPs) are tobacco products that are purported to be less harmful.  The public health community, having experienced a similar situation with the introduction of ìlightî cigarettes, wants to respond quickly and appropriately to the introduction of this new class of cigarettes.  One great need in forming a quick and appropriate response is surveillance data and information about the publicís reaction to these new products.  The University of Massachusetts-Boston shall review and evaluate existing data sources for public health surveillance of risk perception and use related to PREPS, review existing survey instruments, and perform sequential rounds of cognitive tests on a set of core questions to cover the areas of surveillance and consumer perception and interest in PREPS.        

The Center for Survey Research at the University of Massachusetts-Boston has sponsored and co-chaired workshops addressing the need for surveillance activities related to introduction of potentially reduced exposure products and their potential impact on public health.  The Center for Survey Research is a complete survey research facility with the staff and resources to carry out all phases of the survey research process and the ability to provide technical expertise on study design and sampling, evaluation of survey questions, quality control in data collection, and analysis of data. The Center conducts basic and applied research that contributes to knowledge and understanding of important social issues, and supports regional public and private agencies in carrying out high-quality policy-research projects.  The Center also conducts research on and has expertise in quality assurance and survey processes. Thus, they are in a unique position to advise NCI on the quality of existing tobacco surveys and opportunities for developing new questions. The Center utilizes both personal and mainframe computers and a wide array of database management and statistical analysis software. The professional staff is experienced in producing reports of varied types, including press releases, executive summaries and major scholarly monographs. Moreover, the Center has unique experience related to the study of survey question evaluation and testing.   The Center for Survey Research at the University of Massachusetts-Boston is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned services.

<DESC>The Bacteriology and Mycology Branch (BMB), Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking contractors interested in advancing the field of contemporary clinical laboratory diagnostics for Invasive Aspergillosis (IA).  DMID intends to solicit this project under full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541710.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about May 4, 2007, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 6.75 total FTEs.  Diagnosis and treatment of serious fungal infections are high priorities of the NIAID.  Systemic fungal infections are a significant health problem in immunocompetent hosts (the endemic mycoses) and immunocompromised hosts (the opportunistic mycoses in addition to the endemic mycoses). The burden of invasive fungal disease in the U.S. has shifted from the community to the hospital base. These are recognized as important emerging infectious diseases, especially in nosocomial settings involving the management of bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipients, neutropenic cancer patients, and surgical, trauma and critical care patients.  Fungi cause approximately ten percent of nosocomial bloodstream infections.  This contract will link the appropriate clinical specimens (blood, urine, etc.) from subjects at risk for IA and potentially interfering medical conditions to currently available and experimental laboratory tests for the purposes of diagnostic proof of principle, test comparison, and evaluation of the effect of potentially interfering medical conditions (pathologies/interventions), unrelated to IA, on the performance of the diagnostic test.  It is expected that these goals be achieved through the establishment and maintenance of a repository of clinical samples from patients at risk for IA and by performing evaluation and comparison studies between FDA-cleared tests for IA and experimental IA diagnostic tests.   Offerors are required to demonstrate relevant experience in establishing and operating a clinical sample repository in accordance with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) guidelines, access to human subjects at high risk for developing Invasive Aspergillosis that must include subjects receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy and subjects at high risk for IA with potentially interfering medical conditions that must also include subjects receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy, personnel with experience in Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and collection of samples from human subjects, personnel with experience in Good Laboratory Practices and diagnostic test development, and adequate facilities.  It is expected that these goals be achieved through the establishment and maintenance of a repository of clinical samples from patients at risk for IA and by performing evaluation and comparison studies between FDA-licensed tests for IA and experimental IA diagnostic tests.  Offerors will be evaluated against the adequacy of their training, experience, expertise and availability of the proposed PI, including technical and management skills, knowledge of applicable regulations to manage a GCP and GLP compliant clinical sample repository and ability to direct GLP compliant test studies along with personnel that have appropriate GCP and GLP training.  Offerors should have access to patient populations at risk for Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) such that it is highly probable that serial clinical samples will be collected from a minimum of forty-five (45) subjects diagnosed with proven IA and a minimum of forty-five (45) subjects diagnosed with proven IA with potenitially interfering medical conditions during the first three years of the contract.  Offerors will be asked to provide a cost-effective plan for obtaining and storing samples from subjects at risk for developing IA and provide documented evidence of all collaborations/consortiums that will be formed to collect and/or store specimens.  Patient populations must include subjects receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy and may also include neutropenic cancer patients, and solid organ transplant recipients.  

Your proposal should address staff expertise in the collection of clinical research samples and medical information in a GCP compliant manner along with an understanding of the OHRP guidelines for the operation of a repository.  It is expected that offerors have experience in the storage, retrieval and distribution of samples and would be expected to provide personnel, facilities (clean rooms, laboratories, storage area, etc.), and equipment (freezers, refrigerators, etc.) available for preparing the samples and the repository, along with a system that will be used to track samples in the repository.  Offerors should have an understanding of Federal, State and international shipping regulations, validation testing for cold chain shipping containers, preparation of SOPs based on the results of validation testing, preparation of all shipping documents, preparation of SOPs for the receipt and proper storage of clinical  samples,  experience in the techniques used in published laboratory tests available to detect Aspergillus fumigatus, including PCR and other technologies that could potentially be used to develop IA diagnostic tests, expertise in performing and interpreting the results from the Bio-Rad PlateliaTM Aspergillus EIA test, and access to samples required for replication studies (IA animal model or samples from previous IA clinical studies).  This RFP will be available electronically on/about February 15, 2006, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps and the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.    All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.    No facsimile or e-mail transmissions will be accepted. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to the Regents of the University of California (M.I.N.D. Institute) for the requirement of the Autism Phenome Pilot Project under the NIMH Project entitled Clinical and Immunological Investigation of Regression in Autism.  The current investigation will focus on the interrelationship between regression in autism and immune dysfunction.  Specifically, the Regents of the University of California will recruit and initially evaluate 55 children.  Children of both sexes with autism spectrum disorder will be compared and contrasted with children with developmental delays but not autism.  

The University of California (M.I.N.D. Institute) maintains clinical and biomedical infrastructure to carry out many component processes of the Autism Phenome Pilot Project.  The University of California (M.I.N.D. Institute) has an affiliation with the CHARGE study which is already recruiting children with autism, children with developmental delays, and healthy children on a population-based sample.  The sample will allow initial pilot data in a short time frame.  

An award to any other source would affect the NIH prior and current research involving the recruitment and evaluation of very young child with autism and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.     

Period of Performance will be 12 months. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 and the Size Standard is $6.5 million. 

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.     Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.

<ARCHDATE>03152006
<CONTACT>Stacey Hughes, Contracting Officer, Phone (850)882-0190, Fax (850)882-4561, Email stacey.hughes@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) concerning potential fuzes for hard target applications. Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to perform studies and analyses on existing and future weapons capable of being deployed from current and future fighter and bombers to perform required missions against deeply buried targets.   THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.     

Air Armament Center, Capabilities Integration Directorate, Technology Transition and Concept Development Division (AAC/XRS), Eglin Air Force Base is working to develop a replacement hard target fuze for the FMU-143.  The FMU-143 was designed for limited hard target capabilities but has been used for greater depths of penetration with much heavier weapons with greater g-forces than it was designed for resulting in poor performance and questionable results.  
The Government is open to any and all technologies (mechanical, electro-mechanical, electronic safe and arm, etc) that may be available and viable to meet these requirements.  
1.	This fuze needs to be designed to survive BLU-113 penetration capabilities and impact velocities into earthen covered hard target structures of 10,000 psi concrete with or without burster slabs.
2.	Fuze must be compatible with current inventory hard target penetrator warheads to include BLU-109, BLU-113, BLU-116 and any special application penetrators as the BLU-121 and BLU-122.  
3.	Compatibility will include guidance assemblies as the JDAM GBU-31 family, all laser guidance kits as the GBU-24, 27, 28 and any future air to surface penetrators.  
a.	Fuze will be powered by air generator, FZU, and/or by weapon system power, if available, or any other alternate power approach as long as the requirements of Mil-Std-1316 are met.  FZU, if required, will be provided with each fuze.  Fuze will be designed for high altitude releases up to 60,000 ft or weapon envelope (whichever is more restrictive). 
4.	Fuze will be capable of being launched from the following aircraft platforms:
a.	F-15E, F-16, B-2, B-1B, B-52, F-35, F-117, F-22, and UAS.
b.	Fuze will be designed for 200 hours bomber and 100 hours fighter captive carriage life
c.	Release speeds are 200 to 750 KCAS or 1.8 M whichever is less.
5.	Fuze will be designed for up to 255 ft of depth of burial, 1st void sensing with timed delay detonation settings from instantaneous to 255ms in 1ms increments and will allow for longer delays from 4 minutes to 4 hours in 15 minute increments.  
6.	Fuze will be designed for impact velocities of up to 1400 fps with an angle-of-attack (AOA) of up to + 2 degrees.
7.	Fuze will allow for setting arm times from 4 to 30 seconds in 1 second increments.  
8.	Fuze will be capable of initiation of all current insensitive munitions (IM) explosives and be IM compliant.
9.	Fuze will meet MIL-STD-1316, MIL-STD-2105 and STANAG 4187 requirements.
10.	All settings will be programmed either through the cockpit or from the CMBRE or is manually settable on the fuze.
11.	Mission reliability for guided weapons with fuze will be 98%.
12.	Fuze will be designed to meet the USAF safety requirements and standards.
13.	Fuze service life will be 10 years or more; storage life of 20 years or more.
14.	The following additional requirements (future spirals) may be potentially added and should be considered in your response to this request for information:
a.	Void and /or layer sensing
b.	Survive High Speed / Hypersonic impact velocities (1500-2000 fps) and gís.
c.	Longer delays up to 24 hours
15.	The Government would like to be appraised if any of the above requirements are viewed as cost and/or schedule drivers. 
16.	The Government is also interested in potentially conducting some sled and vibration testing during the 3rd or 4th quarter of FY06.  The Government would like to know if hardware would be available for this effort.  This demo fuze does not have to meet all of the above requirements except for deeper, harder target penetration.

Respondents to this RFI are encouraged to provide relevant examples of ongoing and previous contractual efforts with the Government that support the desired capabilities described. Respondents may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. Respondents are encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately. AAC/XR uses manpower technical support contractors in fulfilling its mission requirements to include review of these capabilities submittals.  These contracts contain an organizational conflict of interest clause that requires the service contractors to protect the data and prohibits the contractors from using the data for any purpose other than that for which the data was presented. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, as well as subject to modification, and is in no way binding on the Government. Responses should reference Deeply Buried Hard Target Fuze, not to exceed 15 pages in length to include cover page, appendices, tables and figures, and should be mailed to the Air Armament Center, Capabilities Integration Directorate, Technology Transition and Concept Development Division (AAC/XRS), Bldg 349, 207 West D Ave., Suite 308, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542-6844, ATTN: Sonny Childress; delivery of electronic copies is acceptable, if under 5MB to sonny.childress@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>By way of this Notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.203-1, The Chicago District U. S. Army Corps of Engineers announces its intentions to award a Sole Source, Firm Fixed-Price contract for Technical Consulting Services for Electrical Safety Analysis to Underwriters Laboratories (UL) of 1285 Walt Whitman Road, Melville, NY 11747-3081.  UL has extensive background and expertise in electrical safety testing and certification. They have tested products for public safety for more than a century and uphold the undisputed reputation as the leader in product-safety testing in the United States.  Dr. Walter Skuggevig, the proposed lead from UL on this initiative, has been with UL for over 40 years and is a subject matter expert in the field of electrical safety . Dr. J. Patrick Reilly, who would also be involved on this project, authored a book with contributions from Dr. Skuggevig titled Applied Bioelectricity: from Electrical Stimulation to Electropathology which discusses the human health effects resulting fro m electric stimulation including electrical principles of nerve and muscle function, electrical properties of the heart, cardiac sensitivity to electrical stimulation, sensory responses to electrical stimulation, skeletal muscle response to electrical stim ulation, stimulation via electric and magnetic fields, high voltage and high-current injuries, and related safety standards.  Dr. Reilly and Dr. Skuggevigs superior knowledge of the effects of, and the standards for human exposure to electromagnetic field s and electric current are essential to the success of this project.  If this agency were to contract these services from another source, the new source would have to expend numerous years and dollars researching and reviewing data to acquaint itself with human health effects resulting from electric stimulation including electrical principles of nerve and muscle function, electrical properties of the heart, cardiac sensitivity to electrical stimulation, sensory responses to electrical stimulation, skeletal muscle response to electrical stimulation, stimulation via electric and magnetic fields, high voltage and high-current injuries, and related safety standards.  The proposed contract performance period is for approximately 5 months. It is anticipated that t he resultant contract will be firm-fixed-price. This notice is NOT a Request for Proposals, therefore, NO solicitation documents will be issued.

<DESC>NOTICE:  THIS AMENDS THE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED SOLICITATION NOTICE to add the following questions and answers: 

Typical Size:  Ranges from 5 acres up to several hundred (could be 500 to 1000 acres)
 
Geographic concentration:  Scattered throughout the state-mostly northern one third of counties and then along the western side of the state down to Posey Co.  Some in the southeastern portion.  It is just hard to pin down the locations.
 
Appraisers:  In the past NRCS six different appraisals over the past several years- I would say that the bulk of the work was done by three of those six appraisers.  The scenario of saying that three appraisers might do 30 appraisals in a given year would be the most accurate scenario of what has been done in Indiana.
 
Time constraints:  NRCS must complete appraisals and make offers on easements before June 1 , 2006.  In the appraisal work in the past NRCS did not set specific turnaround times-but mostly typically the work was completed within a month or so.  Any appraisals ordered under the proposed BPAs would have a definite delivery date of them.
 
Clarification of the contract limitation stated in BPA Section A.4.  Is it correct 1) that no appraisal or review appraisal will ever exceed $35,000  This means that no combination of appraisals ordered at one time will exceed $35,000. and 2) that in the 3 year term of the BPA the maximum of all appraisal contracts Clarion Associates Inc. would perform would not exceed $100,000?   This means that we do not anticipate awarding more than $100,000 to any one appraiser during the three year period.  However this was a sample BPA and we may change this statement when we actually award to say not more than $100,000 during a year.

<DESC>Amendment 1, issued 1/31/06:  Solicitation number is DTFAAC-05-R-02307, as shown on the first attachment titled , Solicitation.  Please, reference this number in all correspondence. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The FAA, MMAC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement to obtain public relations writer and graphic design services for the Enterprise Services Center (ESC).  The ESC will utilize public relation writer services to market its products and services. The purpose of this requirement is to give the ESC the capability to craft compelling advertising text, develop professional brochure text, communicate to its customers, and prepare polished, professional communication materials for its employees.  The writer will be required to write brochures and descriptions of the ESC programs and capabilities, prepare and submit applications for national and agency awards, and develop proposals and briefings as described in the Statement of Work (SOW). The FAA contemplates the use of an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract with time-and-material pricing arrangement and use of task orders.  The resultant contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base 1-year period with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the government.   This acquisition will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS).  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of "Best Value to the FAA".  Best Value is defined as the Government's willingness to pay more for a superior proposal if there are added benefits, which justify the additional cost. The FAA has determined to narrow potential offerors to Small Businesses located within a 50-mile radius of the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, OK at the time of this announcement.  This limited geographical requirement is based on the considerable amount of time the contractor will be required to spend at the MMAC.  The contractor will interact on a daily basis with the Program Director of the ESC, managers, and organizations.  It is preferred that the offeror has performed communications work on behalf of federal governmental and/or quasi business organizations like the ESC that have a combined government-business role and which need to communicate both internally and externally.  The FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Business Declaration form is required to be completed, signed, and submitted with your response to this solicitation.  Vendors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov/ at the time of receipt of proposals. The date and time for receipt of responses is 2:00 p.m. CST, Wednesday, March 1, 2006, (facsimile responses are not permitted).  Any responses received after 2:00 p.m. CST, Wednesday, March 1, 2006, will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.  Oral or written communications with vendors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary.

In addition, the new contract will include award term incentive provisions that will allow for extension of the performance period another three years through 30 Sep 2016.  Large businesses considering participating in this acquisition as the prime contractor should be prepared to meet a small business subcontract goal of at least 20%. The C26B/RC-26B is a militarized version of the FAA-type certificated Fairchild SA227-DC aircraft. The aircraft is powered by twin Honeywell TPE331-12UA-701G turboprop engines. The current fleet consists of 22 aircraft, 11 Air National Guard (ANG), and 11 Army National Guard (ARNG). The aircraft are currently based at 19 CONUS and 1 OCONUS locations (see below. The ARNG (C-26B) mission is to provide time-sensitive movement of personnel and cargo, as well as limited medical evacuation. The ANG (RC-26B) aircraft have been modified as Information, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) support aircraft carrying specialized electronic equipment to provide aerial surveillance and reconnaissance for law enforcement and other Government agencies. The aircraft Main Operating Base (MOB) locations for the ANG are: Fresno ANGB, CA; Clarksburg, WV; Jacksonville, FL; Kirtland AFB, NM; Meridian MS; Houston, TX; Syracuse, NY; Fairchild AFB, WA; Tucson, AZ; Madison, WI; and Montgomery, AL.     The MOB locations for the ARNG are: Clarksburg, WV; Wheeler AF, HI; Madison, WI; Raleigh-Durham, NC; Buckley ANGB, CO; Dobbins AFB, GA; Rickenbacker ANGB, OH; Otis ANGB, MA; Columbia, SC; Little Rock, AR; and Ft Belvoir, VA.     The Contractor shall assign site staff to provide technical maintenance skills with FAA Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) licensed technicians at each MOB.

The CLS system includes all aircraft maintenance and inspections, launch and recovery of the aircraft, supply of all contractor owned spares and unique support equipment through a Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS); repair and overhaul of all repairable spares at Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified repair stations; maintenance and repair of all support equipment; aircraft paint; propeller and engine repair/overhaul. These actions include supply, procurement, production control, quality control, component failure reports, and acquisition of commercial data. The Contractor provides for additional support, as over and above tasks, engineering services including development, test and FAA certification of modifications, installation of modifications, depot maintenance support, field team support (worldwide), aircraft crash investigations and damage repair. The Contractor also provides information for: quality, contract funds status, consumption and usage, service engineering reports, subscription services for technical manual updates and service actions.     The contractor is to establish and maintain agreements with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for data and technical support necessary to maintain the C-26B/RC-26B aircraft.

The ARNG Operational Support Airlift (OSA) C-26B fleet must each meet a monthly Mission Capability (MC) rate per aircraft of not less than 85%, of which 80% must be Fully Mission Capable (FMC) per aircraft. The ANG (ISR) RC-26B fleet must each meet a monthly MC rate of not less than 85% per aircraft, of which 75% must be FMC per aircraft (the special ISR equipment will be under Flying Hours). MC rate is defined as the total reportable hours in a month less total hours an aircraft is not available for operational use while it is undergoing maintenance or awaiting a part, divided by the total reportable hours in a month. The planned utilization rates for the ANG (ISR) RC-26B aircraft are 55 Hrs/Month and 660 Hrs/Year. The planned utilization rates for the ARNG (OSA) C-26 aircraft are 60 Hrs/Month and 720 Hrs/Year. Although the C-26B/RC-26B is a public use aircraft, the contractor shall maintain the fleet in accordance with (IAW) FAA-approved maintenance standards to maintain its FAA-type certification. Any off-equipment maintenance that exceeds maintenance capabilities at the MOB shall be accomplished at Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 145 FAA-certified repair stations. Non-certified ISR specific equipment shall be maintained using the appropriate vendor data and Government furnished manuals. The Government will provide fuel for the aircraft and support equipment.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR SMALL BUSINESS INTEREST IN THE C-26 CLS PROGRAM

RFP N00019-05-R-1586  C-26 CLS effort

NAVAIR is requesting that any company that is a small business under NAICS code 488190 and is interested in being the prime contractor for this effort submit information that will allow the Contracting Officer to determine that the Government can expect to receive viable offers from at least two responsible, competing SBs capable of performing the work set out in the draft Statement of Work.  The top level SOW for (N00019-05-R-0024) will reside on the NAVAIR Home Page (http://www.navair.navy.mil). 

Companies are reminded that the effort calls for line level (Navy ìOî level) maintenance and repair of aircraft at three sites:  Barking Sands HW (three a/c), Sigonella Italy (two a/c) and Naples Italy (two a/c).  These locations are subject to change.  The contractor is expected to provide adequate staffing to keep the a/c flying at a minimum availability rate of 80%.  The company must cover all costs associated with hiring personnel, transporting them to the site, passports/visas, health/medical records or requirements, etc. 
Each company should provide information, including financial capability, sufficient to convince the Contracting Officer that it can provide the services and personnel in a manner that will not jeopardize current, ongoing operations.

This synopsis is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The information being requested is more than normally provided by a regular, company capabilities statement, previously requested 07 December.  The purpose of this information is to assist the Government in determining whether or not this effort should be a small business set-aside.

<DESC>On November 15, 2005, the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Directorate, Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) published a Sources Sought notice at FedBizOps (Solicitation Number CT 060002542). This notice requested that interested companies submit a short summary of company CTR-related capabilities and a brief White Paper outlining an approach to a fictional CTR-related scenario. DTRA appreciates the numerous responses. The responses displayed a range of relevant broad and niche skill sets. The CTR Directorate has completed its assessment of the responses and has determined that a new acquisition will not be initiated to replace the current multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for threat reduction work. The responses will be kept on file. We will use the information to assist us in our market research for contracting actions necessary to support CTR requirements in the future.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational and planning purposes only.  Please note that the Air Force will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this request for information.  In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular Number A-76 dated May 29, 2003, the United States Air Force, Air Mobility Command (AMC) is in the process of conducting Preliminary Planning, which includes Market Research, for the Engine Management (EM) functions at:  Dover AFB, DE; Dyess AFB, TX; Fairchild AFB, WA; Grand Forks AFB, ND; Little Rock AFB, AR; McConnell AFB, KS; MacDill AFB, FL; Pope AFB, NC; Robins AFB, GA; and Travis AFB, CA. There are approximately 49 total full-time equivalents (FTEs) positions combined at the 10 locations currently performing the EM functions.  

The Engine Management (EM) performance requirements are as follows:

A.  Monitors removal, repair and/or replacement on assigned engines, components, and support equipment.  This includes (1) using the Maintenance Information System (MIS) and Comprehensive Engine Management System (CEMS) to include processing of a daily transaction summary, inventory status lists, and engine manager data lists, and conduct quarterly data integrity audits between MIS and CEMS for all associated programs; and (2) manage Time Compliance Technical Orderís (TCTOs) and Time Change Itemís (TCIs) for assigned and installed engines, components, and support equipment to include (i) forecasting and release of engines for scheduled change, (ii) ordering parts, maintain inventory stock, and issuing parts to complete scheduled maintenance requirements to include coordinating transportation of parts and monitoring cannibalization actions through the Regional Supply System, (iii) providing TCI information (cycles remaining, engine operating time, etc.) on serially controlled items, and (iv) monitoring Estimated Time in Completion (ETIC) reported in MIS.
	
B.	Track specific maintenance actions on an assigned engines, components, or support equipment.  This includes (1) maintaining and updating historical engine records in the MIS (G081) and CEMS for tracking all assigned engines, installed components, and support equipment to include (i) inputting and updating all applicable data in the MIS (G081) and CEMS, (ii) verifying and reconciling all update transactions (e.g., times, TCTO, part removal and installations) are input before a maintenance action is undertaken, and (iii) semi-annually verifying historical engine records.
	
C.	Monitor engine performance data on aircraft wing and test cell to include conducting research and updating engine records.

D.

H.	Perform EM training, attend annual CEMS conference, and coordinate with overseas installations regarding EM functions, procedures, etc.
  
The information gathered from this RFI will be used, along with other information, to determine both private sector interest and the competition parameters should AMC decide that Engine Management is a viable candidate for an A-76 public-private competition. The information requested by this synopsis will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.  Should a future requirement evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated that the period of performance will be a base year plus four one-year option periods.  For purposes of this synopsis the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 488190 and the small business size standard is $6.5M.  AMC requests any qualified businesses that are capable and potentially interested in performing Engine Management services to reply to this RFI stating their interest and submit a capability package to include the following information:  1)  name and address of company; 2) company point of contact including telephone, fax, and email address; 3) identify business size (large, small, disadvantaged,  women-owned, 8 (a), HUBZone, etc); and 4) information demonstrating the companyís ability to perform the potential requirement as described above.  In addition, we request that capability packages include your current and past performance contract references relating to Engine Management services to include: contract number; agency or organization supported; whether or not contractor was a prime or a subcontractor; period of performance; original, current, and total contract value; POC (customerís technical monitor) with current telephone, fax number and email address; and a brief description of the effort.  Also, provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost for providing nonpersonal services to furnish all labor (e.g., to include direct and indirect labor such as management and supervision), supplies and materials, and overhead (e.g., to include operations and general and administrative overhead) necessary in supporting the EM services function.  The ROM should be an estimated cost per engine type to perform EM at each location for the KC-135 (F108 engine), C-5 (TF39 engine), and C-130 (T56 engine).  The estimated number of engines are 297 - TF39 engines for the C5 between Dover and Travis AFBs, 486 - F108 engines for the KC-135 between Fairchild, Grand Forks, MacDill, McConnell, and Robbins AFBs, and 372 - T56 engines for the C-130 between Pope, Little Rock and Dyess AFBs.  Please limit the capability package to 20 pages.  The capability package must be clear, concise, and complete and be submitted by 10 Feb 2006, 12:00 p.m central via e-mail to Rickey.Mabry@scott.af.mil.  Please refer any questions to the referenced e-mail address or to (618) 256-9964.

<DESC>The Government is planning to issue a sole-source award to The Raytheon Company, 180 Hartwell Road, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730 for the above referenced subject.  It is anticipated that subcontracting possibilities may be available for this action.  Interested parties should contact Raytheon directly for further information. The RAID/Eagle Eye is a force protection asset that provides an elevated sensor to enable the commanders to monitor, assess, and act with the right degree of force to defeat threat activity from a safe distance.  The system provides coverage with an electr o-optic (EO) color daytime camera, an infrared (IR) black/white day or night camera, and a laser range finder with pointing azimuth indicator for precisely locating targets of interest out to 13KM (personnel) or 20KM (vehicles).  These elevated sensors pro vide 24/7 360-degree visual coverage to detect, track, identify, and take appropriate action against enemy mortar, rocket propelled grenade and small arms attacks.    The requirements of this action are to provide a basic award for contractor logistics support of the RAID and Eagle Eye Systems to the RAID Product Office (RPO) in FYs 06, 07 and 08.  An option is included for surge requirements.  The total estimated cost for this action is $73,600,000.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking information from qualified providers,  vendors and suppliers who can supply IPv6 cyber security commercial items  as  defined below.  Background. IPv6 is the next generation internet protocol.  IPv6 fixes  several  problems in IPv4, such as limitations on the quantity of available IPv4  addresses. It also adds numerous improvements to IPv4 in areas such as  routing  and network configuration. IPv6 is expected to gradually replace IPv4,  with the  two protocols coexisting for a number of years during a transition period.   The  Federal government has mandated a transition of infrastructure/network  backbones to IPv6 by June 2008. At this time there is no planned solicitation based on this RFI/Market  Survey,  therefore no cost or pricing information should be submitted. This RFI/Market Survey is focusing on obtaining information on commercial  items  (hardware and software) which can specifically amplify an organizations  IPv6  cyber security posture with commercial items such as but not limited to: ÑX Firewalls ÑX Network based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) ÑX Network based Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) ÑX Host-based IDP/IPS solutions ÑX Detection and prevention of Denial of Service (DoS), Malicious Code,  Unauthorized Access, or Inappropriate Usage, etc ÑX Packet Inspection ÑX Vulnerability Management ÑX Network Discovery ÑX Monitoring tools ÑX Forensic tools ÑX IPSec management ÑX Any other commercial item specifically relating to IPv6 cyber security This RFI/Market Survey IS seeking information from vendors who can provide  commercial items which CURRENTLY and ONLY meet this part of the definition  of  commercial item as defined by FAR 2.101: Commercial item means°X (1) Any  item,  other than real property, that is of a type customarily used by the  general  public or by non-governmental entities for purposes other than  governmental  purposes, and°X (i) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general  public; or  (ii) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public;  This RFI/Market Survey IS NOT seeking information pertaining to  °ßcommercial  items not yet available in the commercial marketplace°®.  This RFI/Market Survey IS NOT seeking information from vendors who can  only  provide services but not commercial items.  This RFI/Market Survey IS NOT seeking information about products such as  operating systems, routers, switches, etc unless there is a specific  additive  security component which the vendor has incorporated outside of normal  IPv6  operation.  Interested vendors shall submit a maximum 5 page narrative description  specifically focusing on IPv6 attributes for each commercial item which  should  include: ÑX Description of the item ÑX Item characteristics, performance features, throughput, (hardware,  software,  appliance) etc ÑX Item product certifications (i.e. Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL)) ÑX If applicable, describe any unique licensing features, annual  maintenance  offered, and/or annual subscriptions offered ÑX Each interested vendor must furnish their GSA Federal Supply Schedule  (FSS)  information in connection to their product(s), namely: FSS contract  number, SIN  and CLIN numbers. Please include a copy of this information in your  submission.  Any interested vendor who does not have their product(s) on FSS should  state  this in their submission. Accompanying the 5 page narrative, the vendor may submit existing product  data  sheets and white papers amplifying the products IPv6 technical security  characteristics and use.  Data sheets and white papers are not included in  the  5 page narrative limit.  A vendor with multiple products may submit a 5  page  narrative with the respective accompanying data sheets/white papers for  each  product.  Grouping of similar product families into one 5 page submission  with  accompanying data sheets/white papers is recommended and permissible.

<CONTACT>Connie  Houpt, 405/954-7820
<DESC>The FAA, MMAC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement to obtain public relations writer and graphic design services for the Enterprise Services Center (ESC).  The ESC will utilize public relation writer services to market its products and services. The purpose of this requirement is to give the ESC the capability to craft compelling advertising text, develop professional brochure text, communicate to its customers, and prepare polished, professional communication materials for its employees.  The writer will be required to write brochures and descriptions of the ESC programs and capabilities, prepare and submit applications for national and agency awards, and develop proposals and briefings as described in the Statement of Work (SOW). The FAA contemplates the use of an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract with time-and-material pricing arrangement and use of task orders.  The resultant contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base 1-year period with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the government.   This acquisition will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS).  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of "Best Value to the FAA".  Best Value is defined as the Government's willingness to pay more for a superior proposal if there are added benefits, which justify the additional cost. The FAA has determined to narrow potential offerors to Small Businesses located within a 50-mile radius of the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, OK at the time of this announcement.  This limited geographical requirement is based on the considerable amount of time the contractor will be required to spend at the MMAC.  The contractor will interact on a daily basis with the Program Director of the ESC, managers, and organizations.  It is preferred that the offeror has performed communications work on behalf of federal governmental and/or quasi business organizations like the ESC that have a combined government-business role and which need to communicate both internally and externally.  The FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Business Declaration form is required to be completed, signed, and submitted with your response to this solicitation.  Vendors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov/ at the time of receipt of proposals. The date and time for receipt of responses is 2:00 p.m. CST, Wednesday, March 1, 2006, (facsimile responses are not permitted).  Any responses received after 2:00 p.m. CST, Wednesday, March 1, 2006, will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.  Oral or written communications with vendors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary.

4.	BACKGROUND

The Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS) is a world wide enterprise. DAPS provides document automation and print services for all Federal Departments and Defense Agencies.  We are a Service Level organization under the Defense Logistics Agency.  The DAPS headquarters office is located in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.   There are 157 DAPS field activities located throughout the continental US and overseas.  DAPS has $383 million in annual sales and 750,000 in-house orders annually.  DAPS performs conversion, document management, mainframe printing, duplicating, copier management, graphics design, digital printing and various other document automation services.     

DAPS Online is the primary online tool for customerís to access DAPS services.  This tool has evolved over the past 10 years and was developed using a government contractor.  It originated as a client/server configuration and was migrated to a web application as internet use became common place.  The intent of the original tool was to provided a means by which customerís anywhere could submit their print documents electronically to a DAP facility anywhere.  Additional functionality was added as needed and the DAPS Online business model changed and expanded into new business areas.  The simple job submission tool now offers new services to customers such as ìsoft proofingî while expanding utilization on the production plant for workflow. 

Print-Industry consulting companies forecast the use of web tools to continue to expand offering additional value added features for customers while offering streamlined production efficiencies for the production plant.   The current DOL system has reached modification limits and without a total rework it is expected to have stability and performance issues.  It is for this reason DAPS has begun its search for a robust, leading-edge, next generation tool to replace the present DOL.      

5.	AS-IS STATE

5.1.	Current Configuration

DAPS Online is a web-based, e-commerce print solution consisting of a customer order, accounting, plant workflow, and reports/management modules.  The enterprise configuration includes 11 independent web servers located at the following DAPS  Sites:  Pearl Harbor, HI; Jacksonville, FL;  Norfolk, VA; Philadelphia, PA; Oklahoma City, OK; San Diego, CA; Great Lakes, IL;  Pensacola, FL;  Bangor, WA; and Wiesbaden, GE.   Each of these servers supports 3000 to 4000 customers within their geographical area.  Each server supports 12-20 subordinate print plants who access the order through the internet.  

DAPS Online is built on Microsoft Windows 2000/2003 Advanced Server, Apache/Tomcat, MS SQL and Java technology.  

5.2.	Customer Module

Customers use their browser to self-register, submit job orders, set up funding accounts, view job status, run account reports, upload files and view soft proofing. Customers can be identified as job approval officials or funds approval officials and therefore must approve job submission.  

5.3.	Accounting Module

The accounting module includes submission of funding (government purchase orders and credit cards), verification of funds, changing of funds total, job estimating and billing.  Both customers and plant users have access to portions of the accounting module.

5.4.	Plant Workflow Module

Plant users receive emails to notify them a job has been received for their plant and needs processing.  Using their browser, plant users view all the jobs in all phases.  Jobs can be opened and print requirements reviewed and, if files have been attached by the customer, plant users can open the attached files.  Jobs are estimated using a online pricing sheet, produced and processed for final billing all through the plant workflow module.  

5.5.	Management Module

Plant Managers can view all jobs for all plants on their DOL Server through their browser.  They can re-distribute jobs to other plants within their group to manage workload balancing. 

5.6.	Reports

Various redefined reports are generated on demand.  Types of reports include, on time delivery,  turn around time,  Work-in-Progress, and Jobs submitted by customer.  

5.7.	Administration

Super Users can access the application through their web browser.  The Administrative module permits super users to add new users, add new plants, change users profiles, and change application settings.

5.8.	Interfaces

Each DOL Server sends funding and billing information to a middleware server.  The purpose of this connection is to validate funds availability and balance, hold inventory and funds during the estimate process, and deplete inventory and funding during the billing process.  The connection occurs every minute and files are sent in batch mode to the middleware via https. 

Pricing files are received through the middleware interface.  Pricing files update the pricing tables in DOL with the up-to-date unit pricing and pricing codes.  

Price code to inventory code files are received through the middleware interface. Price code to inventory code files updates the inventory price tables in DOL.  This information is used to identify and associate price codes with inventory codes.  A single price code may have many inventory codes associated.  

There are no accounting or inventory balances maintained in DAPS Online.  All inventory and account balances are maintained in the DAPS Accounting System. 




5.9.	Federal Guidelines

As a U.S. Government entity, DAPS and its technology systems are required to conform with federal guidelines, where applicable.  Examples include, but are not limited to:

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d)
DODI 8500
DLA Standard Web Coding SCM-STA.CD.6000
DAL Standard Web Database SCM-STA.DA.6000
DLA Standard Web Design SCM-STA.DE.6000
DISA Application Security Developers Guide

<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for the Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP) Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Secondary Payload ñ NASA Langley Research Center (LARC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, non-profit organizations, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate in developing a proposal for the Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP) Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Secondary Payload Opportunity.   BACKGROUND: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) has an opportunity to include a small secondary payload with the launch of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) scheduled for October 2008, reference: ESMD-RLEP-RFI-2006, posted via the internet at: http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/synopsis.cgi?acqid=118610 NASA Headquarters is soliciting proposals internally from the NASA field centers for existing or reasonably matured concepts that offer a cost-effective contribution to the Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP). If an internal proposal demonstrates a concept beneficial to RLEP, then NASA may select it for further development and eventual launch. The NASA internal selection process is a two-step process, with a Step 1, 15-page proposal due mid-February, 2006 and a Step 2 detailed proposal due mid March, 2006. While NASA will serve as the prime entity for these internally-developed proposals, NASA is encouraging teaming between the field centers and industry, academia, other federal labs and FFRDCs. LARC is leading a proposal development effort in response to this Internal Call for Proposals (ICP).  The overall objective of RLEP is to conduct a series of precursor missions to the Moon prior to human return, as required by the Vision for Space Exploration. The ICP identifies the requirement that proposed RLEP LRO Secondary Payload concepts must advance the Vision for Space Exploration in one or more of the following mission areas: a.Missions that advance lunar science by providing data or knowledge.  b.Missions that characterize the lunar environment. c.Missions that support identification of sites for future human missions as well as the potential utility of those sites. d.Missions that test or demonstrate technology that could enhance future exploration. e.Missions operational concepts in support of exploration activities. f.Missions that develop or emplace infrastructure in support of exploration activities. g.Missions that advance commercial opportunities- either in terms of incentivizing new commercial approaches to doing NASAís business or by developing long-term opportunities at the Moon. h.Missions that collect engineering data to support development activities of the Constellation elements. OVERVIEW: Teaming offers will be reviewed, evaluated, and selected at LARC.  LARC anticipates selecting multiple partners with whom LARC would then immediately work directly and individually to finalize LARCís proposals in response to the internal call for proposals. During the proposal development phase, more specific roles and cost estimates for the selected partners will be developed. For any LARC proposal that is selected by NASA Headquarters, LARC intends to award contract(s) or other agreements with each selected proposal partner.  DETAILS OF THE OPPORTUNITY:NASA LARC is seeking potential partners to formulate a responsive, customer-centered proposal in response to the NASA ESMD ICP received on 1/26/06. The RLEP LRO Secondary Payload Opportunity has a target Mission cost of $50M inclusive of adaptors, payload and mission ops costs.  Mission concepts exceeding $80M will not be considered. The RLEP LRO Secondary Payload is independent of the RLEP Lunar Robotic Orbiter (LRO) and must be ready to launch in October 2008.  Potential partners are requested to provide technical information to describe their interests and capabilities to develop, integrate, and test a system that can successfully complete a mission as a LRO secondary payload that makes a cost-effective contribution to the RLEP. Please provide experience, capabilities and facilities that are relevant to achieving NASA ESMDís RLEP goals of lunar surface mobility, lunar surface communication, and lunar surface characterization.  Partner selection(s) will be made by LARC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel:  This criterion evaluates the offerorís relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control: This criterion evaluates the offerorís ability to control both cost and schedule. The offeror should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the offerorís facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration proposed. The offeror should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. LARC anticipates completing its evaluation and selection process by February 10, 2006, in accordance with the expected schedule of the NASA internal call for proposals.	NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in response to this synopsis nor will NASA pay for any costs incurred by the selected partners in assisting LARC in the preparation of LARCís internal proposal. This synopsis teaming opportunity does not represent a guarantee to selection of award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited.  RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to seven (7) pages that fully address the evaluation criteria in not less than 12-point font. To facilitate the governmentís evaluation and selection, a single response is requested from each respondent.  All responses shall be submitted electronically in Microsoft 2003 applications (Word, Excel, Access and Power Point) or Adobe Acrobat Portable Data Format (PDF) format, by 5 p.m. EST on February 7, 2006 to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Gaudy Bezos-OíConnor, Building 1212, Room 119, Hampton, VA 23681.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Request For Information - Software for Mainframe Disaster Recovery Needs
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFI-06-1007
<RESPDATE>021406
<ARCHDATE>03012006
<CONTACT>Patrice Coleman, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-594-2016, Fax 410-965-9560, Email patrice.coleman@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is currently doing market research for software products to meet IBM zSeries mainframe disaster recovery needs.  SSA is seeking products to meet the following capabilities as described below:  

The software product needs to minimizes data loss and service outage time in the event of a disaster by logging database system update information in real-time at another site.  The product should also duplicate log or journal data and other recovery information at an alternate site and can use that data to recover databases to within seconds of the disaster.  

Any product must perform the following functions: 

(1)Collect log or journal data and associated recovery information as it is created by an IBM zSeries Mainframe.
(2)Transmit the collected data immediately via an SNA/VTAM or TCP/IP communication links to another host IBM zSeries Mainframe.
(3)Handle any temporary loss of communications link by buffering the collected log or journal data on a disk spill file.  When communications are re-established, send the buffered data and resynchronizes operations with the receiving site.
(4)Detect and recover automatically from a system failure at either the sending site or the receiving site by identifying, retrieving, and transmitting log data that may otherwise have been lost by the failure. 
(5)Save transmitted data at the receiving site, first to disk and then to designated archives. 
(6)Support the following DBMS types: DB2, CA-IDMS
and the following log-producing middleware:
CICS and CICS TransactionServer, MQ Series and VSAM

Additionally, any equivalent product must:
(1)Require no changes to applications.
(2)Send log or journal data to the receiving site with no added I/O overhead.
(3)Use standard operator commands and responses with user specified routing and descriptor codes.
(4)Support software duplexing of control and data files.
(5)Automatically reformat log data to enable automated data shadowing and to reduce disaster recovery time.
(6)Use dynamic disk space allocation for flexibility and adaptability.
(7)Use MVS cross-memory services to efficiently acquire log or journal data from database management systems.
(8)Use standard logging exits if provided by DBMS, and provide a user-exit for logical record filtering.
(9)Be sysplex enabled and support n-way data sharing in DB2.

The software product should accomplish the following features:

The capability to restore critical CICS VSAM files to a point in time less than one hour from failure. Either the software should have the capability to duplicate the critical datasets to remote mirrored DASD or periodic remote backups that could be recovered with CICS log data containing all updates since the last backup. A software solution should require minimal overhead to CPU, DASD, storage or bandwidth. Transmission of this data must be compatible with the current SSA supported network protocols. This software should include the following features:

(1)Logs updates made to datasets by Batch applications, therefore allowing recovery of VSAM data from both Batch and CICS updates.
(2)Allow for quick recovery when a CICS batch update job either ABENDS or is run in error.
(3)Recover updates from log records that reside on either the log streams written to by CICS/Batch or copies of the log streams.
(4)Provide the capability to restore the VSAM file and perform forward recover using the CICS logs.

The software product should capture updates to the primary DB2 databases in real-time. The capture process should generate negligible overhead and cause little to no degradation in DB2 response times. The software will then need to transmit these updates via a standard networking protocol to a remote location. Once the updates are received at the remote location, the software will need to apply these updates to a second copy of the database on a continual basis. The ultimate goal of the product is to give SSA the ability to switch dynamically from the primary copy of the database to the secondary copy in the event of a disaster, providing continuous availability of the DB2 data.

The software product should capture updates to the primary IDMS databases in real-time.
This software should accomplish the following:

(1)Continuously apply updates to the shadow database, using journal data transmitted by a standard networking protocol to a remote location. 
(2)Facilitates a transfer of processing to the shadow environment within seconds, delivering the highest possible level of availability to your user community. 
(3)Uses only a fraction of the computer resources required at the primary site. 
(4)Requires no changes to application software. 
(5)Provides a distributed fault-tolerant capability, which can be employed in a wide variety of scenarios, from hardware and software failure to major disasters. 

Any firm that feels they have the capability of providing a product should respond, in writing, within 15 days of this notice.  Responses must be specific as to the product proposed and must include detailed specifications to support said claims.  Vendors may submit pricing data.  This is NOT a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  The Government will not award a contract based on responses received; however, SSA will use this information to assess capable sources.  SSA will NOT provide acknowledgement of responses received.  Submittal of information ELECTRONICALLY is preferred and faxed information will NOT be accepted. All questions should be submitted by E-MAIL ONLY to the Contract Specialist listed as point of contact for the RFI posting; NO phone calls will be accepted. If mailed, responses must be addressed to the following office:
	
	Social Security Administration
	Office of Acquisition and Grants
	Attention: Patrice M. Coleman

The Command manages acquisition throughout the entire product life cycle, to include post fielding operational support.  Consequently, MARCORSYSCOM requires a world-class comprehensive, enterprise-wide information technology system to assist the command in meeting its Acquisition and Total Life Cycle Systems Management (TLCSM) responsibilities.  This system will be the Integrated Digital Environment (IDE) for Acquisition and Product Life Cycle Management.  The Marine Corps IDE program creates a seamless, collaborative, digital-based (network-centric) business environment around the key enabling processes of the acquisition, life cycle/product support community. The IDE provides a capability that facilitates the work processes and documentation requirements of the Department of Defense (DoD) 5000 Series (DoDD 5000.1 and DoDI 5000.2), MARCORSYSCOM ìEquipping Processî, Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) ìCapabilities Based Test Processî  and associated policies and procedures. It supports acquisition program management by providing an integrated project-centric work environment, data repository, tool kit, and acquisition common operational picture aimed at increased performance, reduced cost, and shortened schedule for programs. Additionally, the IDE shall provide the foundation for future capabilities-based management of programs as portfolios. The IDE will: ∑	Improve business processes, enabling streamlined activities supported by the application of relevant knowledge ∑	Provide visibility into the acquisition process and information for the workforce and appropriate stakeholders ∑	Implement appropriate and cost-effective tools for virtual collaboration and data management ∑	Generate and manage current, reusable, and interoperable data ∑	Provide secure and controlled web-based access and delivery of data ∑	Leverage enterprise software and infrastructure for common processes ∑	Leverage the existing MARCORSYSCOM, and USMC IT environment ∑	Capture appropriate data, in context, and preserve it for reuse. The IDE business environment will also include and support the information management and business process requirements of the Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) beginning in Increment-1 and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) in future increments.  Conference: Attendance to this Industry Day is recommended for all vendors interested in the IDE.  Please refer to the MARCORSYSCOM vendor web page: http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/vendor/idenews.asp for additional information and updates on the IDE Industry Day and program, including the Draft RFP, Draft Statement of Work (SOW), and other supporting documentation.

B. Full text of announcement
I.  Description 
In accordance with FAR 35.007(j), the Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) requests information on research ideas and approaches that could provide superior theoretical insights to guide the design and deployment of next-generation wireless mobile networks. The requested information is sought to inform an anticipated research program on ìInformation Theory for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networksî (ITMANET). DARPA currently anticipates that the envisioned program would be funded in the 6.1 budget category at a level of approximately $13,500,000 over five years.  DARPA anticipates funding at most two cross-institution teams to conduct this long-term fundamental research. A Broad Agency Announcement and/or other solicitation may be posted later this year. In addition to a conventional solicitation, DARPA anticipates that special arrangements will be made to encourage responses from cross-institution teams of early-career Young Investigators, to be tentatively defined as untenured faculty having completed their PhD less than 5 years prior to the response deadline of the potential solicitation(s).

The first objective of the ITMANET program is to close the open problem concerning the capacity limits of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). A crowning achievement of information theory has been to characterize the upper capacity bounds of an additive Gaussian white-noise channel; similar insight is sought into the limitations of future networks. However, unlike Shannonís source-channel-sink capacity formulation, the desired formulation will take into account not just bandwidth, signal, and noise levels but rather a wider range of dimensions including energy, latency, computation, mobility, traffic characteristics (including bursty and diverse source types), topology, overhead, and node heterogeneity. The desired formulation would characterize constants and bounds both asymptotically and for specific network instances. And finally, unlike present research results which are based on specific technology choices (multihop routing, scheduling with spatial re-use, successive interference cancellation, etc) the desired results would provide technology-independent guidance for future research much as the AWGN capacity formula has provided targets for wireless modulation schemes.

The second program objective is to understand and exploit implications of the newly developed theory. For example, another crowning achievement of present information theory has been the source-channel separation theorem, which has substantial architectural implications. If similar separation theorems can be developed for MANETs, we may be able to discern a theoretically motivated network stack that will be more appropriate for MANETs than present wireline-oriented architectures. 

Another category of desirable insight concerns design implications for future network protocols. For instance, researchers are investigating store-carry-forward protocols for disruption-tolerance in mobile networks; researchers are also investigating network coding protocols for capacity improvement. Since both investigations exploit memory at the routing nodes, it is natural to expect that a unified theory of MANET capacity would reveal a deep relationship between these two concepts leading to a unified protocol. As a second example, researchers have suggested technologies such as successive interference cancellation (SIC) that can involve cooperative diffusion of information;  network coding may again prove deeply related since practical protocols may involve a similar cooperative diffusion. As a third example, emerging physical smart antenna technologies offer degrees of freedom concerning interference cancellation, MIMO, and beam-forming; the relationship between such choices and specific higher-layer protocols remains an open question that could be informed by information theory. Fourth, it is unclear to what extent hierarchy, heterogeneity, and multi-channel approaches should play into an overall wireless network deployment, and the desired theory may provide new insights for large-scale network design and deployment. Fifth, the concept of ìsecurity overlayî needs to be factored into network design, and there may be implications for overlay design that arise from better information theory. This list of desirable design insights is certainly not exhaustive, and even posing the right questions requires deeper insight than is presently available.

In sum, there are many questions that may be addressed as a byproduct of better information theory for mobile wireless networks, but the foundations need to be created first. The hypothesis of this anticipated program is that a specific challenge problem --- better understanding of MANET capacity limits --- will lead to actionable implications. 

For purposes of this RFI, the term MANET is not intended to convey conventional limitations such as a focus on flatly routed networks comprising homogeneous nodes. Rather, the term is meant only to suggest the myriad complications arising from future networks incorporating elements of mobility and wireless technology.

To inform the potential program structure and solicitation, DARPA/IPTO is soliciting position papers answering the following questions:

ï	To what extent is a precise characterization of mobile wireless network capacity achievable?
ï	How would one recognize a ìcompleteî mobile wireless network capacity limit formulation if one were to see it?
ï	What is the largest number of problem dimensions (latency, mobility, heterogeneity, etc) for which the responder believes an upper bound on capacity can be understood within the timeframe of a 5-year program?
ï	What enabling insights have recently emerged that give grounds for optimism? Are there any theoretical breakthroughs or experimental results that suggest promising research directions for the proposed program?
ï	What are the principal obstacles to developing the desired theory? What intermediate questions need to be answered to achieve the result? Is it possible to lay out a research agenda that marches inexorably toward the proposed objective of capacity understanding, and what might the agenda involve?
ï	Apart from MANET capacity understanding, what is the most important set of related tractable network-information-theoretic questions that could be addressed within the timespan of the envisioned program? What would be the practical uses of answers to those secondary questions?
ï	 To what extent do results from other fields (e.g. physics) seem to contribute to the desired theory and in what way?

Interested parties should submit their position paper and optional briefing by responding to this RFI as described in Section IV - Application and Submission Information below.

All information contained in the RFI is preliminary, as well as subject to modification, and is in no way binding on the Government. As a result of ideas submitted in response to this RFI, DARPA will acknowledge receipt of the submission, but will not provide feedback. However, DARPA/IPTO might invite selected individuals to present talks,  plan and/or conduct invited workshops on relevant topics, etc. Any material not clearly marked as proprietary will be considered to be public information. All submissions may be handled by non-government personnel bound by nondisclosure agreements. This RFI incorporates by reference FAR 52.215-3, "Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (OCT 1997)," with the same force and effect as if it were given in full text [reference paragraph (c) of this provision, the "purpose" of this RFI is detailed in this announcement].
WORKSHOP
A workshop will be held for RFI respondents, which will present an overview of the ITMANET program concept, and will include invited presentations, submitter presentations, discussions, and Q&A. If interested in attending, please visit the Registration website at http://csc-ballston.dmeid.org/darpa/registration/intro.asp?regCode=yujjuryE. In order to attend the workshop, attendees must be registered on the site by March 1, 2006 and have submitted an RFI response. Acceptance of registration will be conditional upon receipt of a responsive position paper as well as space limitations. Because of space limitations, participation may be restricted to a single representative of a given institution and/or a single co-author of a given position paper. Non-U.S. citizens may attend pending the completion of the Foreign National Information Request Form found on the registration site. Attendance at the workshop is voluntary. Attendance is not required to propose to subsequent Broad Agency Announcements or research solicitations on this topic. There is no fee for attending the workshop, and DARPA will not provide cost reimbursement for workshop attendance.

Workshop participants are invited to brief their RFI responses. Due to limited time, presenters may be selected based upon details of their RFI responses, and time limits on the presentation will be determined based on a variety of factors including the number of presenters and the need to reserve time for other presentations and discussions.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Receivers Loran
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
PURSUANT TO FAR 15.201(e)
INTRODUCTION
The U. S. Coast Guard is developing requirements for a Loran receiver to be used as a component of the Command and Control (C2) system for the U.S. Loran system. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information to assist the U. S. Coast Guard in formulating functional requirements, and identify qualified vendors who are able to meet our requirements.
The U. S. Coast Guard is open to alternative ideas. Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternatives that can help the U. S. Coast Guard better define its requirements and obtain a solution that meets its needs.
BACKGROUND
LORAN-C was originally developed to provide radio navigation service for U.S. coastal waters and was later expanded to include complete coverage of the continental U.S. as well as most of Alaska. Twenty-four U.S. LORAN-C stations work in partnership with Canadian and Russian stations to provide coverage in Canadian waters and in the Bering Sea. LORAN-C provides better than 0.25 nautical mile absolute accuracy for suitably equipped users within the published areas. 
Advances in technology have allowed for greater automation and consolidation of LORAN-C operations. The existing system is being modernized to take advantage of such technology. More information on system modernization may be found at http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/loran/modernization.htm .
THE OPERATING STATUS OF LORAN-C
LORAN-C provides coverage for maritime navigation in U.S. coastal areas. It provides position, navigation, and timing (PNT) services for both civil and military air, land and marine users. LORAN-C is approved as an en route supplemental flight navigation system for both Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) and Visual Flight Rule (VFR) operations. The LORAN-C system serves the 48 continental states, their coastal areas, and parts of Alaska.
While the U. S. Government continues to evaluate the long-term need for the LORAN-C radio navigation system, it will operate the LORAN-C system in the short term. The U.S. Government will give users reasonable notice if it concludes that LORAN-C is not needed or is not cost effective, so that users will have the opportunity to transition to alternative navigation aids. 
PURPOSE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
With this continued operation of the LORAN-C service, users will be able to realize additional benefits. Improvement of GPS time synchronization of the LORAN-C chains and the use of digital receivers may support improved accuracy and coverage of the service. LORAN-C will continue to provide a supplemental means of navigation. Current LORAN-C receivers do not support non-precision instrument approach or harbor entrance approach requirements.
The receiver shall have the ability to use existing and future Additional Secondary Factors (ASF) tables. ASF terms correct for Loran propagation velocity changes over the ground, which result from variations in the Earth°¶s conductivity over the signal path. Additionally, the U. S. Coast Guard adopted the testing of different modulation techniques to further enhance the Loran-C system, establishing a test program for the enhancement of the Loran-C signal pertaining to availability, accuracy, integrity, and continuity. The proposed modulation scheme for this enhanced Loran-C system is known as 9th Pulse Modulation, and it may be reviewed at http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/loran/9th-pulse-modulation-ldc.html . Voluntary submissions for differing modulation techniques to enhance the Loran signal are welcomed. Test programs to enhance the capability of Loran-C were established to allow for the following:

ÑX	°ßAll-In-View°® Receivers: The use of °ßall-in-view°® receivers will no longer be constrained by Loran-chain geometry. 
ÑX	Ongoing collection of ASF correction data.
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to help the U. S. Coast Guard meet the original goals of the Loran-C program and, in particular, to assist the U. S. Coast Guard staff to identify and assess mechanisms for viewing, monitoring and analyzing Loran-C data in the context of a receiver to be used as a component in an operational Command and Control System. We are using this RFI to gather additional information to help the U. S. Coast Guard to understand the capabilities of software receiver technology and to identify qualified vendors who might be able to meet our future requirements.
While this RFI focuses on a new operational Loran receiver, the U. S. Coast Guard remains open to alternative ideas and considerations, as pertaining to the enhancement of the Loran-C signal availability, integrity, accuracy and continuity. Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternative methodologies that may help the U. S. Coast Guard better understand the potential of using differing analog / digital / hybrid modulation schemes to assess whether solutions exist to enhance the capability of Loran-C, while not affecting current users of the Loran-C system.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
PURSUANT TO FAR 15.201(e)

INTRODUCTION
The U. S. Coast Guard is developing requirements for a LORAN-C signal generation and control system to be used as a component of LORAN-C transmitter system. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information to assist the U. S. Coast Guard in formulating functional requirements, and identify qualified vendors who are able to meet our requirements. The U. S. Coast Guard is open to alternative ideas. Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternatives that can help the U. S. Coast Guard better define its requirements and obtain a solution that meets its needs.

BACKGROUND
LORAN-C was originally developed to provide radio navigation service for U.S. coastal waters and was later expanded to include complete coverage of the continental U.S. as well as most of Alaska. Twenty-four LORAN-C stations work in partnership with Canadian and Russian stations to provide coverage in Canadian waters and in the Bering Sea. LORAN-C provides better than 0.25 nautical mile absolute accuracy for suitably equipped users within the published user areas. 

Advances in technology have allowed for greater automation and consolidation of LORAN-C operations. The existing system is being modernized to take advantage of such technology.  More information on system modernization may be found at http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/loran/modernization.htm .

THE OPERATING STATUS OF LORAN-C
LORAN-C provides position, navigation, and timing (PNT) services for both civil and military air, land and marine users. LORAN-C is approved as an en route supplemental flight navigation system for both Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) and Visual Flight Rule (VFR) operations. The LORAN-C system serves the 48 continental states, their coastal areas, and Alaska.
While the U. S. Government continues to evaluate the long-term need for the LORAN-C radio navigation system, it will continue to operate the LORAN-C system in the near term. 

PURPOSE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
The U.S Government is exploring methods of generating and controlling a transmitter drive waveform(s) (TDW) for current LORAN-C non-linear transmitters as well as for controlling possible future expeditionary (portable) linear LORAN-C transmitter/amplifiers.  The system will be required to develop a TDW that will result in the transmission of the ideal LORAN-C pulse at the antenna feed point.  The system must be capable of sampling the resultant pulse(s) and making automated adjustments to the TDW to compensate for variations in the transmission path.  Though the system shall be capable of running in a fully automated mode, the system should allow operators to make adjustments that would result in changes in the transmitted pulse(s). 

At the heart of the LORAN-C system is very precise and highly accurate LORAN-C Timing and Frequency Equipment (TFE).  This system shall be utilized for all reference frequencies and timing triggers for the waveform generation and control system.  Signals that will be made available for use in the TDW generator and control system are attached.
Additionally, the U. S. Coast Guard adopted the testing of different modulation techniques to further enhance the LORAN-C system, establishing a test program for the enhancement of the LORAN-C signal pertaining to availability, accuracy, integrity, and continuity. The proposed modulation scheme for this enhanced LORAN-C system is known as 9th Pulse Modulation, and it may be reviewed at http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/loran/9th-pulse-modulation-ldc.html .

HOW TO RESPOND
Please submit your response to this RFI via email to Jeannie Sansone at Jeannie.L.Sansone@uscg.mil, phone 609.523.7258, by Monday, February 20th, 2006, at 10:00 A.M. EST.
Techinal questions call 609 523-7204 Mr. David Lown
 
TIMING SIGNALS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE WAVEFORM GENERATOR AND CONTROL SYSTEM.

1.  Signals Source.  The signals are developed by the USCG Timing Frequency Equipment (TFE).  There is an °ßOperate°® and a redundant °ßStandby°® TFE.  Each TFE will produce the timing signals for two independent rates.  If necessary for redundancy, two identical sets of signals will be provided via two identical multi-conductor cables (see Table 1 for a further description of that signal cable).  All signals (with the exception of the 5 MHz signal) are a single-ended 12 volt waveform.  The 5 MHz Clock signal is a 5 volt single-ended square wave.

2.  Signals Stability.  Signal stability is derived from three cesium frequency standards.

3.  Dual Rated Station Signal Designators.  Most USCG Loran stations function as parts of two Loran-C °ßChains°® and transmit two different Loran rates.  By convention, the rate with the shorter Group Repetition Interval (GRI) is designated as the °ßHI Rate°®, while the rate with longer GRI is designated as the °ßLO Rate°®. The timing signal names for the respective rates carry the LO and HI designators.  Single rated Loran-C transmitters utilize the LO Rate timing signals.

4.  Phase Coding Designators.  The groups of 8 or 9 Loran-C pulses are phase coded in a different scheme during alternating GRIs.  Two GRIs, A and B, make up what is called the Phase Code Interval (PCI).  In this discussion, for clarity sake, the trigger signals associated with phase coding may carry an additional GRI A or GRI B designator (see Figure 1).

5.  Description of Timing Signals.  The following is a brief description of each of the USCG timing signals that will be provided to the waveform signal generator and control system.  

5.1  5 MHz Clock.  As stated above, the signal stability derives from three cesium standards.  5 MHz from the cesium becomes the clock within the TFE. This signal will be provided to the waveform generator and control system to be used as the master clock.  

5.2  Multipulse Trigger.  The Multipulse Trigger (MPT) is the timing strobe that will be provided to the waveform generator and control system to initiate the generator circuitry.  There will be one MPT provided for each transmitted pulse, 8 or 9 MPTs in each GRI.  The MPTs have a fixed phase relationship with the 5 MHz.  When necessary, the TFE will affect timing adjustments in the signal.  These adjustments will be accomplished by phase shifting both the MPTs and the 5 MHz clock.  
 
5.3  Phase Code Set, Phase Code Reset.  The Phase Code Set (PC SET) and the Phase Code reset (PC RESET) triggers will be provided to the waveform generator and control system to indicate the required phase code of subsequent transmitted pulses.  The phase code of the transmitted pulses is different for Master versus Secondary stations, and is also different for GRI A versus GRI B.  The PC SET trigger indicates that all subsequent Loran-C pulses shall be transmitted with positive phase code, until such time as the PC RESET trigger is received.  Likewise, the PC RESET trigger indicates that all subsequent Loran-C pulses shall be transmitted with negative phase code, until such time as the PC SET trigger is received. (see Figure 3 and figure 4).  

6.  MPT Variations.  There are certain conditions that may require the MPTs to be phase shifted or inhibited.

6.1  Blanking.  At dual rated stations there are recurring periods when the transmitted signals of one Loran rate would overlap the second rate.  To compensate for this, the TFE blanks, or inhibits the MPTs of one rate during those periods of overlap.  Two modes of blanking can be utilized.  The first, called priority blanking, is when one rate is always blanked during overlap, while the second, priority rate is never blanked.  The second mode, called alternate blanking, alternately blanks both rates during periods of overlap.

6.2 Blink Mode.  To alert the navigational users when the transmitted signal may be out of allowable tolerances, the first two pulses in the group of eight, will go into blink mode. In blink mode, the TFE inhibits the MPTs corresponding to the first two pulses of the group for a period of 0.5 seconds out of every 4.5 seconds.  Blink mode occurs for Secondary transmissions, only.  In the event that a Master transmitted signal may be out of allowable tolerances, all Secondary stations in that Loran-C Chain enter blink mode, and offending Master station°¶s transmissions may be completely inhibited.

6.3  Pulse Modulation Communications.  It is possible to communicate information using transmitted Loran-C signals.  Although the Coast Guard does not do so at present, the capability may be desirable in the future.  The pulse modulation scheme would be one where timing of pulses 3 through 8 could be independently shifted, + or °V 5.0 microseconds.  Time shifts, of course, would be accomplished by time shifting the corresponding MPTs.













LORAN-C GROUP REPETITION INTERVAL
AND PHASE CODE INTERVAL



The Group Repetition Interval (GRI) is equal in duration to the basic Loran-C Rate.  Permissible GRIs are multiples of 10 microseconds from 40000 through 99990 microseconds.  The Loran-C rate identifier is the GRI divided by 10 (e.g. 9960 defines a Loran-C Rate with a GRI of 99600 microseconds).  The Phase Code Interval (PCI) is equal in duration to two GRIs, commonly labeled GRI A and GRI B.  The group of 8 or 9 Loran-C pulses transmitted during GRI A are phased differently than the group transmitted during GRI B (see Appendix B).



                                                                                     GRI  B

<SUBJECT>66 -- GPS Dropwindsondes
<DESC>Request for Information.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Marine and Aircraft Operations, (hereinafter referred to as government) intends to perform a technology refresh of the existing government GPS dropwindsonde (hereinafter referred to as dropsonde) design, to incorporate current technology sensors and components.  This request for information relates only to pressure, temperature, and humidity sensor components to be selected for use in the upgraded dropsonde design. The purpose of this request for information is to determine (i) if there are sources capable of satisfying the government's requirements; (ii) availability of commercial items; (iii) the extent to which commercial items or non-development items could be incorporated at the component level.  If commercial items are not available that are suitable to meet the government's needs, the government is interested in determining if non-development items are available that: (a) meet the government's requirements; (b) can  be modified to meet the government's requirements; or (c) can meet the government's requirements if those requirements were modified to a reasonable extent.  Feedback addressing the clarity, feasibility, scope, and potential alternative means of meeting the government's requirement is sought. The government currently deploys an average of 3000 dropsondes per year, for use in missions such as hurricane reconnaissance, atmospheric research, and satellite sensor verification.  The data collected from the dropsondes is of critical importance to accurately forecast severe weather events, and as such, the dropsonde sensors must be accurate and reliable. System requirements:  The dropsonde flight envelope is from the surface up to 20 km.  The dropsonde sensors must survive post launch deceleration forces of up to (~70 Gís @13 km and 210 knots IAS, ~100 Gís @13 km and 250 knots IAS without performance degradation.   Minimum data reporting rate is 2 Hz.  All sensors incorporated in the dropsonde must be fully functional throughout the flight envelope, with the following minimum performance requirements:  Pressure: range 1050 mB to 100 mB, resolution 0.1 mB, accuracy 0.5 mB, sensor response time constant less than 0.01 s; Temperature: range +40 Deg C to  90 Deg C, resolution 0.1 Deg C, accuracy 0.1 Deg C, sensor response time constant (~0.2 sec. @ 1000 mB with 6 m/s flow rate);  Relative Humidity: 0 percent to 100 percent, resolution 1 percent, accuracy 5 percent, sensor response time constant (~0.1 sec @1000 mb at 20 C and  (~10 sec @ -20 C).

<SUBJECT>A -- Threat Agent Cloud Tactical Intercept and Countermeasure (TACTIC) Program Workshop
<DESC>This is a special notice announcement by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) regarding a workshop meeting for the Threat Agent Cloud Tactical Intercept and Countermeasure (TACTIC) Program scheduled for March 2, 2006 in the Washington, DC Area. The purpose of the workshop meeting is to: 1) Promote the interaction of existing and potential technology development performers with potential systems integrator performers; 2) Provide an overview of the program and results of Phase I testing; 3) Share in the knowledge acquired during Phase I of the program; and 4) Generate open dialogue on systems integration approaches. The goal of the TACTIC Program is to provide the US military with a revolutionary capability to protect the warfighter from chemical and biological warfare agent (CWA/BWA) threat clouds released on the battlefield. The program seeks to develop an integrated system that can rapidly detect and identify the presence of a threat cloud and provide a countermeasure to that cloud to defeat it before it reaches the intended target. Additional background information regarding the TACTIC Program can be found at: http://www.darpa.mil/spo/programs/tactic.htm?area=2. This notice is intended solely to inform potential system developers and existing and potential component-level technology developers of the opportunity to discuss their capabilities as they relate to the TACTIC Program. The workshop meeting will be informational in content, describing the critical lessons learned from Phase I of the program as well as laying the groundwork for discussions regarding systems development. This announcement encourages organizations not currently part of the program, which possess innovative component-level capabilities for the detection and/or defeat of chemical/biological agents AND/OR systems integration experience and capabilities, to actively participate in the program. The workshop meeting will be a one-day event consisting of a morning and an afternoon session.  During the morning session, presentations will be delivered to provide a brief overview of current component technologies. The afternoon portion of the workshop will include a poster session to promote discussions among current and potential program participants (posters are required of component technology developers and optional for system integrators). Posters should contain non-proprietary information (dimensions 3 feet x 4 feet). In addition, system developers who are invited to attend the workshop meeting will have the opportunity to discuss their ideas for integration on a one-to-one basis with the TACTIC Program Manager.  Attendance at this meeting will be limited to organizations that can demonstrate a reasonable expectation of having expertise that would contribute to the success of the TACTIC Program. Such expertise is likely to be held by organizations with experience in the fields of chemical and/or biological warfare defense; detection, neutralization, and decontamination; contamination transport modeling; chemical and/or biological sensors; and/or the integration of complex C/B systems. Other areas of expertise may also qualify. In all cases, qualification will be determined by DARPA. Interested parties will need to submit information describing their capabilities and how these capabilities are best suited for TACTIC systems and component level development. Submitted information should be limited to 1 page. DARPA also requests a non-proprietary cover page identifying your company name, address, and technical point of contact.  Responses should be received no later than COB Wednesday, February 15, 2006. Responses should be submitted via email or CD-ROM to: ATTN: Ivan Stanish, Schafer Corporation, 3811 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203, tactic@darpa.mil. DARPA will provide additional meeting details to those organizations invited to the workshop meeting by COB Wednesday, February 22, 2006. Note that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Any proprietary concepts or information should be clearly identified as such. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.

<SUBJECT>--RFI:  Defense Travel System, Travel Management Operations and Sustainment Procurement
<DESC>RFI: Defense Travel System Travel Management Operations and Sustainment Procurement Note:  To view this RFI with original formatting, graphics and attachment, go to: http://www.dtstravelcenter.dod.mil/dtsrfi/ Introduction: This is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested sources by the Program Management Office  Defense Travel System (PMO-DTS) regarding commercial best practices and commercial capabilities regarding Travel Management operations and sustainment.  The Department of Defense (DoD) does not intend to award any type of award instrument based on responses to this RFI, or otherwise provide compensation for the information solicited.  Any information submitted in response to this RFI is provided voluntaril y.  Respondents are advised that PMO-DTS is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this Request for Information (RFI). This RFI is open to all sources and qualified small businesses are encouraged to participate.  Background: The Defense Travel System (DTS) is a major acquisition information system (MAIS) program with a lifecycle of 2016.  More specifically, the DTS is an electronic system that provides a capability to Department of Defense (DoD) employees in support of Tempora ry Duty (TDY) travel, enabling them to determine availability of transportation and lodging alternatives, make reservations, obtain necessary approvals and get tickets, prepare and submit vouchers, and receive reimbursement for authorized out-of-pocket exp enses.  DTS also processes financial transactions associated with travel arrangements and disbursements.  DTS is considered both a travel and a financial management system. The DTS will eventually be deployed to approximately 11,000 Department of Defense ( DoD) worldwide sites.   The Travel Management Operations and Sustainment support being required includes maintaining the gateway connections between DTS and the four primary Global Distribution Systems (GDSs). In addition to maintaining the connection, audits need to be performed  on the GDS databases to ensure that the data is correctly loaded in the GDSs as well as retrieved accurately and completely by the gateway connections to DTS. Travel Management Operations and Sustainment support could include providing Help Desk services to both Commercial Travel Offices (CTOs) and DoD users who need assistance with their travel reservations.  Recommendations for system improvements and/or enhancements related to travel functionality would be provided monthly to the Government through docu mented change requests.  Once approved, the changes will be forwarded to the prime contractor for implementation. The effort may also include an interface to Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) to retrieve travel reservation data for business intelligence , in order that a comparison of the travel data from ARC to the DTS travel reservation data can be performed, along with the conduct of data mining services.  DoD intends to use a rules driven tool, called OpenJaw, to interface with the Global Distribution Systems (GDSs). OpenJaw includes a component called the reservation gateway that is responsible for providing travel information, needed for booking and ticke ting. Below is additional information about this tool including a top level diagram.  The OpenJaw application uses XML documents instead of code to drive the logic.  The format of the XML documents is defined externally in XML Schema Definition (XSD) files and can be the message definitions from standards bodies such as the OpenTravel" All iance or Travel Technology Initiative. The addition of new data items to the XML documents does not break the component or interface definitions and therefore allows the changed data to be passed through without any software changes.  A sophisticated Business Rules Engine allows business logic changes to be easily im plemented without programming changes. The Business Rules Engine allows business rules to be built using data in the XML message (again based on the XSD definition file) and other external data sources. An example of a rule would be: Rules editing is accomplished through a web based interface as described here: The rules editor allows non-technical business experts to build rules using a simple point-and-click 'pseudo English' interface. These are then dynamically applied to the running system. The XML message is represented as a tree-structure, built from the XML Schema or DTD (Data Type Definition). The user identifies data elements, which may be of interest when building rules, and assigns them a descriptive name. The Rule Building screen allo ws design and management of rules using an easy point-and-click interface. The message elements and sections identified at the 'Data Identification' stage are presented to the user along with:  ∑	Operators (AND, OR, 'is greater than', 'multiplied by' etc.)  ∑	Rule management functions ('New Rule', 'Clear Rule' etc.)  ∑	Links to external data sources.  Rules are built by clicking the appropriate display items to build the rule syntax in the editor screen. The process is intuitive and typically takes minutes for a new user to learn. Through this interface, the user can also enable, disable or delete exist ing rules. The DTS System Overview Diagram is attached for additional information. The responses to the RFI are requested not later than 5:00 PM February 12, 2006.  All interested parties who intend to submit a proposal in response to any resulting Request for Proposal (RFP) as a prime contractor, team, or potential subcontractor are strongly encouraged to submit a response to this RFI.  All RFI elements identified at  Sections 1, 2, 3, & 4 should be addressed to the maximum extent possible and in a format consistent with the format established in this RFI. The PMO-DTS will hold optional meetings with interested companies who would like to present their written response document to the Government. The Government will not be providing information during the sessions and no discussions will take place. The Gove rnment will be in a receiving mode for information the contractors have directly related to their written submission. The contractor is asked to follow the written format for their oral presentation of the data. The Government requests that the contractors  refrain from marketing their company during the oral presentation but rather provide their recommendations on the topics within this RFI. Meetings will be held in 90 minute increments on the following days:   -	Tuesday February 14, 2006 (1-2:30 and 3-4:30) -	Thursday February 16, 2006 (1-2:30 and 3-4:30) -	Friday February 17, 2006 (9-10:30 and 11-12:30) -	Tuesday February 21, 2006 (1-2:30 and 3-4:30) -	Thursday February 23, 2006 (1-2:30 and 3-4:30) -	Friday February 24, 2006 (9-10:30 and 11-12:30) Meeting Location:  Program Management Office - Defense Travel System 241 18th Street Suite 100 Arlington, VA 22202 Meetings can be scheduled through the http://www.dtstravelcenter.dod.mil/dtsrfi/ website. These meetings are first come, first serve.  If we have not received your written response to this RFI by 5:00 PM on February 12, 2006, your meeting will automaticall y be cancelled. Meetings that are cancelled will be offered to companies that submit a written response but were unable to secure a presentation appointment.

Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (JAN 2005) The offeror must complete the annual representations and certifications electronically via the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov. After reviewing the ORCA database information, the offeror verifies by submission of this offer that the representations and certifications currently posted electronically at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, have been entered or updated in the last 12 months, are current, accurate, complete, and applicable to this solicitation (including business size standard applicable to the NAICS code referenced for this solicitation), as of the date of this offer and are incorporated in this offer by reference (see FAR 4.1201); FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions ñ Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items As prescribed in 12.301 (c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: EVALUATIONóCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

C.  Teaming/Subcontracting Relationships.  If an Offerorís quote includes Teaming Partners or Subcontractors, then the Offeror is required to supply to the Government, along with its quote, a copy of the Teaming Arrangement or other document that identifies which partner/subcontractor shall be responsible for performing which requirements.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

1.  Past Performance and Experience.  The Government will evaluate offerorís past performance and experience to determine whether the vendor consistently delivers quality products and services in a timely manner.  This factor will be evaluated on the basis of relevant past performance and experience for each offeror. 
Each quote is required to describe a minimum of three but not more than five prior relevant projects that the offeror has completed or are ongoing which are similar in scope and size to this requirement.  Include points of contact and their phone numbers, and titles, size of procurement in dollar value and e-mail addresses if possible.  Each reference shall include a contracting and technical point of contact.  
If the offerorís quote includes teaming partners or subcontractors, then the information above required of the offeror on three to five relevant projects shall be similarly required of each teaming partner/subcontractor. 
If the offerorís quote includes teaming partners or subcontractors, then the Government shall evaluate each partnerís/subcontractorís individual past performance and experience and average the evaluations together for an overall Team past performance and experience evaluation.  In evaluating a teaming partnerís or subcontractorís past performance in a particular type of work, the Government may consider whether the teaming partner whose past performance or experience is touted will be performing that work, as evidenced by the terms of the quote and the Teaming Arrangement or other document provided per paragraph C above.
The information presented in the vendorís quote, together with information from any other sources available to the Government (i.e., Government-controlled Contractor performance databases, Inspector General reports, General Accounting Office reports, newspaper articles, references including contractual and end-user representatives, etc.) will provide the input for evaluation of this factor.  The past performance and experience information should include the vendorís record of providing high quality services in a timely manner, standards of good workmanship, adhering to contract schedules, administrative aspects of contract performance, overall quality of assigned personnel, availability, stability, reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to and business-like concern for the interests of the customer, quality of overall program management approach, record of awards or performance recognition earned, and overall client satisfaction.  Past performance and experience that is relevant to this requirement will be of more value than non-relevant past performance and experience.  Offerors will be evaluated on examples of past performance and experience wherein the experience of the vendor has contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.  Offerors will be evaluated on examples of past performance and experience wherein the infrastructure and resources of the vendor contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.  A lack of relevant past performance and experience data will be treated by the Government as a neutral evaluation.  Past performance and experience will be evaluated to determine contractorís suitability for meeting the objectives of the requirement.

If the contractor believes that there are excusable circumstances, the contractor shall inform the COTR/COR or Contracting Officer.  Excusable circumstances may result in adjustment of the consequences mentioned in this para graph.  This paragraph does not invalidate any of the usual rights allowed by the Inspection of Services clause.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to extend the current contract 500-01-0007 with VIPS for VMS Maintenance for 10 months.  The first month is for post production support of the October quarterly Release and the remaining nine months is for a transition period in the event that ViPS is not selected (CMS will compete the continuation of the services) to continue providing VMS maintenance.  This is not a solicitation.  This is a notice of our intent to contract with ViPS.  CMS is using the exception to full and open competition described in FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(b) to procure ViPS's services.  This exception to full and open competition allows the Government to contract with the original contractor for follow-on services.  The VMS system is proprietary system developed and maintained by ViPS.  This systems has never been transition and, therefore ViPS is the only source for providing post production and transition services at this time.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition citing the authority provided by FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(b) has been prepared.    Interested parties must submit complete cost and technical information by the response date established above.  Email or fax responses are not acceptable.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be reviewed solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement, which is extremely unlikely considering that this non-competitive action is being executed to permit time to complete a competitive procurement for the continuation of the required maintenance services.  See Note 22.  Direct questions to Lyandra Emmanuel at Lyandra.Emmanuel@cms.hhs.gov

Security Provision:

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

Compliance with the Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS201)  entitled ìPersonal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors,î Phase I.

1.	Long-Term Contractor Personnel:

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term  contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005.

a.	Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, ìEmployment Eligibility Verification,î and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal governmental-issued picture ID);

b.	Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents.  This identity proofing must be complete sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c.	Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.  Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:

ï	High Risk ñ Background Investigation (5year scope)
ï	Moderate Risk ñ Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
ï	Low Risk ñ National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation.

d.	The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:

1)	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form:
2)	Favorable fingerprint results:
3)	Favorable credit report, if required; 
4)	Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
5)	Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC)  portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.

	A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.

	If the NAC is not received within five (5) days of OPMís scheduling date, the badge can be issued on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results).

e.	Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated.  If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.

2.	Short-Term Contractor Personnel:

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in 1a and 1b above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:

a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form:
b.	Favorable fingerprint results:
c.	Favorable credit report, if required; 
d.	Waiver request memorandum, indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.  

For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered ìlong-termî and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.

3.	Intermittent Contractor:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.

a.	For purposes of this policy, ìintermittentî is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.

b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Departmentís escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004 and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escort access.

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirement that apply to short-term contractors are required.

d.	In an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge.  The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.

4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJís BI requirements.

5.	The DOJís current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.

Selection criteria: Award will be made to the offeror whose quote is most advantageous to the government, considering price and technical expertise.
 
You quote shall contain a firm fixed price for the installation of integrated facility security access and property asset tracking systems.  Please identify and price each element of the requirement.  Your quote shall also contain brief information addressing your technical capability to install this system. 

All quotes shall be submitted to Miles Stroman, at the following addresses:  U.S. Department of Justice, Justice Management Division, Procurement Services Staff, Acquisitions Programs Group, 1331 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, National Place Bldg., Suite 1040, Washington, DC 20530 or miles.stroman@usdoj.gov by 2:00 pm., local time on February 17, 2006.

The equipment shall be outfitted with suitable attachments for overhead lifting. 1.1 For multiple point lifts, each lifting attachment shall be capable of supporting one-half the gross weight of the equipment with a design factor of five to one based on ultimate strength.  For single point lifts, the lifting attachment shall be capable of supporting the gross weight of the equipment with a design factor of five to one based on ultimate strength.  1.2 For multiple point lifts, each lifting attachment shall be designed to accept a standard anchor shackle (Federal Specification RR-C-271D, type IVA) which is capable of supporting one-half the gross weight of the equipment.  For single point lifts, the lifting attachment shall be designed to accept a standard anchor shackle (Federal Specification RR-C-271D, Type IVA) which is capable of supporting the gross weight of the equipment.  1.3  Design of the lifting attachments shall be such that the attachments and shackles are not side loaded more than 10 deg out of the plane.  Lifting attachments shall be located such that the lifting slings do not contact the equipment, or alternatively a spreader beam certified to NAVFAC P-307 shall be provided.  Whenever practical, the lifting attachments shall be located above the center of gravity, and such that the lifting slings do not contact the equipment housings.  1.4  Each lifting attachment shall be conspicuously marked in a contrasting color "Lift Here".  Letters shall be a minimum of 1 inch in height. 2. The equipment shall be marked in a prominent location with the gross weight.  Sand hoppers, tubs or other containers that may contain material shall be marked with the empty and full weight (or alternatively the empty weight and working load limit).  Marking shall be upper case letters of a contrasting color with a minimum height of 1 inch.  Marking shall include the units (i.e. pounds, long tons etc).  3.  The equipment shall be provided with a lifting sketch/rigging diagram that meets the requirements described herein.  3.1.  The lifting sketch shall detail any specific requirements and/or configurations that must be met prior to lifting (i.e. Engage swing lock, Tilt mast back fully, Rotate lifting basket over side, Utilize 10 ft min. length slings, Spreader beam required, etc)  3.2  The lifting sketch shall include the location of the center of gravity of the equipment (full fuel, hydraulic tanks, etc)., model/manufacturer, and gross weight.  3.3 A copy of the lifting sketch shall be permanently posted on the equipment.4.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>MOD 0001 - This amendment is issued to incorporate to answer quoter questions as follows:

1) ìCould you please give us an idea of the number of feet in the library and compact shelving that have to relocate.î     

Library:  We do not know how much of our present library will be moving with us at this time. If all of it were to move with us, then, presently, the library is in two different locations (because of the way we have had to re-claim space for offices.)  There are 4 walls of shelves, each 8 feet high, with the following lengths:  48 ft long, 20 ft long, 24 ft long and 10 ft long.   All shelves are 18 inches deep. 

Compact files: We do not know whether it would be cost effective to dismantle and reassemble the existing unit.  The unit is approx:  20 ft long, 12 ft deep and 7 ft. high. 
 
2) ìIs there an inventory list of work stations and furniture for the project?î
 
There is presently not an inventory per se.  We do not know which of our present furniture pieces will be moving with us, as the new space has been designed for systems furniture, and we have traditional wood furniture. We are assuming that much of our furniture will be new.  

For discussion purposes, I can outline for you the following furniture pieces that are presently in our space:  Most staff, (135) whether line staff or managers, have a desk and/or credenza , task chair, guest chair, bookcase(s) and 1-3 vertical file cabinets.  Senior managers (8) have a table with 6 chairs in addition. Non-senior managers have 2-3 more guest chairs.  There are 3-4 areas with anywhere from 6-10 lateral file cabinets.  The District Administrator has a number of additional pieces, such as a couch and side tables and a couple more bookcases.  

II. Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions of the subject solicitation, remain unchanged.
