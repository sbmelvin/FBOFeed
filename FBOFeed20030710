<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration,(SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Service (CMHS) through the Program Support Center (PSC) plans to award a sole source simplified acquisition entitled “Psychotropic Drugs and MH Services in Employer-based Health Plans” to The MEDSTAT Group, Market Scan Division,777 East Eisenhower Pkwy, Ann Arber, MI 48101.  The period of performance is sixteen months from date of award.  With the national shift to managed care delivery systems, SAMHSA is focusing resources to work with States, counties, community providers, family members and consumers to ensure effective, comprehensive and nondiscriminatory mental health and substance abuse managed care services. Two analyses will be conducted under this acquisition.  Both of the projects will use recent information derived from the Contractor database, created and maintained by the Contractor. In both projects the Contractor shall assess the MarketScan database and shall develop algorithms for identifying Mental Health users, providers, and psychotropic medications as required by the project. The analysis will examine: the types of providers prescribing the medications; the nature of the medications prescribed, including the frequency of the claims for medication for various groups of individuals; the diagnoses and other characteristics of persons receiving various types of medications; utilization rates for these individuals for other types of medical and surgical services; and average expenditures per individual for psychotropic medication and for other types of medical and mental health services. The second analysis will focus on an analysis of the frequency with which various mental health services and psychotropic medication are provided on preschool children, ages 0-6 years; or an analysis of service utilization patterns and use of psychotropic medication by children whose diagnoses are consistent with serious emotional disturbances (SED), as well as by adults with diagnoses or other indicators of serous mental illness (SMI); and an analysis of the mental health service patterns and utilization of psychotropic medications by those children, adolescents, and adults who are the most intensive users of mental health services.  The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 12 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No Solicitation is available.  For further information, please contact Julia Savoy in Rm 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane Rockville, Maryland 20857, or on 301-443-1386 or by e-mail jsavoy@psc.gov reference no. 03M000188.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT WANTS TO LEASE SPACE IN
CONWAY, ARKANSAS   SFO  1AR0116
REQUIREMENT:

LEASE TERM:  15 years - 10 years firm.

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:
The Government requires a fully serviced lease including 19 parking spaces on site.  Separate employee and visitor parking and provisions for green space are required.  In accordance with special security regulations, the building is required to have a 50 foot setback from all potential points of explosion.  Office space must be contiguous and on one level without being split by a public corridor.  First floor space is required. Space offered must have potential for efficient layout; columns must be at least 25 ft. apart center to center; space should not be “U” or “L” shaped or exceed a length to width ratio of 3:2.

LOCATION:
The Government desires that a new building be constructed on a site located at Nutters Chapel Road south of Dave Ward Drive and immediately south of the Conway Regional Medical Office Park, containing approximately 1.73 acres (75,359 sf) in Conway, AR.  The Government holds an assignable option for the land.  At lease award, successful offeror will purchase land from land owner for a price of $376,795.  The Government has completed a Phase 1 Environmental Assessment of the site, and a determination has been made that no further environmental review is required.

<DESC>USAID/Dominican Republic’s 2002-2007 Country Strategy for Education counts on private sector contributions towards the improvement of Basic Education in public schools.  The ultimate goal of the strategy is to promote an increase in the quantity and quality of interactions among the school, its surrounding community, and local/national organizations interested in the educational process.  The full impact of USAID programs in public schools can only be determined through a careful monitoring and evaluation plan that will track differences in learning in that student population benefiting from such programs.

The USAID/DR Mission would like to receive proposals from qualified organizations in response to the need for a Monitoring and Evaluation system for selected schools that should include, but not be limited to: 

·	educational testing to determine changes in learning outcomes;
·	evaluations of substantive community involvement in school-related activities;
·	application of survey instruments for opportunities to learn;
·	on-going assessments of the policy environment directly conducive to enhanced private sector involvement in public education; and
·	active collaboration in monitoring and evaluation between the Ministry of Education and private institutions involved in education.

<DESC>This procurement is unrestricted for a Design-Build Project being acquired through the use of the two phase selection process. The procurement will be conducted using source selection procedures and the award will be based on the best value to the government considering the price and non-priced factors, which are cited in this announcement and the solicitation. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Test & Support Facilities (Project number-129) at the Naval Air Warfare Center, Patuxent River, MD will provide a proposed maximum 6,615 gross square meters (71,203 sq. ft.) to be comprised of two buildings that are state of the art engineering offices, labs and data processing areas to support the Joint Strike Fighter Program. 

The Joint Strike Fighter project for the Patuxent River NAS (Naval Air Test Center), will encompass a new testing and support facility. The project consists of two separate structures. Building 1 is a multistory R&D engineering office & lab with administrative, meeting/briefing and data processing areas. Building 2 is to include a high bay engine maintenance area with full coverage bridge crane and engineering space. All buildings will be designed to current force protection and standoff requirements. Site and landscape design must be developed to incorporate these standards and may be utilized to limit the exposure of the facilities to potential hazards.

Included in this project is the demolition of several buildings located on the base. It is believed that these facilities contain both lead paint and asbestos. The Statement of Work includes specific information for the removal and demolition of facilities containing these materials. The site shall be cleared and repaired with non-contaminated soils and sod or landscaping. 
Additionally, an existing hangar shall receive renovations on the first and second floors. The design/build budget at this time is approximately $20 million. 

Phase I of this acquisition will evaluate offerors considering Past Performance and the following factors: Technical Factor 1 Relevant Construction Experience, Technical Factor 2 – Design/Build Team Capabilites, Technical Factor 3 – Working Relationships Between The A-E And The Contractor - Technical Factor 4- Bonding Capability/Corporate Resources, and Technical Factor 5 – Safety. Potential offerors are notified that the Government expects no greater than five offerors will be invited to participate in Phase II and anticipates a sufficient number of competitors to be three. Offerors invited to participate in Phase II of this acquisition process will be evaluated on Price and the following additional factors: Technical Factor 6 – Project Schedule, and Technical Factor 7 – Small Business Subcontracting Effort and Price. The detailed description of this criteria and submission requirements will be included in the solicitation issued under Phase II. Offerors are advised that the combined Technical Factors are considered approximately equal in importance to Price and Past Performance in the selection of the Best Value offeror. All technical factors in Phase I and Phase II are considered equal in importance to each other. Each offeror will receive an evaluation rating for their response to the Phase I criteria. A final evaluation rating will be assigned to each offeror invited to participate in Phase II, at the conclusion of the Phase II evaluation that will take into consideration the rating assigned under Phase I. Offerors proposing as a joint venture shall ensure that complete information required for evaluation is provided for both entities in the partnership. 

Interested offerors shall submit responses to Phase I based on the following: 

Technical Factor 1  - Relevant Construction Experience

Offerors shall provide a maximum of five projects constructed within the last 7 years that demonstrate relevant experience consisting of the following elements:

(1)	Design/Build (Identify designer)
(2)	Large construction projects on or adjacent to active military airfields and/or FAA commercial airfield environments. 
(3)	Similar construction to:
a.	aircraft engine maintenance high bay structures
b.	SCIF Labs and/or office buildings
c.	high voltage electrical distribution for aircraft servicing.

Each project submitted need not include all of the elements above. Offerors should provide a brief description of the work performed for each contract referenced and explain how it is similar in scope, size, function and complexity to the subject project. For each project the offeror shall provide the following information:

-	Project Title
-	Contract Number & Type (i.e., fixed price, cost)
-	Customer
-	Original Award Amount
-	Final Amount
-	Award Date
-	Original Completion Date
-	Final Completion Date

Offerors demonstrating projects consisting of a greater number of the above criteria may receive a more favorable rating for this factor.

Technical Factor 2 – Design/Build Team Capabilities

Design

The offeror shall identify the designer for this project and submit Forms 254 and 255 for their design partner for evaluation.  The offeror shall identify the designer’s key positions that will be dedicated to this project. The Government will determine whether the designer possesses adequate expertise on projects similar in size, scope, complexity and dollar value to that which is required by this RFP. 

Construction

Key positions include the project manager, superintendent, quality control manager and safety manager. The Government recognizes that the offeror may not have individuals assigned to this project by the submission date of proposals and therefore we are seeking to understand the qualifications and degree of experience you require of individuals fulfilling these key positions.

Technical Factor 3 – Working Relationships Between The A-E And The Contractor 

In relation to this project, describe the A-E’s involvement in the construction phase and the Contractor’s involvement during the design phase.  Describe how the design-build team will function as a whole and what benefits the proposed team will bring to the success of this project.  Also, describe how Quality Control will be integrated into your proposed teaming approach.  Quotes that provide a seamless, cohesive team, both during the design and construction phases of work, will receive a higher rating.

Technical Factor 4  - Bonding Capability/Corporate Resources	

The offeror shall provide information on bonding capabilities to include single project limit, available capacity and the surety’s name, point of contact and phone number (e-mail addresses if available) and/or corporate resources (i.e. lines of credit) to show ability to finance a project of this magnitude.

Technical Factor 5 – Safety

The offeror shall provide the following information:

·	Submit insurance company Experience Modification Rate (EMR) for previous five years.
·	Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) Lost Work Day Incident Rate for the past five years.
·	Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) Recordable Incident Rate for the past five years.
·	Submit Federal, State, and Municipal OSHA citations for the past five years.

Offerors demonstrating a consistent record of good safety will receive a more favorable rating for this factor. The number of incidents alone will not determine the rating. Severity will be evaluated.
       
PAST PERFORMANCE

Past Performance information is one indicator of an offeror’s ability to perform this contract successfully. The currency and relevancy of the information, source of information, context of data, and general trends in contractor’s performance shall be taken into consideration. The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror to the other competitors and establish a level of confidence or risk for successful performance under this contract. Past Performance findings will influence the relative standing of the offeror. Findings will be used to validate proposals against established evaluation criteria.

Utilizing the reference information provided under Factor 1, the Government will evaluate the contractor’s past performance on similar projects. Offerors are authorized to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective actions taken. In investigating the offerors’s past performance, the Government is not limited to the references submitted but may rely on other sources as well.

Evaluation of Past Performance will be a subjective assessment. The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services as fair and reasonable pricing. The Government will evaluate the offeror’s record of conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship, and will evaluate the offeror’s record on cost control/change orders and adherence to contract schedules. Subcontractor management, safety management and other quality control programs will also be reviewed. The Government will examine the offeror’s record for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and in general, the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the offeror’s response will be taken into consideration.

Past Performance questionnaires shall be obtained by the offeror through the NAVFAC E-Solicitation Web (e-sol website) at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil

In response to Past Performance the offeror is requested to submit five past performance surveys (Past Performance surveys shall be sent to the offerors references and shall be sent back to the offeror in a sealed envelope and signed across the seal and submitted with the other Phase I information). Additionally, a review of ACASS/CCASS will be performed and evaluated for offerors with past Government experience.

Responses to Phase I shall be submitted in an original and five copies and are due at the office of Engineering Field Activity Chesapeake, 1314 Harwood Street, SE, Building 212, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20374. Submission must be delivered to the mailroom on the first floor, date stamped and placed in the bid box. Submissions are due by 10:00 am EST on 11 August 2003. Notification of the Governments’ decision of whether an offeror is or is not invited to participate in Phase II will be promptly provided to all firms submitting a response to this announcement. Those firms selected to participate in Phase II will be provided the solicitation package, invited to attend a pre-proposal conference/site visit and will submit proposals responding to the criteria set forth in the solicitation. The Government reserves the right, and the solicitation may require, oral presentation by each offeror under Phase II of this acquisition process. It is anticipated that award of a contract will occur in November 2003.

All attachments to be filled out and submitted under Phase I can be obtained through the NAVFAC E-Solicitation Web (e-sol website) at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil

<DESC>The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) intends to award a sole source procurement to McCreight and Company.  NIMA has a need to procure consulting services in support of the newly formed NIMA Strategic Transformation Office (STO).  The purpose of this effort is to gain the expertise of commercial industry in the areas of organizational strategy development and implementation.  Work will include consulting services to complete the development of NIMA’s Corporate Strategy, Enterprise Operating Framework, and a Strategy Implementation Timeline and Action Plan.  
McCreight is the only source that can perform these services due to their knowledge of NIMA’s Strategic Intent, previous transformation plans and initiatives such as the Corporate Transformation Business Plan, and the results of the NIMA Transformation Report produced by the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSGI) Enterprise Transformation Product Team (NETIPT), which was chartered in May 2002.  Further, due to previous work performed by McCreight and Company in support of the STO they possess current knowledge of NIMA’s mission, functions, business strategies, current operating construct, and understand the organization’s role with the Intelligence Community (IC) and Department of Defense.  Having any other vendor perform these services would cause a delay of approximately six months to the government for the new contractor to develop the technical expertise comparable to McCreight and Company.
This is a synopsis of intent to award a firm fixed price contract under FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items. The authority for sole source procurement is FAR 6.302-1(a), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Responsible sources that are interested in this procurement may respond by providing clear and convincing information that identifies their ability to provide the product. All responses must be e-mailed to the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, Attn:  Christina Stans, stanscc@nima.mil by 2:00 P.M., EST, 25 July 2003. It is the responsibility of the sender to confirm if e-mails have been received.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-03-00283, and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal  Acquisition Circular 01-14.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $6.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.   This procurement is for  the analysis of total nitrogen and total phosphate in estuarine/marine water samples.  A minimum of one thousand (1,000) samples will be guaranteed, with a maximum of up to 3,500 samples provided for analysis.  The number of samples above the guaranteed minimum of 1,000  are optional. The Government may exercise its unilateral right to purchase up to an additional 2,500 samples for a maximum total of 3,500 samples.  The period of performance for this sample analysis will be from the date of award through December 31, 2005.  The contractor shall provide a price per  sample to include all costs associated with performing the analysis.  The contractor is required to submit a copy of the Quality Assurance/Quality Control protocols to the EPA prior to the analysis of the samples.  These protocols shall be the same as, or exceed those described below.  The  contractor shall agree to allow a QA audit of laboratory and/or data entry procedures by an authorized agent of the EPA at any time (with advance notice).  The contractor  shall transfer copies of all technical, fiscal, and programmatic files regarding this contract to the Project Officer.  These  files shall be boxed in accordance with Federal Record Keeping Standards in boxes required by the Records Center and labeled as "Nutrient Team Research- Contractor Name / Contract Number" and contain an internal and external packing slip that identifies the specific contents of each box.  The  external packing slip shall be affixed to the exterior of the box.  To ensure comparable data of acceptable quality, EPA requires that all participating laboratories meet or exceed the following conditions and performance standards for the analyses of interest, whether conducted in-house or by a  contract laboratory.  The methods described here are based on established analytical procedures that are generally accepted and utilized in environmental studies.  EPA acknowledges there have been advances in state-of-the-art for some of the methods; therefore, in keeping with a performance-based  approach to QA/QC,  laboratories are encouraged to use their best available technology.  However, prior to approval,  proposed modifications or alternative methods shall first be review by EPA to ensure that the program's quality standards are met.   Required Methods and Quality Assurance Criteria  for the Laboratory Determinations of Total Nitrogen and Total Phosphorus.  Total nitrogen and total phosphorus shall be analyzed using automated colorimetric methods for the determination of total N and total P, after persulfate digestion.  Analyses shall be conducted using an autoanalyzer (e.g.,  Technicon AutoAnalyzer, or similar); the use of an autoanalyzer is required to process samples in an expeditious manner.  Instrument calibrations shall be based on a 5-point standard curve for each nutrient analyte; calibration standards should bracket the concentration ranges of the field samples.   Samples shall be analyzed in batches consisting of 10-15 field samples per batch along with the following required QC check samples:  Laboratory blank;  Spike/recovery check sample; and Duplicate sample.  Because the estuarine/marine nutrient samples will span a wide range of salinities, it may  be necessary to group field samples into general categories of salinity (e.g., 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, etc) and analyze the various groups of samples against standards prepared with water of corresponding salinity (matrix match). Reporting units shall be in uM; samples shall be identified to the site by  using the station site ID code; all samples shall link to a designated batch; final data reports shall be submitted both electronically (asci delimited) and in hardcopy format.  Data reports shall be received no later than 60 days from receipt of samples.  The basic QA/QC requirements for the  analyses of total N and total P include the following: Method Detection Limits (MDLs) - 0.5 uM for N; 0.05 uM for P; Calibration curve - correlation coefficient of  0.99 (r2); Percent Spike Recovery -  ? 10% of true standard value ( i.e., 90 - 110% recovery); Duplicate Analysis - Relative percent  difference (RPD) of 30%.  The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. Evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES  CRITERIA: 1) Provide a copy of QA/QC protocols including plans for replication analysis; 2) Demonstrate previous experience with estuarine nutrient samples; 3) Demonstrate previous analytical experience with NS&T, EMAP or similar monitoring programs;  4) Brief explanation of methods used for each  analysis with references;  5) Experience with similar size/scope projects;  6) Ability to meet the deadlines for the project;  7) Plan to submit a final report (electronic format) as required;  and 8) Describe Record Management Program.  (ii) PAST PERFORMANCE:  Provide 3 references (quality of  product or service, timeliness of performance, ability to adhere to deadlines, and overall customer  satisfaction); and (iii) PRICE.  Price will be evaluated inclusive of optional quantities.  Award will be made to the offeror whose offer is determined the lowest priced, technically acceptable  offer.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Data Procurement Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Dr. Vahe Gurzadyan, Armenian Space Research Center, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, gurzadya@icra.it  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for determining the technical, financial, and economic feasibility of implementing a satellite earth station and ultraviolet space telescope.

The project is to be developed in two phases:  the first will entail the construction and operation of a satellite receiving and control station, which would operate on a commercial basis; and the second will involve the design, development, installation, and operation of a space ultraviolet telescope, which will be operated either as payload on the international space station, or as a separate module.  One of the key goals of this second phase of the project is to produce an Ultraviolet Sky Atlas, which would be a major contribution to the field of modern astrophysics.  

The project, which will have both commercial and scientific uses, will capitalize on Armenia's technological strengths, and will have the added value of stemming the brain drain of Armenian scientists.  The astrophysics domain, of which this project is part, is particularly sensitive due to possible defense and intelligence applications.

The terms of reference for the feasibility study include the following:

·	Define product/service portfolio
·	Conduct a detailed market assessment
·	Perform requirements analysis and evaluate prospective satellite equipment providers and CACSD software developers
·	Define satellite network and interconnection topology, and layout of control and CACSD/engineering facilities
·	Prepare Environmental Assessment
·	Develop a procurement and implementation plan	
·	Conduct financial analysis, projections, and budgeting
·	Develop a high-level business/operational plan (Strategic Plan)
·	Prepare Final Report		


The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a USD275,980 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and excerpts from a background definitional mission report, are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English to the Grantee care of USTDA by 12:00 noon on August 15, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Pearson Engineering, Ltd. (PEL), Wincomblee Road, Walker, New Castle upon Tyne, NE6 3QS, England to acquire High Lift Adapter (HLA) kits. The HLA kit is used in conjunction with the Full Width Mine Plow (FWMP), Surface Mine Plow (SMP), and Dozer Blade (DB). The HLA kit allows the FWMP, SMP, and DB to be raised to the high lift position. The reason justifying this sole source procurement is that the FWMP, SMP, and DB are currently used by the USMC and manufactured by PEL. The HLA kit required for the FWMP, SMP, and DB is only manufactured by PEL. To manufacture such a kit requires detailed design information of these three components, which is PEL proprietary information. Government attempts to purchase an HLA kit from other sources would require significant development and testing costs, including schedule delays of up to a year. In order to minimize cost, ensure interoperability among the FWMP, SMP, and DB, and improve supportability, it is necessary to purchase the HLA kits from PEL. There is NO solicitation document. This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Interested firms may send capability statements to COMMANDING GENERAL, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN: Code CTQ5GTC, Capt. G.T. Carroll, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA, 22314-5010.  Note 22 applies; however, 45 days is changed to read 15 days.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The new IEP will build on the lessons learned and best practices developed over the course of the program, namely, (i) use of a holistic approach to school development, especially governance which must involve communities; (ii) emphasis on leadership development at both school and district levels; and (iii) provision of support to clusters of schools, rather than individual schools. Under the anticipated contract, the contractor will be expected to contribute to the achievement of the following key objectives in order to assist USAID/South Africa to attain the result of “improved quality of primary education,” with a specific focus on improving the system’s capacity to deliver quality math and science programs. Those objectives are:  (i) enhanced capacity of teachers (targeted to the teaching of literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science; (ii) effective implementation of Curriculum 2005 (C2005), with a focus on literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science curriculum; and (iii) improved educational management and enhanced school governance. The stated objectives are consistent with the National Department of Education (NDoE) and those of other local and international development partners. USAID/South Africa anticipates awarding one performanced based contract for a three year period using full and open competition. The government estimate is $16.3m with an optional 4th year for an additional amount of $6.6m. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Government-wide point of entry (GPE). This pre-solicitation notice can be viewed and downloaded using http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The solicitation, once issued, can be downloaded from the GPE.

<DESC>This AMENDED Pre-Solicitation Notice is issued for the purpose of telling prospective offerors that the INCUMBENT contractor could NOT be proposed to serve as the PRIME contractor for this Community Website project, but that the incumbent COULD be proposed to serve as a SUBcontractor for this Community Website project----provided that at least 51% of the Community Website project's total loaded labor dollars are associated NOT with the incumbent but instead with the small-business PRIME contractor.   In other words, a small business company meeting this procurement's small business size standard could propose itself as the PRIME contractor, and could propose to have the incumbent serve as a SUBcontractor performing not more than 49% of the project's total loaded labor cost.   The incumbent contractor----that is, the company that has previously performed research work related to this Community Website project----is:TML Information Services, Inc., located at 116-55 Queens Boulevard, Forest Hills, NY 11375; and TML's contact person is Sean Dougherty at telephone number (800) 743-7891.  The FHWA does hope to publish----as an attachment to the Solicitation (RFP) hereafter issued----a copy of a relevant background REPORT produced by TML in November of 2001, entitled "Mexico vis a vis International Registration Plan (IRP)/International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA)".  To the best of the FHWA's knowledge, that background report is NOT now available on-line, at any web site or Internet address.  The FHWA is NOT in a position to release that background report NOW, because it is too LENGTHY to fit within the space constraints imposed on a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ACCEPT TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, LETTER-WRITTEN, OR FAXED REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION (RFP) FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.   Instead, all prospective offerors must retrieve the solicitation from this FedBizOpps web site, when the solicitation is hereafter published.  This is a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE procurement.  Under this procurement, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a CONTRACT under which the contractor will provide assistance to develop a community website for the FHWA’s Truck Size & Weight Program activities.  It is anticipated that the website will AUTOMATE the entire process by which:  (a) states certify that they are complying with STATE laws relating to the size and weight of trucks; and (b) the FHWA certifies that states are complying with FEDERAL requirements.   The contractor will:  provide for website user authentication and authorization via user IDs and passwords; create a reference library that includes documents associated with the truck size and weight program; create on-going opinion polls to gather stakeholder information and provide feedback to stakeholders; create a website discussion room on various topics of interest to stakeholders; track visitors to the website, by member name, and provide information on recent visitors to new visitors; create and maintain a What’s New section in the website; create and maintain a Contributions section in the website; create a Noteboard tool for announcements and informal discussion; create a Lists tool and Calendars in the website; create an Images sharing tool, a Files tool, a Chat tool, a Community Messenger tool, a Member List tool, an Invite Others tool, a Feedback tool, and a Preferences tool; create a Membership Groups and Permissions feature, a Polling feature, a New or Unread Indicator feature, a User Interface feature, a Community Explorer tool, a Full Text Search feature, a Related Content feature, an Optional Community Previewing feature, a Full Content Moderation tool, an Improved Community Affiliation feature; ensure that adequate Physical Security is provided for the website’s hosting facility; provide for a multi-tier System Architecture that ensures that database, file and application servers are never communicating directly with end-users; create Hardware Redundancy by utilizing multiple servers for the website; create Data Backup and Recovery features; provide for Secure Communications during all communications with the Community website; provide for Data Storage; determine, with the FHWA, which states may be selected as pilot states; manage access to the website by all authorized users; continue to support the website for three years after its development has been completed; provide training manuals for access to and use of the website; provide hands-on training to states and to the U. S. Department of Transportation, upon request; scan into the system each state’s Certification and State Enforcement Plans for the past three years; and scan letters, regulatory guidance, interpretation and other documents the FHWA deems relevant to the website.   To be competitive, an offeror’s proposal will probably need to:  (a) demonstrate that the offeror possesses in-depth technical experience in the design, implementation, management and support of a secure community website; (b) demonstrate that the offeror possesses competence in technical writing with special emphasis on the preparation of requirements and documentation including software and user manuals; (c) demonstrate that the offeror possesses knowledge of the FHWA’s Size & Weight regulatory requirements and how they can be enforced through the operation of the website.  THE DUE DATE FOR THE FHWA’S RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS, AS PUBLISHED IN THIS SYNOPSIS, IS ONLY AN ESTIMATED DUE DATE.  THE ACTUAL DUE DATE FOR THE FHWA’S RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS WILL BE STATED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SOLICITATION (RFP) HEREAFTER PUBLISHED.  The FHWA’s best current ESTIMATE is that the solicitation MIGHT be published in this FedBizOpps web site on or about July 31, 2003.   Any prospective offeror who retrieves the solicitation must be sure to frequently RE-CHECK FedBizOpps for any AMENDMENTS to the solicitation.  Re-checking for such amendments is IMPERATIVE, because amendments usually contain crucial information.

<DESC>This is the second of two announcements, the first of which was posted on June 24, 2003. This announcement serves two purposes. First, it notifies potential offerors that this study is being conducted in accordance with the revised OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003. Second, this study is subject to the Brooks Act and the procedures in FAR Subpart 36.6. USDA-NRCS seeks qualified A&E firms to provide soil conservation technical services in Louisiana. NRCS plans to utilize the A&E selection process to negotiate a fair and reasonable price with the top ranked firm(s) and make a comparison with the Government's in-house cost estimate. A contract will only result if the cost of the A&E firm is more advantageous to the Government. Government personnel currently perform the services being studied. Major components of this work include: preparing and assisting in the preparation of formal conservation plans; preparing contracts for program funding, contract modifications, contract payment applications, and supporting documentation; performing conservation practice field investigations, surveys, design, construction layout, and final inspection of practice installation; documenting practice application according to policy and procedure; and coordinating activities with other federal, state, and local units of government and private groups and organizations. The applicable NAICS code is 541990. Any contract resulting from this solicitation will have a one-year base period and four one-year options. This solicitation is unrestricted. The U.S. Government reserves the right to retain the work in-house and make no contract award.

Section C – Statement of Work 

The Government submits this Statement of Work as a Performance Based Service Contract Work Statement for Graphic Design and Editing Services.

C.1 	BACKGROUND, INTENTION and PURPOSE. 

Statement of Work

General Information

Introduction

The Department of Commerce (DoC) Office of Budget (OB) produces three key documents for distribution of budget and planning information to Congress, other Federal agencies, and the private sector:  the strategic plan, the Performance and Accountability Report (PAR) and the Budget in Brief (BIB).  Each of these documents require outside assistance in the form of design, layout/production and editing.  This statement of work is for the design, layout , production and editing of two of these documents, the strategic plan and the PAR.

Background

Strategic Plan

The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) mandates that each Federal agency develop a Strategic Plan.    

OB works with representatives of each Departmental bureau to provide the text, tables and potential graphics for this document.   OB works with the bureaus to ensure that each bureau provides an accurate depiction of the bureau’s activities and contributions in the context of the broader Departmental mission and its corresponding strategic goals and objectives.  Using a Microsoft platform, OB initially distributes Microsoft Word based templates and distributes them to bureau staff.  Bureau staff verify and provide text.  OB staff then reviews this information and then with the bureau staff resolves any textual problems that may result from Secretarial guidance or other sources.  The end result is a draft strategic plan that is further refined after comments are received from the Office of Management and Budget and other stakeholders.  

After all comments are received the Strategic Plan is sent to Congress in September.       

FY 2003 Performance and Accountability Report (PAR)

The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires that each agency report on its performance and financial management through the Performance and Accountability Report (PAR).  This report is due to OMB and Congress in January, 2004 (though Commerce intends to complete it by December, 2003) and in November each year after that.    

For the PAR, OB works with representatives of each Departmental bureau and the Office of Financial Management (OFM) and the Office of Management and Organization (OMO) to provide the text, tables and potential graphics for these documents.   OB works with the bureaus to ensure that each bureau provides an accurate depiction of the bureau’s activities particularly with regard to the performance of the bureau.  Using a Microsoft platform, OB initially distributes Microsoft Word based templates and distributes them to bureau staff.  Bureau staff enters text and numerical data.  OB staff then reviews this information and then with the bureau staff resolves any numerical or textual problems that may result from Secretarial guidance or other sources.  The end result is a completed chapter for each bureau that OB staff then combines along with summary DoC information (including appendices) into a final DoC document.  OB then combines this section with a financial management section prepared by the Office of Financial Management (OFM) and a management discussion and analysis section prepared by the Office of Management and Organization (OMO).

Scope

Since the goal of these projects is the production of a highly polished, strong depiction of Departmental plans and programs, it is the role of OB staff to work with the bureaus on the content of the documents.  Current staff resources do not allow for adequate work in the areas of design and production.  Thus, the overall purpose of this task is to provide design, layout / production and editing services for this document.  In determining this contract, the contractor shall provide separate estimates for each of the parts of this task as specified in the Work Requirements section of this statement of work.

Applicable Documents

Applicable documents for this task include:
The FY 2000-2005 Strategic Plan which is available electronically at http://www.osec.doc.gov/bmi/budget/StrategicPlan.pdf
The FY 2002 Performance and Accountability Report which is available electronically at http://www.osec.doc.gov/bmi/budget/02commercereport.htm 

Any potential contractors can view these documents for an idea of how the finalized product should appear.

Work Requirements

Technical Requirements

The contract involves the following tasks:

Initial Meetings / Communications

The contractor shall initially meet with OB staff to coordinate an exact work / production process including interim and final production dates.  This meeting will include members from the Departmental printing staff to ensure that the final product produced by the contractor can work with any printing contractors.  Once OB staff has awarded the printing contract, OB will provide the name of that contractor to this editing / design contractor.  The editing contractor will work with the printing contractor, making sure that OB staff are involved in any communications that they may have.  Throughout the course of the work the contractor shall meet with OB staff on an as needed basis.  The contractor shall arrange for or provide the necessary means to transport any materials whether electronically or in hard copy format.  In the initial meeting, OB staff will discuss basic formats, e.g., margin size, so as to facilitate layout design later in the process.  
     
Initial Design

OB staff will provide the contractor with past document showing previous cover and format designs, along with at least two cover ideas for the current documents.  These cover ideas can be broad in scope rather than detailed.  Based on past designs and contractor ideas, the contractor shall present no less than three new designs to OB staff.  Cover designs for the documents should be similar enough to indicate that it is similar to the prior documents, yet still have distinct differences, other than simply having the title different.  An example may different shading of colors for the two documents or slightly different cover pictures.  

Cover designs must be in a four-color format.  OB staff will provide the necessary text that would appear on each cover.  Interior design would be in a black and white format.  Interior design may include photographs, however, the contractor must specify what the cost would be with and without photographs.

If the initial cover designs are unacceptable, the contractor shall provide three additional choices within one week.

Layout / Production

OB will provide an initial draft of the document to the contractor, including any pictures OB may want to incorporate into the final product.  At this time, OB initially estimates that each document would have the following specifications: up to 1200 pages, 100 tables and 50 pictures.

The contractor shall then provide OB an initial layout and format design to be approved by OB along with estimates for these task based on the page estimates stated as well as estimates for page lengths being either greater or lesser.  

The contractor shall provide a design in 1 color format in a program that is easily translatable to printers and that the Office of Budget could have access to, e.g., Quark or Pagemaker.    

Scanning / Design

It may be necessary for the contractor to scan pictures into the design.  The contractor shall provide an estimate as to the cost per picture to be scanned into the document as well as the specific format that the picture that would be required from OB.  

The contractor may provide suggestions as to pictures that it has and could insert into the design.  If so, the contractor shall provide an estimate as to the cost of those pictures to OB.  Upon approval of the cost, the contractor would then incorporate those pictures into the layout.

Alterations / Corrections

Once OB has provided a final version of each document to the contractor, the contractor shall edit / proofread all text, tables and graphics.  In its response to this statement of work, the contractor shall provide an estimate as to the cost of each round of edits for each of these documents.  The following items should not be edited:

·	Mission statements,
·	Corresponding DoC Strategic Goal statement,
·	Appendix showing alphabetical list of acronyms

As part of this alteration phase, the contractor should be prepared to make final minor textual and numerical changes to both text and tables. 

Text / graphic editing (required)

Once OB has provided a final version of each document to the contractor, the contractor shall edit / proofread all text, tables and graphics.  In its response to this statement of work, the contractor shall provide an estimate as to the cost of each round of edits for each of these documents.  Nothing in the documents should be edited without the prior consent of the OB.

As part of this alteration phase, the contractor should be prepared to make final minor textual and numerical changes to both text and tables. 
  
Copy editing (optional at this point depending on cost)

The contractor shall provide copy editing estimates of each document including the amount per round.  Copy editing includes, but is not limited to, editing the content for readability and context.  Since each document has several different authors (and thus different writing styles), copy editing also includes modifying the text so that the entire document would have a uniform style.  

If OB decides to include copy editing as part of the contract, OB will provide a draft of each document at least three weeks prior to the final due date so that the contractor can proceed with initial editing.    

Website design / construction of files (optional)

The contractor shall provide an initial estimate for converting each document to: 1) a simple, web-based PDF format and, 2) a website that would meet minimum accessibility requirements of Section 508 EITAS 1194.22 to include screen reader capability.  If OB decides to proceed with this subtask, then the contractor will complete this task for each document in the immediate week after the contractor has delivered the final document to OB.  

Final meetings / follow-ups.

OB and the contractor will conduct a final follow up session to discuss what worked / didn’t work in the process.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system. The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA=92s purchasing of products. BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME. Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date. Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below. If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME. Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process. Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process. If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria. NOTE: ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED (INCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF ANY KITS) MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO). THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES. A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559. All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer's name. Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples. Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available. Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed. If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria. In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples. Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.

Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation. Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period. This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization. Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award. For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183. Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples. If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract.

<DESC>IF YOU WOULD LIKE A MORE EASILY READABLE COPY OF THIS NOTICE, PLEASE CONTACT SUE PROCTOR AT 708-786-5182 OR SUSAN.PROCTOR@MED.VA.GOV SUBJ: Sources Sought Notice for Medical/Surgical Items This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various medical/surgical items. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system. The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA's purchasing of products. BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME. Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date. Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below. If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME. Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process. Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process. If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria. NOTE: ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED (INCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF ANY KITS) MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO). THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES. A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559. All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer's name. Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples. Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available. Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed. If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria. In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples. Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent. If detailed literature or sufficient information addressing the evaluation criteria is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel will be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products will be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation. Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period. This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization. Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award. For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183. Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples. If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract. The VHA Medical/Surgical User Group, a group of VA physicians, nurses, and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted. VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts. Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable. **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Acquisition and Analysis Service (049A5S), ATTN:=20 Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL 60141** SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN JULY 25, 2003. Companies not submitting samples by this date may be eliminated from consideration on any subsequent procurement action for these items.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subject 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    This solicitation is issued as Request for Quotations 2003-C-13.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through FAR Circular number 2001-14.  This solicitation is not a small business set-aside.  I.  BACKGROUND.  The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is an independent federal agency headquartered in Chicago, IL that administers a retirement and survivor benefit program for railroad employees and their families and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act which provides unemployment and sickness benefits to railroad employees.  II. STATEMENT OF WORK.  The RRB requests quotations for the following equipment and services to accomplish upgrading our current IBM Virtual Tape Server (VTS) to add additional disaster recovery functionality.  A.  Required capabilities/performance goals.  The RRB adopted Tivoli Storage Manager as a means of backing up servers to its VTS and there has been an increasing need to upgrade the VTS to create tapes for off-site storage.  The devices currently used to copy files (mainframe and LAN) for off-site storage are old technology parallel channel connected 3490 tape drives with a tape capacity of 800 MB.  The RRB looks to upgrade the VTS by adding four 3590 tape drives within the VTS, two ESCON channels, plus other necessary support equipment.  B.  Additional RRB requirements:  1.  Equipment shall be delivered and installed at headquarters in the second floor data center at 844 N. Rush St., Chicago IL 60611.  2.  All equipment offered shall be either new or in current production by the original equipment manufacturer (if equipment is used).  3.  All equipment and installation work shall be certified by IBM as fully eligible for IBM maintenance coverage.  4.  All necessary microcode and software (if applicable) shall be supplied and installed to insure full functionality of all existing and new equipment.  5.  All necessary software updates shall be applied.  6.  The offeror shall submit evidence of the completion of a successful systems assurance review for the entire VTS upon completion of installation.  7.  Installation shall not cause any loss of data in the VTS and shall not change in any way the current processing of data into or out of the VTS.  8.  The VTS library shall have capacity for at least an additional 300 native 3590E tape cartridges.  9.  Pre-installation preparatory consulting shall be included to cover such topics as,  floor layout and electrical specifications, tape type and format, cartridge labeling, tape definition for the VTS and for CA-1 (the RRB’s tape management system), etc.  10.  Training for four operations personnel and five technical support personnel shall be provided during regular day-shift working hours.  The following topics at a minimum shall be addressed:  a. The VTS subsystem as a closed store,  b.  Operation intervention conditions and their resolution,  c.  Proper procedure for opening and closing frames, and  d.  VTS-specific Library Manager functions.  11.  Additional training for five technical support personnel on the hardware and software operation of the newly-installed equipment shall be provided during normal day-shift working hours in two stages:  a.  Training prior to beginning the VTS upgrade shall consist of;  1)  A refresher course on how the RRB’s currently configured VTS works,  2)  What changes will be made to the VTS to accommodate the additional frame, native 3590 drives, and native tapes, and  3)  How the current data in the library database will be protected (for example, backed up and restored).  b. T raining after the upgrade to the VTS is completed shall consist of;  1)  How to differentiate between the existing part of the VTS where the tapes are not removable and the new part of the VTS with the native drives and removable tapes,  2)  How to utilize the VTS console to add monitor and make changes to system settings, the tape library, etc.,  3)  How to utilize the VTS console to add new native tapes (when necessary) to the VTS and how to distinguish these tapes from ones in the part of the VTS housing non-removable tapes, 4)  How to utilize the VTS console to remove native tapes,  5)  How to utilize the VTS console to put removed native tapes back into the VTS,  6)  Software choices and how they affect the VTS subsystem, and   7)  Disaster recovery considerations.  C.  Following is a list of likely components necessary.  (These may or may not be the actual components required for the VTS upgrade described earlier)  1.  Four native 3590-B1A* drives inside the VTS (two drives per unit, four drives total),  2.  Two ESCON cables with a length of 75 feet,  3.  Two ESCON channel adapters, (ESCON channels are available on the mainframe but it its noteworthy that IBM will likely require their engineers to connect to the mainframe in order to keep their maintenance coverage in force), 4.  One 3494-D14 frame, 5.  Capacity for at least 300 native 3590E tapes,   6.  One 3590-A50** control unit, and   7.  Robot extension XY access cables if required for the 3494-L14 (serial number 13746).  * Please provide optional pricing for the same drive configuration with 3590-E1A and with 3590-H1A drives as alternatives.  ** Please provide optional pricing for one 3590-A60 control unit as an alternative to the 3590-A50.

<DESC>New McKenna MetaVR Database

Presently McKenna is using MetaVR Software version 3.9I for its 3D modeling and virtual database.  This request is for an upgrade to version 4.0.  The new software includes Ft. Benning Terrain that extends coverage of the current McKenna database to include all of Ft. Benning, GA.  Additionally, Ground textures have been replaced with aerial photography to more accurately depict the Ft. Benning area.  Because photography is used, buildings and areas on the base can still be seen from the air even though there may not be 3D data on them yet.  Included with the database will be the source files used to create it and WorldPerfect, the software tool used to create the database. WorldPerfect provides the ability to make modifications to the data and rebuild the databases.  As new terrain and building data becomes available, modifications can be made to update the database.  WorldPerfect will also provide model building capability so new buildings can be built and new vehicles (UGCV?) can be added.  Sufficient license will also be provided so that McKenna will have authority to make this data available to partners.  MetaVR will also provide updates to the database and high resolution models.  In exchange for all of this and to provide a higher fidelity/more realistic database, MetaVR is also requesting a series of specific photos of the McKenna Village, terrain and foliage information and location of the power lines and poles within the village.  This request is for one site license and the ability to reproduce run time models.

This is a sources sought notice.
Please email Linda.fox@gsa.gov for additional information.

<DESC>The National Immunization Program (NIP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is interested in receiving information on low-cost disposable technologies for the generation of medical aerosols.  Information is sought on nebulizer technologies that are available in commercial products or are in advanced development, i.e., technologies that can be quickly adapted for use in mass vaccination devices.  Technologies must be amenable for use with live-virus vaccines, thus mechanical and thermal stress to the vaccine must be minimized.  Vaccines of immediate interest include measles, measles-rubella, and measles-mumps-rubella.  Technologies must generate respirable aerosols with most particles in 2 to 10 micrometer size range and aerosolization rates of approximately 300 microliters per minute.  Technologies should be capable of packaging into compact, portable devices requiring minimal electrical power (e.g., rechargeable batteries) and capable of rugged field use.  Anticipated use will involve administration of up to 100 doses per hour and 1000 doses per day (15 to 30 second dose).  Components contacting patient or vaccine must be low cost and disposable.  Target costs for disposable components are less than $0.05 to 0.10 per vaccinee.  Balance of device may be reusable and with target cost of less than $250 per device.  Interested parties should provide brief written submittals (less than 5 pages), to be received by the Government by COB on July 25, 2003.  Submittals need not adhere to any specific format but should provide information on (1) description of technology, (2) summary of aerosol generation performance, (3) estimated cost of disposables and device, and (4) present development status.  Proprietary material is discouraged, but if submitted, must be clearly marked with a notice at the top of each page.  The Government will evaluate submittals for aerosol generation performance, fit to ongoing device development programs, technological maturity, and potential for meeting cost targets.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Mailing address for submissions is Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, PGO/Acquisition & Assistance Branch B, Attn:  Ms. Johnnie Thomas, 2920 Brandywine Road, Mailstop E-01, Atlanta, GA  30341-5539.

<DESC>A- The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) hereby issues a Request for Information (RFI) to identify sources capable of providing support for the operation of the Reliability Analysis Center (RAC).  DISA will consider this information in the development of its recompete acquisition strategy.   The RAC is one of thirteen contractor-operated DoD chartered Information Analysis Centers (IAC) which collect, analyze, synthesize, and disseminate scientific and technical (STI) information and promote standardization within their respective fields.  The IACs’ mission is to improve the productivity of researchers, engineers, and program managers in the Defense research, development, and acquisition communities by collecting, analyzing, synthesizing, and disseminating worldwide scientific and technical information in clearly defined, specialized fields or subject areas.  The IACs’ secondary mission is to promote standardization within their respective fields.  They accomplish these missions by providing in-depth analysis services and creating products.  IACs respond to technical inquiries; prepare state-of-the-art reports, handbooks, and databooks; perform technology assessments; and support exchanges of information among scientists, engineers, and practitioners of various disciplines within the scope or the IAC.  The RAC is the focal point to improve the reliability, maintainability, quality, supportability and Interoperability (RMQSI) of systems and manufactured components.  The RAC provides valuable assistance to military and commercial researchers and engineers in the areas of (R/Q/M/S/I) of DoD systems, military systems, and the industrial and research base, which supports such systems.  The purpose of the RAC is: 1) to support the DoD research, development, test, acquisition and operational activities; 2) to assist DoD components/offices, other Government agencies, academia, Government contractors and U.S. industry as authorized, in the analysis and dissemination of the information within the R/M/S/Q/I areas; and 3) to promote the exchange of technical information within the R/M/S/Q/I subject areas throughout DoD's research, development and acquisition communities.   The RAC  continually monitors and extracts R/M/S/Q/I related STI from worldwide engineering, technical and scientific information sources, including documents, databases, and electronic, paper, and other information media.  In order to facilitate use of STI, the RAC performs studies and analyses; collect, synthesize, and disseminate STI; develop and maintain inventories of relevant information, easily searchable and accessible information repositories, and experts; and provide scientific and technical advice to Government, industry, academia, and other approved domestic users.  The RAC ensures maximum use of the resources of other DoD IACs.  RAC information collection, analysis, and dissemination efforts should facilitate use of existing STI, while reducing unnecessary duplication of research, information collection and analysis, and information dissemination efforts.  The RAC should be operated in a manner that reduces incentives to establish redundant collection of R/M/S/Q/I related STI.  The RAC shall accomplish these objectives through methods that include, but are not limited to, the development and maintenance of anticipatory marketing of IAC products and services to STI users in Government, industry, and academia, as well as decision and policy makers in the RDT&E and acquisition communities.  The RAC shall seek out and identify  opportunities to provide R/M/S/Q/I information to DoD components, other U.S. Government agencies and departments, their contractors, and other authorized users of RAC information and services.   RAC has been in existence for over thirty-five (35) years and is still necessary to support the DoD needs.  RAC is currently operating under contract SPO077-97-D-4006, which expires 28 Feb 2004.  In order to maintain RAC as a center of technical excellence for (RMSQI) technology, the continuity of operations is essential;  therefore, award of a one-year basic contract, with nine, one-year option periods, is anticipated.  A draft Statement of Work is hereby attached.

Interest vendors should provide a capability statement that describes the following:  1) The ability to provide the above service and experience in providing such service; 2) the size and scope of your previous efforts; and 3) any additional information that you believe would be helpful to DISA.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Contractors that are capable of providing all of the services identified above and in accordance with the draft SOW should submit a capability statement to Ms. Stephanie Baker at e-mail bakers@ncr.disa.mil within five calendar days after publication of this notice.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA_s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date.   Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process.  Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria.   NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED (INCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF ANY KITS) MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.

All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer_s name.  Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.

Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ).

<DESC>IF YOU WOULD LIKE A MORE EASILY READABLE COPY OF THIS NOTICE, PLEASE CONTACT SUE PROCTOR AT 708-786-5182 OR SUSAN.PROCTOR@MED.VA.GOV SUBJ:  Sources Sought Notice for Medical/Surgical Items  This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various medical/surgical items.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA_s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date.   Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process.  Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria.   NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED (INCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF ANY KITS) MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559.  All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer_s name.  Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed.  If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria.  In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples.  Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.  If detailed literature or sufficient information addressing the evaluation criteria is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel will be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products will be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award.  For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183.  Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples.  If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract. The VHA Medical/Surgical User Group, a group of VA physicians, nurses, and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable.   **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Acquisition and Analysis Service (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141**   SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN JULY 25, 2003.

<SUBJECT>A -- IN VITRO GENOTOXICITY ANALYSES OF RESPIRABLE EXHAUST FROM DIESEL ENGINES
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV has a project entitled “Collection and in vitro genotoxicity analyses of respirable particulate exhaust materials from commercial mobile diesel engines: activities of solvent extracts or surfactant-solubilized particles versus engine operation parameters. “   The objective is to collect and determine the in vitro genotoxicity, including salmonella mutagenicity, eucaryotic cell chromosomal and DNA damage, and cell transformation of diesel engine exhaust respirable particulate samples.  Engines shall be representative of those involved in occupational exposures, and shall be sampled by the contractor in a range of operating parameters including torque, rpm, and injection timing.  The collected exhaust materials will be assayed as solvent extracts and as dispersions into models of pulmonary alveolar lining surfactant.
The surfactant-solubilization method of respirable particulate preparation for in vitro genotoxicity assay is a unique method invented by NIOSH research.  It is developmental in its applications  to specific samples.  Only NIOSH researchers and researchers from this West Virginia University laboratory have experience in the use of this method, therefore, we intend to make a non-competitive award to the WVU Research Corporation. The location of the West Virginia University adjacent to the NIOSH facility uniquely permits immediate and ongoing review and evaluation of the research by NIOSH researchers for consequent prompt redirection as needed of the genotoxicity assays, of the sample collection and sample preparation procedures, and of the review, discussion and selection engine operational parameters for exhaust sample generation.
Organizations that believe they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves to the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the posting date of this notice. Interested parties shall provide documentation which demonstrates that they have the expertise and capabilities necessary to meet the stated requirements. Please forward capabilities and supporting information to: Brenda L. Goodwin., Reference: #HELD03E0048,  DHHS, PHS, CDC, NIOSH, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will solely be used for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days, award will be made to West Virginia University Research Corporation under the authority of FAR 6.302-3. All information received will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>R--Reannouncement of OMB Circular A-76 Commercial Activities Study of Clerical Support Services in Georgia Second Transition Notice
<DESC>This is the second and final notice concerning the reannouncement of OMB Circular A-76 Commercial Activities Study of Clerical Support Services in Georgia.  The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Rresources Conservation Service (NRCS) published two sources sought notices for clerical support services in eight locations throughout the State of Georgia under Solicitation No. NRCS-6-GA-03 on March 27, 2003 and April 11, 2003.  The notices stated that this was an OMB Circular A-76 Direct Conversion with Cost Comparison Study.  Following those notices, a Presolicitation Notice under Solicitation No. NRCS-14-GA-03 was issued on may 30, 2003 and a delay notice issued on June 16, 2003 for the same services which stated that the study was conducted under the OMB A-76 Circular.  Currently Government personnel provide these services.  Prospective offerors were advised that the Goverhment reserved the right to retain the work in-house and make no award of contract.  Since the Presolicitation Notiace under NRCS-14-GA-03 was issued after the Revision of OMB Circular A-76 was made known, the NRCS is notifying prospective offerors of the transition of this study to the streamlined competition procedures described in the revised OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003.  Certain deviations may be incorporated, as approved by OMB, for retention of previous cost rules and procedures that were in effect prior to the issuance of the revised circular.  NRCS is further transitioning from the Direct Conversion with Cost Comparison Study to the USDA Express Review Study under the Circular.  Under this method, no solicitation will be issued, therefore, Solicitation No NRCS-14-GA-03 is withdrawn and cancelled.  If after the study is completed, the cost of in-house performance by Government personnel for the services is determined to be the most cost effective, the services will remain in house and continue to be performed by Government employees.  If the results of the study indicate that contract performance is less costly than performance in house, the Government will prepare the necessary documents to solicit the services from outside sources.

<SUBJECT>R--OMB Circular A-76 Commercial Activities Study of Mail/Supply Services Transition to USDA Express Review - Second Notice
<DESC>This is second of two notices published by the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service for the transition for Mail/Supply services in Athens, Georgia to USDA Express Review Study.  The NRCS originally set aside the mail/supply services position in Athens, Gerogia as a Direct Conversion with JWOD under OMB Circular A-76.  No sources sought notices were placed in the FedBizOps for this position because in FAR JWOD set asides do not require publishing in the FedBizOpps.   Prior to preparing and issuing a solicitation, the Revised OMB Circular A-76 was issued effective May 29, 2003.  The revised OMB Circular A-76 does not allow direct conversions, therefore, the transition into the streamlined competition procedures of the revised circular are in effect.  Since the NRCS had tentatively made a decision previously, the NRCS is further transitioning into using the USDA Express Review Study under the OMB Circular A-76.  Certain deviations may be incorporated, as approved by OMB, for retention of the previous cost rules or procedures.  Under this method, no solicitation will be issued.  If after the study is completed, the in-house cost for the services are determined to be the most cost effective, the services will remain in house and continue to be performed by a Governmetn employee.  If the results  of the study indicate that contract performance is less costly than performance in house, the Government will prepare the necessary documents to solicit the services through a JWOD set aside with Cost Comparison.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed price proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-03-Q-0019 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14 effective June 23, 2003. This is a 100% small business set-aside under NAICS 519120 with a size standard of $6 million. The Government reserves the right to make an award on the initial quote without discussions of this procurement. Award will be based on a best value determination, price and other factors considered. Other factors for award include past performance and a responsible offeror’s ability to meet the salient functional and technical requirements as listed below for the preservation of photographic holdings of the National Archive and Records Administration (NARA), Rocky Mountain Region. BACKGROUND: NARA – Rocky Mountain Region is responsible for the identification and preservation of records in archival holdings in the region. A typical series may include photographic prints, negatives, and slides, and textual materials consisting of photographic record sheets relating to the images. Prints/negatives range in size from 2 x 2” to 10” wide panoramic images, which are currently rolled. Almost all the images are enclosed in highly acidic paper sleeves on which are printed basic captions listing date, location, project number, name of photographer, and road number. The sleeves are in poor to terrible condition: extremely brittle, crumbling away with each handling, leaving the prints unprotected.  They are housed for the most part in acidic, gritty, FRC-style boxes not suitable for archival storage. Although some items are currently considered low-use, most series are of uniquely high potential research value and may be become more frequently used once processing (including preparation of an item list) is completed. The photographs provide valuable images of the West, including early highway routes, conditions, and construction techniques, and documentation of surrounding environments such as forests, national parks, and historic shots of structures and communities. Records for the initial contract consist of approximately 31 cubic feet of photographs stored in approximately 26 FRC boxes, 6 archival hollinger boxes, and two ½ size boxes. There are approximately 38,000 photographs and images. REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor will be required to perform the following services: remove photographs from current boxes; remove each photograph, negative, and/or slide from its current sleeve or mounting if they are determined to be of sub-archival quality (mounted photographs will be left on their backing sheets unless removal can be effected without damaging the print); place each item into an appropriately sized archival photograph envelope or mylar sleeve; place panorama photos and other oversize prints in mylar sleeves and in acid-free boxes of appropriate size, placing a cross-reference sheet in original position to indicate removal of item; in cases in which caption information was printed on the old sleeve, either transcribe the photograph number/caption onto the new enclosure, or photocopy the caption onto archival bond paper and attach it to or place it in the new sleeve; examine photographs/negatives/slides for signs of deterioration; for example, fading, breaking, or cracked emulsion (keep a listing of the location of these damaged photographs); place the properly enclosed photographs into archival-quality boxes of the appropriate size. The photographs may be stored in an upright position if they are packed firmly enough to prevent them from curling or slumping in the box; or they may be stored horizontally in order to allow them to flatten; place any textual materials in appropriately sized acid-free folders and archival containers; create new box label containing the following information: record group number (same on all boxes), record group title (same on all boxes), originating office (may vary with each series), series title (may vary with each series), box contents (varies on each box), attach the label to the box. (Labels are pre-pasted but not pressure sensitive--they require moistening.), annotate existing paperwork to indicate new box number of photographs. Key personnel must demonstrate related experience with similar preservation projects. Offerors must submit a brief description of relevant experience, duties, and responsibilities. Work must be undertaken during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, unless mutually agreed upon by NARA and the Contractor. NARA – Rocky Mountain Region will provide workspace and all materials. Work will be performed at the following location: Rocky Mountain Region; Building 48, Denver Federal Center; West 6th Avenue and Kipling Street; Denver, Colorado 80225. Original arrangement scheme and order of the photographs must be maintained. All work must be completed on a schedule mutually agreed upon by the vendor and the Government no later than September 30, 2004. No transportation or travel expenses will be paid. Vendor must accept credit card or direct deposit for payment via electronic funds transfer. Offeror’s price proposal shall be based on the cost to perform the requirement, in its entirety, during the 12 month period beginning October 1, 2003 and ending September 30, 2004 utilizing the following structure: CLIN 0001 (Archival Activity for FY ’04). The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant fixed price purchase order: FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items (Oct 2000); each offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items (June 2003), with the quotation. A copy of the provisions can be found at http://www.arnet.gov/far/; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Terms (February 2002); FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items (June 2003). Paragraph (b) of this clause incorporates by reference the following FAR clauses: 52.222-3 Convict Labor, 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.232-34 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-36 Payment by Third Party, and 52.233-3 Protest After Award.

The solicitation number is NAMA-03-Q-0021 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to award a 100% Small business set aside. 1.1 Model. The requested audio analyzer, with options listed, is required to update the audio analysis capabilities of the NARA Recording Lab as a transition is made from analog audio recording formats to digital audio formats for preservation and access to NARA materials.  The analyzer currently on hand in the Lab is sufficient for conducting necessary calibration and repair activities on older analog equipment, and for the conduct of QA analysis of contractor’s analog products.  It is not sufficient for the newer, more technically precise and demanding digital recording technologies.  The particular analyzer requested, or it’s equivalent, has all necessary current, and anticipated future, testing capabilities required considering the level of sophistication of recording technology that NARA likely will be using in the future.  This analyzer will enhance the efficiency of operations in the Recording Lab and will have application to areas outside audio recording in the matter of the analysis and manipulation of bit streams representing Dynamic Media.The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect though Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12 effective January 24,2003. The government reserves the right to make an award on the initial quote without discussion of this procurement. Evaluation Factors: Award will be based on the lowest price technically acceptable offer, and delivery.

Salient characteristics:

2. Design. Completely independent analog and digital test signal generation and analysis that ensures accurate testing of both analog and digital equipment.  Analog system test signals are generated in a time-continuous analog manner, rather than being generated digitally and then converted to analog thereby introducing the inaccuracies of the test signal digital-to-analog converter into the test stream.

2.1 Meets stringent requirements for internal noise, distortion, response, and bandwidth.  Analog system noise = better than –122db A-weighted.  Analog system THD+N 20kHz BW = better than –110db.  Digital system distortion/spurious products = better than = -158db.  Frequency response = better than +/-0.003db 20-20kHz.  Analog bandwidth = 500kHz for measurement, 200kHz signal generation.  Jitter = better than 0.9ns for the generator and 1.6ns for the analyzer.

2.2. Can process digital streams at the required 192 kilo-sample per second rate and lower continuously selectable rates including, but not limited to, 96kss, 88.2kss, 44.1kss

2.3. Includes wow & flutter, tone burst, and inter-modulation distortion testing capability.  Media transport speed variation (wow & flutter) analysis capability consistent with the requirements set forth in NAB, IEC, and JIS specifications.  Scrape flutter measurements, weighted and unweighted.  Tone burst capabilities to 20kHz with unlimited selection of burst frequencies and periods from the control computer.  White and pink noise signals.  Inter-modulation distortion test signal generation and analysis in accordance with SMPTE/DIN, and CCIF, specification.

2.4. Control and interface via general-purpose computer including all aspects of input, output, and analysis parameters with extended capability for data analysis and display.  Includes internal DSP capability for high-speed signal processing under parameter control of the general-purpose computer for FFT, frequency, phase, noise, THD+N, and IMD analysis.


2.5. Facility for rigorous digital interface testing including triggered eye-patterns, histograms, FFTs, controlled interface perturbation injection, interface test signal generation, and complete data gathering, analysis, and display on the external control computer.
