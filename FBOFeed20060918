<DESC>Description:  ALTERNATIVE INLET SYSTEM FOR A PERKIN ELMER ICP-MS... DESC: The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to the Perkin Elmer Corporation, Shelton, CT for the following: 1.  LSX-213 Laser Ablation System â€“ 1 each. 2.  Adapter-Laser E6000 â€“ 1 each. This request is considered to be sole source to the Perkin Elmer Corporation because this procurement is for an alternative inlet system for an existing, government-owned, Perkin Elmer ICP-MS.  It must be compatible with the operating conditions and software of the existing system.  It must be serviceable by Perkin Elmer Corporation. Perkin Elmer sells, warrantees, and services this laser ablation (LA) inlet as an integral part of the entire LA-ICP-MS system.  Any other LA inlet or vendor cannot warrantee and service the system as a whole.  Fragmented warrantee and/or service agreements which can result in extended down-time while â€œwhoâ€™s responsibleâ€ issues are resolved must be avoided.  It must physically interface with the existing government equipment without modification that would void or limit the existing warrantee.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Firms who want to challenge the sole source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the firmâ€™s ability to provide the services or work described above.  Interested parties must provide rationale as to why they should be considered.  Interested parties shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability. All interested firms must respond to DE-RQ26-06NT00976 by 05:00 P.M. EST, September 28, 2006.  Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  The North American Industrial Classification Code (NAIC) is 334516.  This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770.  The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Mr. Karl Schroeder, PHONE 412-386-5910

<CONTACT>Point of Contact -Donald MacGee, Contract Specialist, 617-494-2803
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation No. DTRT57-06-R-20038 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12.  The NAICS Code is 511140 and the Small Business size standard is 500 employees.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a proposal is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority in FAR Part 6.302.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price contract and to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with OAG Worldwide, Inc., Downers Grove, IL, to provide customized subscriptions services for one (1) Base Period (52 weeks)(10/28/06-10/26/07) and four (4) Option Periods (52 weeks each) described below. The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has a requirement for domestic and international airline schedule data as part of the Volpe Center?s Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) project, in support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The ETMS relies on this data to allow the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) to effectively and safely manage the nation?s airports and airspace. Current and accurate flight information is used in ETMS to balance aircraft capacity and demand for airports and airway fixes, and is used by ATCSCC specialists to predict potential traffic problems and to avoid delays by implementing national traffic management initiatives.  The services required demand that ETMS have continuous and reliable flight schedule data.  The Contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, and services to provide the following customized subscription services, (1) WEEKLY BULK DATA TRANSMISSIONS ? the Contractor shall provide for a full flight schedule to be made available weekly on a day and time to be coordinated with the Volpe Center.  The range of data shall be for 45 days; (2) WEEKLY FLIGHT RECORD CHANGES ? 1. Provide effective and discontinue dates.  If there is no effective date available the date reverts to the first day of the delivered data files. If there is no discontinue date the date reverts to the last date of data. There are to be no assumptions.  2. Provide a carrier code in the carrier code field when there is no match in the FAA carrier code table. This change will give the FAA more flexibility in determining which carriers are missing from the FAA carrier code table.  3. Provide for the deletion of multiple flight records. Since the flight data is primarily a marketing tool, the schedule information contained in the scheduled flight data may reflect a slightly different set of flights from what is actually flown during the applicable time period.  4. Provide all flight leg segments for flights worldwide.  5. Provide all segments of scheduled flight records. There will be times a carrier will fly from a U.S. airport to an international airport with a non-ticket-selling stop at another U.S. airport. The second segment of this flight should be included; (3) AIRCRAFT/CITY TRACKING SYSTEM (ACTS FILES) ? The contractor shall provide an updated copy of airlines equipment and airports made during the previous quarter;  (4) DATA TRANSMISSION ? The files will be placed in a directory on a host machine, which can be assessed remotely by Volpe Center staff. The Volpe Center will work with the contractor to incorporate any future changes to the current transmission procedures, file structures, and file content. The file structure for the bulk data transmission files shall be: ASCII, Sequential File, 56 characters per line. Proposals shall include pricing for the following ten line items in a written quotation:   CLIN 0001 ? Quarterly ACTS File ? (4 EA) _____________; CLIN 0002 ? Weekly OAG Update ? (52 EA) _____________;  CLIN 0003 ? First Option Period ? Quarterly ACTS File ? (4 EA) ______________;   CLIN 0004 ? First Option Period ? Weekly OAG Update ? (52 EA) _____________;   CLIN 0005 ? Second Option Period ? Quarterly ACTS File ? (4 EA) _____________;   CLIN 0006 ? Second Option Period ? Weekly OAG Update ? (52 EA) ____________;   CLIN 0007 ? Third Option Period ? Quarterly ACTS File ? (4 EA) _____________;  CLIN 0008 ? Third Option Period ? Weekly OAG Update ? (52 EA) _____________;  CLIN 0009 ? Fourth Option Period ? Quarterly ACTS File ? (4 EA) _____________; and CLIN 0010 ? Fourth Option Period ? Weekly OAG Update ? (52 EA) _____________.

The ability to detect the newer explosives the liquids, acids, and peroxide based (TATP) - this is our largest concern
The detectors are already being used by DOD, US Customs, DEA, among others ? already has a proven track record
The ability to detect either narcotics or explosives ? we can detect either without changing anything
The samples maybe taken by vacuum, swipe, or direct air sampling ? saves from opening packages or vehicle compartments
The screen read out gives an indication of exactly how much of a substance is present ? this helps with false positives
Works in hot and cold weather environments ? weather is no factor
The mechanism can work from a car charger or regular current ? allows for transport to remote locations on the base
8 second turns around from sample to results ? speeds things along
Detects the largest array of elements out there ? plus the library is upgradeable
Offerors will be required to indicate the salient physical, functional or performance characteristics of the offering so that a technical assessment may be conducted.  
The NAICS for this acquisition is 423490 and the business size standard is 100 employees. Women owned and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to submit offers ? The proposed contract listed here is unrestricted.

GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: new construction or major renovation of an office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) of approximately $1 million dollars or more.  The contractor's personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project. The approximate duration of the contract is 365 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed.  The estimated cost of this project is over 1 million dollars ($1,000,000.00).  Award will be full and open competition.  The procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.  Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, current projects, Team Organization/Communication qualified/experienced personnel and on their price proposals. The acquisition process shall consist of two phases: Phase 1- Receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing selected drawings and a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors.  Phase 2 - Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.  In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 2, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.

Phase 2- Receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer).  Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 2.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance, 2. Key Personnel & Experience.,3.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Panama City, Florida intends to  award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to  Code Fount, 1822 Grant Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94133-2409. This requirement is to develop schemes and algorithms for multi-signal underwater acoustic systems capable of producing high resolution 3-D images.  Code Fount will develop pulses with low interferences both in the time domain and in the frequency domain, based potentially on Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWFs) and conventional wavelet bases.  Additionally, Code Fount will develop corresponding synthetic aperture imaging techniques for obtaining  acoustic images with high resolution in elevation information.  This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Code Fount employs two of the world leading experts on computational harmonic analysis and numerical aspects of the Prolate Spheroidal Wave F!  unctions.  Code Fount is the only source that can meet this requirement.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  Period of performance will be twelve (12 ) months from issuance of the order. NAICS 541710. FSC AD91.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED AS A "100% HUBZONE SET-ASIDE". The SIC Code for this Solicitation is 237130: The Size Standard is $31,000,000.00 This project will replace the existing 1959 vintage 15 kV three phase switching station #1 with modern 15 kV switchgear in a protective enclosure.  The new switching station switchgear lineup will consist of three circuit breakers for circuits B, C, and D with one spare circuit breaker and one spare space for future growth.  The enclosure will protect the equipment from exposure to the salt water/air and protect maintenance personnel when performing circuit breaker maintenance and troubleshooting procedures.  The new 15 kV circuit breakers will have microprocessor controlled protective relaying functions to properly coordinate the power distribution system at this location.  There will be a SCADA-type control system provided to control the functions of the circuit breakers and protective relaying for this switching station.  The control station will be located at the control room of Building 160.  There will be pole line work associated with installation of the new switching station to re-connect the existing circuits fed from the switchgear and to allow circuits to be bypassed during switchgear maintenance procedures.  The new switching station enclosure will be raised to above current flood elevations in that area (13.25 feet above sea level) by construction of a masonry platform with stairway access.  The new elevation of the switchgear will be 14.25 feet above sea level.  The existing truck access for the fuel tanks in this area will be re-graded and repaired to allow access around the new switching station.  Grass sod will be placed in the disturbed area around the new switching station to prevent erosion in this area.  The Government will award a fixed-price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose total evaluated price and technical proposal provide the best value to the Government, using LOW PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE methodology.   Price and technical factors are considered of equal importance.  The Technical Factors to be addressed are:  (1) Past Performance, (2) Experience, (3) Technical Qualifications,  (4) Construction Schedule.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; to award the contract to other than the proposer submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE Terms.  Proposers should not assume they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR SPECIFICATIONS. The Government intends to issue the entire solicitation on or about 14 July 2006. The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil. ALL PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS MUST REGISTER IN THE CCR DATA BASE AT www.ccr.gov.  LACK OF REGISTRATION IN THE CCR DATA BASE WILL MAKE AN OFFEROR INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD.  The official plan holder's list will be maintained and can be printed from the web site.  Amendments will be posted on the web site for downloading.  This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with Bio-Rad Laboratories in Hercules, CA to furnish and deliver, F.O.B. Destination, to the USDA, ARS, NAA, U.S. Plant, Soil & Nutrition Lab, Tower Road, Ithaca, New York, for an iQ5, Real-Time PCR System, Laptop Computer and accessories, and System Software. The system also includes shipping, a one year parts and labor warranty on the equipment and an extended warranty on the PCR System.  This system will be used to quantify relative levels of gene expression in plant pathogenic bacteria. DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS: The Bio-RAD IQ5 is designed to perform and analyze 96 quantitative RT-PCR reactions.  This system has the unique capacity to 1) operate in a thermal gradient mode, which is essential for optimizing reaction conditions especially in multiplex reactions. 2) Provide thermal block ramp rates that heat at least 3C/sec and cool at 2.0C/sec. Rapid ramp time is important for increasing throughput by decreasing elapsed run time. 3) Maintain block temperatures within 0.3 degrees C of the programmed temperature and with no more than (plus/minus)0.4 degrees C variation between wells.  These tolerances are important because qRT-PCR analysis requires a high degree of accuracy in thermal cycling in order to achieve reproducible results. 4) The ability to be used as a stand-alone thermocycler. This is necessary to prolong the useful life of the equipment.  5) True 5 color multiplexing is required to allow simultaneous monitoring of the expression levels of five genes.  This is necessary for increasing throughput and reliability of quantitation by providing internal controls.  6) The instrument must be open platform, which will allow use of reagents from other suppliers, which will reduce the cost of reactions by allowing competition for reagents.  7) The data format is fully documented.  Data outputs are required to be standardized so that they will be exportable into custom analysis and data management software.  Our research (e.g., catalog search, internet search and meetings with sales representatives) has shown that while other systems satisfy some of our specifications, only the Bio-Rad IQ5 system sold by Bio-Rad Laboratories is able to satisfy all of our specifications.  Companies with the demonstrated capability and financial capacity to provide and service such equipment must submit a written substantive statement outlining the Company's and systems' capabilities, available service agreements and consumables (including price lists) to the Contracting Officer within 5 days of publication of this notice.  This is not a request for proposal.  No solicitation is available.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517310.

(2) Provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to answer affirmatively questions A through H of Appendix CC, Part 2, Number 8, (AFARS 19.705). (3) Any subcontracting plan th at is rated 70 percent or less under the AFARS evaluation system will be carefully considered for acceptability. If discussions with offerors are necessary, those areas where the plan is deficient will be reviewed with the offeror with the goal of correcti ng deficiencies. Due to requirements for review of the successful offeror's subcontracting plan by other agencies, the Government reserves the right to negotiate the fin al plan with the successful offeror before award. e. Part 5 - Cost and Price.  The offerors proposed cost and price will be evaluated for reasonableness and affordability.  Technical Capability and Past Performance are more important than price.  3.  Metho d of Proposal Evaluation.  a. Governments Rights and Goals.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award, to negotiate with any or all offerors, to award a contract to other than the offeror submitting the l owest price offer, and to award a contract to the offeror submitting the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government.  b. Evaluation Process.  A Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB), comprised of qualified personnel, will evaluate the  proposals.  The team will independently evaluate each proposal in response to this RFP and rate them in accordance with the provisions established in the RFP.  The technical and non-technical aspects of each proposal will be evaluated.  Weighing of evalua tion criteria takes into consideration the importance of a particular element. The SSEB will review each proposal to determine if they contain the required minimum procurement and technical data. Each proposal must contain all the information required by the RFP. A proposal may be determined to be unacceptable and eliminated if requi red information is missing or the proposal materially deviates from the requirements of the RFP.  The evaluation process essentially consists of four parts: proposal compliance review, technical/quality evaluation, price evaluation, and cost/technical trad e-off analysis.  (1) Proposal Compliance Review.  This is an initial check by Contracting Division on the basis of the RFP requirements. This review may eliminate those proposals that fail to provide all required information and documents in the format and  detail specified. This review is to ensure that all required information is complete.  (2) Technical/Quality Evaluation. The SSEB, using technical advisors, if  necessary, will evaluate all proposals submitted in response to the RFP. (3) Price Evaluation.  The Government will initially evaluate price independently from the technical evaluation. Price will not be rated, but will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness through the use of a price analysis. The price evaluators will also check for appearan ce of unbalancing of bids. Offerors are cautioned to include all applicable costs in the appropriate bid items, and to evenly distribute indirect costs (such as job overhead, home office overhead, bond, etc.) to the appropriate bid items.  (4) Cost/Technic al Trade-off Analysis. After the price analysis and technical/quality evaluations are complete, the Government will then consider the price in connection with the technical/quality evaluation to determine the proposal offering the most advantage to the Gov ernment. The Government will compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of the technical proposals and compare prices. The trade-off analysis will be conducted upon completion of the quality/price evaluations of Final Proposal Revisions, if discussi ons are necessary, or after evaluation of initial offers, if discussions will not be necessary. Some trade-off considerations are usually part of the process of determining which firms will be included in the competitive range for discussions, if discussio ns are necessary. The requirements of Section 00700, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HubZone Small Business Concerns, will be applied in making the cost/technical trade-off analysis.  If discussions are not needed, the Government will award to th e contractor submitting the best overall value.  If it is determined that discussions must be held, a competitive range shall be established.  The competitive range shall consist of those firms considered to be the highest qualified and having the best cha nce of being awarded a resultant contract.  At that time, the entire proposal su bmitted by the contractor may be targeted by the Government for discussions.  An award will be made to the offeror whose offer contains the combination of the criteria offering the best overall proposal to the Government based on consideration of technical  merit, project schedule, past performance, cost, and other pertinent factors as specified in the RFP.  All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest cost offer provided the superior offer provides a technical advantage which offsets the additional cost.  Using the above basis for determination, the Contracting Officer will select the firm submitting the overall best va lue to the Government for award of a contract.  c. Selection.  Selection of a Contractor will be made by an integrated assessment of the proposals submitted. In essence, the integrated assessment will involve a determination by the Government of the overal l merit of each Contractor's proposal, recognizing that subjective judgment on the part of the Government's evaluators is implicit in the entire process. This award will be made to the offeror whom the Government determines is able to accomplish the necess ary work and provide the required service to satisfy the objectives and requirements set forth in the Request for Proposals in a manner most advantageous to the Government. The Government may reject any or all proposals and waive minor informalities or min or irregularities in proposals. This award will result in a firm fixed-price contract.  NOTE:  ALL OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD A CONTRACT, WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFERORS (OTHER THAN DISCUSSIONS CONDUC TED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MINOR CLARIFICATION).  HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS IF IT IS LATER DETERMINED BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER TO BE NECESSARY, AT WHICH TIME DISCUSSIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED WITH ALL OFFERORS DETERMINED T O BE IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE. THEREFORE, EACH INITIAL OFFER SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFEROR'S BEST TERMS FROM A TECHNICAL AND COST OR PRICE (IF APPLICABLE) STANDPOINT. DO NOT ASSUME YOU WILL BE CONTACTED OR AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY, DISCUSS, OR REVIS E YOUR PROPOSAL.  d. Notification of Selection.  The Contracting Officer will notify the selected offeror upon Contract Award.  e. Notification of Non-Selection.  At the end of the establishment of the competitive range and Contract Award, the Contracting Officer will notify each offeror not selected, advising them of their right to request a debriefing. Plans and specifications will be available on the Technicl Data Solutions (FEDTEDS) Web Page at http://www.fedteds.gov.  Compact discs and hardcopies will not be available. Offerors should check http://www.fedteds.gov often for new solicitations and/or changes (AMENDMENTS) to existing ones.  Issue date on or about 05 Oct 2006.  Proposals are due not later than 1645 hours, 20 Nov 2006.  Funds are not presentl y available for this acquisition. Rights-of-Way are not presently available for this acquisition.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposal as being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   RFQ N00189-06-T-0337 is issued as a  Request for Quote.   This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12. The FSC is 41, the NAICS code for this requirement is 423730.  The Contracting Department at FISC Norfolk intends to purchase on a full and open competitive basis the following item:  0001, 1 each,  Brand Name or Equal to Trane, 100 Ton, Air Cooled Helical rotary Chiller, Model #RTAA-100.  Salient characteristics:    Replacement chiller that will interface with the existing Johnson Controls Metasys DDC System.  The replacement system   will require a conduit run for the LON wire from chiller to the DDC control panel.   The unit requires 460 volt/60 hertz/3 phase electrical connections.  The unit must comply with efficiency requirements of  ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1999 and CAN/CSA C743-02.   Because of the need for form and fit, the unit shall fit on the existing cement pad that measures 234? x 90? and work in conjunction with the existing 140 Ton Trane Chiller already installed at the facility.  Installation of the unit will include all necessary services to install and interface the unit.  Installation shall also include all materials for piping, wiring of new unit to existing building structures and interface as described, as well as demolition of the old chiller that is being replaced.   

Definition and specifications of LON:  LonWorks is a networking platform specifically created to address the unique performance, reliability, installation, and maintenance needs of control applications. The platform is built on a low bandwidth protocol created by Echelon Corporation for networking devices over media such as twisted pair, powerlines, fiber optics and RE. It is popular for the automation of various functions within buildings such as lightIng and HVAC.

Manufacturers in a variety of industries including building, home, transportation, utility, and industrial automation have adopted the platform as the basis for their product and service offerings. To date, thousands of companies have built products and applications on top of the platform, performing such diverse functions as embedded machine control, municipal and highway street lighting, heating and air conditioning systems, intelligent electricity metering, subway train control, stadium lighting and speaker control, security systems, fire detection and suppression, and newborn location monitoring and alarming.

The platform has its origins with chip designs, power line and twisted pair signaling technology, routers, network management software, and other products from Echelon Corporation. In 1999 the communications protocol (then known as LonTalk) was submitted to ANSI and accepted as a standard for control networking (ANSIJEIA7O9.1-B). Echelon?s power line and twisted pair signaling technology was also submitted to ANSI for standardization and accepted. Since then, ANSI/E1A709. I has been accepted as the basis for IEEE 1473 -L (in-train controls), AAR Electro-pneumatic braking systems for freight trains, IFSF (European petrol station control), SEMI (semiconductor equipment manufacturing), and in January 2005 as prENl49O8 (European building automation, preliminary standard). The protocol is also one of data link/physical layers of the BACnet ASHRAE/ANSJ standard for building automation.

The LonWorks platform also has an affiliated 11, tunneling standard, EIA-852, in use by a number of manufacturers to connect the devices on previously deployed and new LonWorks based networks to IP aware applications or remote network management tools.

The ANSI/EIA7O9. 1 standard document is available from ANSI and reference implementations are available online for porting the protocol to a variety of processors. Alternatively, microchips that have the protocol logic hard-wired in are available from a number of suppliers either as stand-alone integrated circuits (IC) or as a combined integrated circuit/transceiver. In Lonworks these IC?s are known as ?Neurons?.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the CS Statutory Mandate:  The CS Statutory Mandate should be incorporated in the Evaluation Criteria item #7.  Proposal due date is October 2, 2006. CS Statutory Mandate:CS STATUTORY MANDATE: The following is the relevant section of the CS statutory mandate (15 USC 4721 (b)): Statement of purpose. The U.S. Commercial Service shall place primary emphasis on the promotion of exports of goods and services from the United States, particularly by small businesses and medium-sized businesses, and on the protection of United States business interests abroad by carrying out activities such as ? i. Identifying United States businesses with the potential to export goods and services and providing such businesses with advice and information on establishing export businesses;ii. Providing United States exporters with information on economic
conditions, market opportunities, the status of the intellectual property system in such country, and the legal and regulatory environment within foreign countries;iii. Providing United States exporters with information and advice on the necessary adaptation of product design and marketing strategy to meet the differingcultural and technicalrequirementsof foreigncountries;
iv. Providing United States exporters with actual leads and an
introduction to contacts within foreign countries; v. Assisting United States exporters in locating reliable sources of business services in foreign countries; vi. Assisting United States exporters in their dealings with foreign governments and enterprises owned by foreign governments; vii. Assisting the coordination of the efforts of State and local agencies and private organizations which seek to promote United States business
interests abroad so as to maximize their effectiveness and minimize the duplication of efforts; viii. Utilizing district and foreign offices as one-stop shops for United States exporters by providing exporters with information on all export promotion and export finance activities of the Federal Government, assisting
exporters in identifying which Federal programs may be of greatest assistance,and assisting exporters in making contact with the Federal programs identified;and ix. Providing United States exporters and export finance institutions with information on all financing and insurance programs of the Export-Import
Bank of the United States, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade and Development Program, and the Small Business Administration, including providing assistance in completing applications for such programs and working
with exporters and export finance institutions to address any deficiencies in such applications that have been submitted. The U.S. Commercial Service ("CS") is the worldwide client service delivery arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA), operating over 100 U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) domestically, and approximately 150 Commercial Posts in 80 countries overseas. The CS is statutorily mandated to provide export promotion and facilitation services, products and programs to small and medium-sized U.S. business enterprises (SME's) globally. The CS provides on a cost recovery user-fee basis a wide range of market research, trade contacts, matchmaking (Le., U.S. seller with foreign buyer) and business facilitation products and services. These services include, but are not limited to, the following: Gold Key Matchmaking Service, Export Education Seminars in the U.S., Import from the U.S. Education Seminars targeting international buyers of U.S. products and services, Market Research, International Buyer Delegations, Trade Leads and U.S. Pavilions at Certified Trade Fairs. The CS also provides Counseling and Advocacy. For a full list of CS programs and services, please visit the following web site: http://www.export.qov/commsvc/csproductsservices.html 
The U.S. Commercial Service also operates the Trade Information Center (TIC) - a call center which can be reached by calling 1 800 USA TRADE. The TIC is the first stop for companies seeking export assistance from the U.S. Government. TIC international trade specialists: a.	advise exporters on how to locate and use government programs; b.	guide businesses through the export process; c.direct businesses to market research and trade leads; 
d.provide information on domestic and overseas trade events and activities; e.	explain sources of public and private export financing; f.	help exporters locate reports and statistics on trade; and, g.	refer businesses to state and local trade organizations that can provide additional assistance. The TIC also provides export counseling for the Western Hemisphere (including NAFTA), Western Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (including the China Business Information Center). TIC international trade specialists can help exporters with questions about: a.import tariffs, taxes, and customs procedures; b.	standards, intellectual property rights, government procurement, and other c.	commercial laws, regulations, and practices; d.	distribution channels, business travel, and other market information; e.	opportunities and best prospects for U.S. companies in individual markets; and, f.difficulties encountered on specific commercial transactions C.3 Purpose 
This requirement is to provide cooperative support with the CS to structure and implement public-private partnerships resulting in increased marketing, promotion and subscription sales of CS programs and services.

Detailed requirements and reference material for this system can be found at http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil. Although the acquisition approach has not been finalized, the Government does not intend to hold a full and open competition or award a sole source contract for this effort.  Instead, the Government is planning to use the Air Force Network Centric Solutions (NETCENTS) contract to procure the TDC ICE v3.0 package.

Please limit your qualification package to a maximum of 5 pages. Your response must provide specific information on why you are qualified to integrate and test the TDC ICE v3.0 package for the Government.  This should include relevant experience with other tactical communications integration efforts.  Your response must also include feedback on the proposed strategy to include risks along with an overview schedule.   Questions and comments should be submitted electronically, independent of the submitted package, to Kelli.Reinhardt@hanscom.af.mil. All answers to submitted questions will be posted on HERBB.  Questions and answers of a proprietary nature will be handled on a case by case basis. Responses are requested no later than 1:00 pm EST on 11 July 2006.  Responses must include the company name, address, size of business (i.e., large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-connected veteran-owned small business, women-owned business, or HUBZone small business), whether U.S. or foreign owned entity, and a company point of contact.  Please limit your qualification package to a maximum of 5 pages.

The Department of Defense is initiating a spiral development effort to counter both the existing threat posed by radio controlled Improvised Electronic Devices (IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the long-term worldwide IED threat.  The Naval Sea Systems Command is planning to execute procurements to address these combined threats.  The DoD will first award one or more contracts to design, develop, fabricate, and test both man portable (dismounted) and vehicle mounted (mounted) Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems.  By incorporating technical advances over existing CREW systems, these systems will address both the urgent requirement for dismounted CREW systems in Iraq and Afghanistan and initiate development and demonstration of the next generation dismounted CREW systems.  These next generation dismounted and mounted systems will provide a technological bridge leading to an integrated system of systems.  The final procuremen!  t will integrate dismounted, mounted and fixed CREW systems into a single system of systems capable of addressing the future worldwide CREW threats.   The Naval Sea Systems Command plans to initiate procurement of the dismounted and mounted systems with a release of a Request for Procurement RFP in 1st GFY07 followed by contract award early 2nd Quarter GFY07.  Industry will have approximately a seven month development period leading to a one year Government test cycle.  The Government anticipates awarding production contract in 3rd Quarter GFY 08, requiring initial delivery late the same quarter.   Contract award for the integrated system of systems procurement is planned for 4TH Quarter GFY08 with initial delivery planned for 2ND Quarter FY12.  The DoD will provide specific details of these acquisition strategies during the industry day on 26 September 2006.   The Department of Defense is developing detailed program requirements and specifications for each of these procurements.  Basic requirements will include increased portability (smaller/lighter dismounted systems, reduced vehicle impact for mounted systems), reduced power demands, increased frequency coverage, increased modularity, increased interoperability with other CREW systems, and improved compatibility with other DoD systems.  Specific details of these requirements will be presented during the industry day on 26 September 2006.   The information provided herein is for information only and is not a Request for Proposal or announcement of a solicitation.   This synopsis does not constitute an invitation for bid or Request for Proposal, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a contract or order.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement nor will the government return any data provided.

1. Description of the supplies and services being acquired: AFOATS intends to procure copies of seven sets of the World in Transition Series from the Southern Center for International Studies (SCIS) as a reusable resource for the Air Force ROTC senior course (AS400) and Officer Training School.  AFROTC and OTS require 50 copies of the entire series to meet the replenishment requirements of the 144 AFROTC detachments, the Regional Offices, the Curriculum Division and 54 OTS Flight Rooms.  These series were originally procured from Southern Center for International Studies over the past decade, and this is an additional quantity to re-supply the same materials.

2. Justification for Sole Source (see paragraph ii(A & B) on the attached template): SCIS is the only company capable of satisfying this requirement, as it owns the sole intellectual proprietary rights (copyrights) to the material.   In the past, ROTC has used a locally produced AS 400 Regional Studies Reader based on SCIS copyrighted material.  However, this copyright since expired and SCIS will not renew the copyright release.  This material is expected to stay in print through 2013.  Through an Internet market survey and discussion with publishers, it was found that the SCIS textbooks, AS 400 World in Transition Series, is the only one available in the required quality and quantities.  

3. Justification that source is the only known source (talk to your efforts to find other sources):  There are no other sources available with the unique AFROTC and OTS requirements included in these materials.  This purchase must be consistent with the materials currently in use at OTS and the various AFROTC detachments to ensure continuity in the cadets? instruction.  Purchasing materials that do not conform to the materials in place would be detrimental to the OTS and AFROTC mission.  AFOATS has based the entire regional studies/cultural awareness program on SCIS copyrighted material.  At this time, it is not economically feasible to alter our curricula by changing the source material we provide for our staff and students.

4. Actions taken to preclude future sole source acquisitions: No action can be taken to preclude future sole source acquisitions under the current conditions (proprietary ownership of intellectual property (copyright)).

Functionality:  CISCO 9216is with SSM 32 Port Module, CX3-80 w/30 TB Usable, CENTERA:  This equipment is to be added to an existing Storage Area Network Infrastructure to increase the current storage capability.  This equipment components listed compris e a total system.   b. Hardware:  Exact specifications must be maintained for exact replication of the existing infrastructure at the COOP facility.  No substitution is acceptable.  Data Replication cannot be accomplished with multiple vendor solutions.  The DMX and CX equipm ent, coupled with the CISCO equipment that is already in place at the command facility, comprise a total storage solution.  Only EMC provides the proprietary technology to incorporate SD RF into the existing infrastructure.  c. Maintenance:  24/7 maintenance service with a 4-hour on-site technical response is required.  Locations:  Ft. Belvoir, VA and Ft. Huachuca, AZ.  This critical service is necessary to provide recovery from system outages as well as equipment failure.  Ma intenance for the additional equipment is covered under an existing lease with EMC Corporation (EMC).  Procurement of a different brand named item would require the procurement of additional maintenance.   d. Compatibility:  The existing Storage Area Network Infrastructure was established   using EMC equipment. Using EMC's SDRF technology to mirror between sites       requires placing Symmetrix controllers at both ends, and making connections via       proprietary equipment.   The SDRF technology offered by EMC was chosen      because it is proven to be the most secure form of data replication in the industry.  Components added to the existing infrastructure must support the proprietary SDRF technology, and be mirrored at the base site as well as the COOP site. This requirement is 100% set-aside for 8(a) certified Small Businesses.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334112 and is associated with the small business size standard of 1,000 employees.   Although the intent of this notice is not to solicit competitive quotations, interested sources are not precluded from identifying their interest and capability to respond to this requirement via e-mail to: tremayne.w.terry@us.army.mil or fax (703) 428-491 4 by no later than 21 SEP 06, 10:00 AM (EST).

<SUBJECT>--Cancellation and re-issuance of notice concerning - Requirement for Panasonic Toughbook Computers
<DESC>The notice entitled, Requirement for Panasonic Toughbook Computers, is cancelled and re-issued as follows: This notice is posted as an intent to award contract for commercial items.  The items required under this contract will be deemed brand name in nature in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.211-6 - Brand Name or Equal.  This notice is n ot a request for competitive quotations, but a notice of the US Army Intelligence and Security Commands (INSCOM) intent to procure the following items:  Toughbook Ruggedized Notebook Computer   Part Number:  CF-Y4HWPZZBM (Quantity:     20);   Panasonic 51 2MB Memory Centrino   Part Number:  CF-WMBAV0512 (Quantity:     20) JUSTIFCATION FOR PROCUREMENT OF BRAND NAME OR EQUAL items listed above: a.  Maintenance Cost:  3 Year On-Site Next Business Day Maintenance Service included.  HQ INSCOM and the majority of INSCOM Major Subordinate Commands (MSCs) maintain existing maintenance contracts with Panasonic for extended service of Panasonic Toughbook  ruggedized notebooks employed on DoD Command and Control networks. The incorporation of other Brand Name ruggedized notebooks would require additional maintenance contracts at additional cost.  b.  Compatibility:  HQ INSCOM and the INSCOM MSCs have expended significant resources over many years to establish industry-standard, state-of-the-art, high performance, optimized, manageable, reliable and secure system infrastructures by continuously rese arching the market and consistently selecting best of breed products. Panasonic Toughbooks are the original ruggedized notebook, represent the industry standard for semi-rugged and fully-ruggedized (mil-spec) notebooks, and consistently account for greater  market share of their market segment than all others combined. Standardization on a single ruggedized notebook manufacturer maximizes efficiency of system administration, management & maintenance, and promotes confidentiality, integrity and availability o f mission critical data on DoD command and control networks. Standardization on Panasonic Toughbooks provides the following benefits: industry standard, state of the art capabilities; consistent technical design; compatibility, integration & interoperabili ty with existing systems infrastructure; consistent interface for ease of administration & training; standardized management, optimization & troubleshooting tools & procedures; compatibility with third-party tools & applications; ease of administration via  standardized system images & software baselines for various Panasonic Toughbook models; consistent security administration for systems & data; standardization of patch management and Information Assurance Vulnerability Assessment (IAVA) compliance and imp lementation via Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS); consolidation of maintenance via single cost-effective maintenance contract and stockage of standard replacement parts inventory. The incorporation of non-Panasonic Toughbook ruggedized notebooks into the INSCOM standardized environment, while possibly providing a minor cost savings initially, would over the long run significantly increase system administration & management requireme nts, potentially reduce system & data security, and increase IT support manpower and funding requirements. Both INSCOM CIO/G6 and the MSCs will continue to conduct due dilligence researching emerging technologies & products from all vendors to ensure that systems infrastructure maintains superior performance, reliability and security. This requirement is being accomplished via the Army Small Computer Program (ASCP) as mandated by the Department of the Army as the primary source for commercial IT equipment.   Written questions concerning this requirement may be submitted via e-mail to: tremayne.w.terry@us.army.mil or fax (703) 428-4914.

MUST BE ABLE TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION OF AUTHORIZATION FROM REMEDY. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  CA/CST/DO needs programming capability to implement the new Remedy system.  These software development licenses will be used to create a developmental/test environment for the ARS-DO implementation of the Remedy ITSM products suite.  As well as creating a separate development/test environment for ARS-DO Remedy, these licenses will also allow the DO-Training team to train users using a mirror image of the current product database without impacting the production dataset. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line.  Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment. (4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. (4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. The project team has received a dedicated server intended for use as a development and testing server.  It has been configured and is currently using temporary demo licenses obtained from BMC.  These temporary licenses allow DO to utilize the server for development and testing on the implemented ITSM modules until the purchase of development licenses is completed.  Development and training on the remaining modules cannot be performed in the system’s current state.  Using the dedicated server, the project team will apply the development licenses, which will provide the ability to perform development and testing activities for all ITSM modules in an isolated environment.  The development environment will mirror the production environment in every aspect possible.  Changes made in the development environment can be: ·	Duplicated in the production environment which will be the case with successfully tested and approved changes ·	Rolled back in the case of failed changes, unapproved changes, and after each training session to reset the databases, allowing the next training session to be conducted 	Separating the development from the production environment is an industry best practice.  The greatest benefit of the development environment will be that all changes that might cause a service disruption are isolated. Additionally, if developmental efforts have to be performed in the production environment, DO’s Remedy ITSM suite would be significantly impeded.

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions. FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation. Bids must be valid for 30 days after close of competition. No Exceptions or Qualifications. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Tektronix Oscilloscopes.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State meeting accreditation standards, infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. DS/TPS/SECD has identified the Tektronix 3054B Oscilloscope as a key component in establishing and maintaining an essential engineering school, specifically TSCM, at the Departments’ educational institution, namely the Diplomatic Security Training Center.  This equipment is used solely by the national level TSCM Engineering Academy as well.  The training center is an official preparatory agency for the national TSCM Engineering academy which uses the Tektronix 3054B with the video and advanced analysis options exclusively in their training suite.  These Oscilloscopes are used exclusively by operational TSCM teams nationwide.  The purchase of these Oscilloscopes is easily supported by the Department’s Countermeasures Program which is outfitted for the repair and maintenance of these oscilloscopes but not for other brands.  The 41 USC 253 (c)(3)(b), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one specific vendor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of our engineering schools requirements.  The Tektronix brand name oscilloscope is available from multiple vendors. These oscilloscopes will also be used for engineering research at the Department’s educational institution in the furtherance of the current Engineering curriculum pursuant to 41 USC 253 (c)(3)(b).

Firms lacking a record of relevant past performance history, or for whom information on past performance is not available, shall receive a neutral evaluation.  Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate for the base year and each option year.  The labor category totals for the base year and each option year will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.

1.0 - Introduction: 

In order to maintain the safety and reliability of the armored USAID/DCHA/OFDA fleet in the field, it is necessary to periodically replace the wearable vehicle parts. The run-flat systems that are currently installed on the armored Toyota Land Cruiser positioned in South Africa are compromising the safety and reliability of the vehicle. 
 
The capability of the United States Government (USG) to quickly and safely respond to international emergencies is dependent on the reliability of the field fleet. To ensure that these vehicles are ready at all times, it is necessary to replace those parts which serve to compromise the integrity and safety of the vehicle armor system. Run-flat tires represent a portion of this system. The run-flat tires currently installed on this vehicle have had multiple problems in the recent past. To prevent these problems from re-occurring during an emergency situation, five replacement run-flat systems need to be acquired for this vehicle (one for each tire and one for the spare).

This procurement will be for five new, unused run-flat tire systems to be installed on an armored Toyota Land Cruiser.  In accordance with the following specifications:  

  Five standard 16” run-flat replacements with wheel profiles:
  B1170 (16 x 6.5 steel wheel), including inserts and metal valve
  stems. These replacements need to be compatible with either
  275/70 R16 or 235/85 R16 tires. 

The authorized source, origin and nationality for this procurement is geographic code 000, United States of America.


3.0 - Delivery:

Delivery of the Run Flat system will take place immediately upon award, but not later than September 1st, 2006.  The contractor will be required to provide ODFA Logistics with weight, dimensions, and specifications of the cargo (individual carton and palletized) prior to shipment from vendor’s warehouse, after packaged for transport.  

Delivery shall be made at the Contractor’s premises, in accordance with FAR 52.247-30, F.O.B. Origin, Contractor’s Facility

Inspection and acceptance of all deliverables required hereunder shall be performed by the cognizant USAID CTO for this Purchase Order or his/her designee.


5.0 - Marking requirement:
  
Marking shall be in accordance with clause AIDAR 752.7009 Marking (JAN 1993).

Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding feder al holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, an d on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor shoul d anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete o r hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weeke nds large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issue d at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast  Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logist ics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street G ate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate P rogram is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local claus e 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identificat ion badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate i n the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fa st access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by th e Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and th e fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohib ited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contrac tor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGP C or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft,  or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the  loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless prec luded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the c ontract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.   If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for acc ess to the installation.

Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING Line Items 13, 81, 91, 92 ; The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Overseas Installations Branch (IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Transition Brand media converters and chassis.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.   IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Transition media converters and chassis as key components of the Department’s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network cabling infrastructure based on compatibility with existing Transition media converters and chassis installed at multiple U.S. Foreign Missions and the standardization of warehouse management, bills of materials issuance, and successful installations and subsequent converter replacements.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Transition Media Converters are necessary for installation and replacement into Transition media converter centers (chassis); other brands of converters are not compatible with each others’ chassis’.  Using other brand name media converters would require restocking the warehouse with other brand name chassis’ to accommodate the other brand name converters.  Simple one-for-one replacement would not be practical as it may entail a completely new chassis and multiple media converters at one or more locations, for example, all that may be required is to add a media converter, this would not be possible if the media converter is a different brand than the existing chassis and media converters.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Corning Fiber Optic Unicam Connectors, Fiber Optic Adapter Panels, and Rack Mount Enclosures.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure distribution requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Corning Fiber Optic Unicam Connectors, Fiber Optic Terminating Kits, Fiber Optic Adapter Panels, and Rack Mount Enclosures as key components of the Department’s network cabling distribution system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network cabling distribution to existing Department of State network cabling distribution systems based on compatibility (size, color, fit, etc) with existing, compatible Corning Fiber Optic Unicam Connectors, Fiber Optic Adapter Panels, and Rack Mount Enclosures presently installed at U.S. Foreign Missions worldwide and currently in stock in the ITL warehouse.   The Installations Branch currently has Corning products in stock and requires the same name brand to maintain distribution system integrity, and standardization of warehouse, bill of materials, and installation managementThe 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.

The Corning Fiber Optic Unicam Connectors, Fiber Optic Terminating Kits, Fiber Optic Adapter Panels, and Rack Mount Enclosures are necessary for seamless integration and installation to existing fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures within the Department’s network cabling distribution systems.  Using other brand name fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures would require restocking the warehouse with the same other brand fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures and subsequent replacement of the entire warehouse stock of existing compatible items.  Simple one-for-one replacements or additions as needed would not be practical as it may entail a completely new cabling distribution system at one or more locations. Installation teams also have connector installation kits that are compatible only with the Corning Unicam Fiber Optic SC-type connectors.  The requested acquisition is to replenish warehouse stock and is based on compatibility with existing warehouse stock and installation tool kits and methods.

Items that do not confirm to descriptions and part numbers found in this RFQ will be rejec 0044 ted at the time of delivery causing a return at the vendors expense. Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after submission New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products Agencies may require registration with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to receipt of order. Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING Line Items 13, 81, 91, 92 ; The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Overseas Installations Branch (IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Transition Brand media converters and chassis.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.   IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Transition media converters and chassis as key components of the Department’s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network cabling infrastructure based on compatibility with existing Transition media converters and chassis installed at multiple U.S. Foreign Missions and the standardization of warehouse management, bills of materials issuance, and successful installations and subsequent converter replacements.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Transition Media Converters are necessary for installation and replacement into Transition media converter centers (chassis); other brands of converters are not compatible with each others’ chassis’.  Using other brand name media converters would require restocking the warehouse with other brand name chassis’ to accommodate the other brand name converters.  Simple one-for-one replacement would not be practical as it may entail a completely new chassis and multiple media converters at one or more locations, for example, all that may be required is to add a media converter, this would not be possible if the media converter is a different brand than the existing chassis and media converters.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure distribution requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Corning Fiber Optic Unicam Connectors, Fiber Optic Terminating Kits, Fiber Optic Adapter Panels, and Rack Mount Enclosures as key components of the Department’s network cabling distribution system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network cabling distribution to existing Department of State network cabling distribution systems based on compatibility (size, color, fit, etc) with existing, compatible Corning Fiber Optic Unicam Connectors, Fiber Optic Adapter Panels, and Rack Mount Enclosures presently installed at U.S. Foreign Missions worldwide and currently in stock in the ITL warehouse.   The Installations Branch currently has Corning products in stock and requires the same name brand to maintain distribution system integrity, and standardization of warehouse, bill of materials, and installation managementThe 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.

Using other brand name fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures would require restocking the warehouse with the same other brand fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures and subsequent replacement of the entire warehouse stock of existing compatible items.  Simple one-for-one replacements or additions as needed would not be practical as it may entail a completely new cabling distribution system at one or more locations. Installation teams also have connector installation kits that are compatible only with the Corning Unicam Fiber Optic SC-type connectors.  The requested acquisition is to replenish warehouse stock and is based on compatibility with existing warehouse stock and installation tool kits and methods.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Chief Technology Office.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Department of State approved Desktop IT equipment. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements of compatibility with existing operational equipment across the DS Enterprise. Because of the interchangeable parts supporting the equipment, it provides a cost effective process in managing an Enterprise asset that is used by DS in all of its CONUS locations. By standardizing on one baseline configuration, the management and support render to the end user is streamlined. DS/CTO/SMD/OPS has identified Dell Desktop equipment as a key component for DS desktop support. Dell desktop equipment is required to provide compatible hardware configuration with existing Department of State’s enterprise desktop equipment management tools and standardize software configurations that are common to the Brand Name in support of video drivers, NIC drivers and compatible removable drive components. These are essential management tools in support of non-CTO manned Resident and Field office support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement.

<DESC>AMENDMENT AS FOLLOWS:
Question1:  Do you want the Generator towable unit to have a pintle hitch with a receiver on the rear to tow the Portable A/C & Heater unit behind? This will allow only one vehicle needed to tow the units. Yes we would want a pintle hitch on the rear of the A/C unit. 
 
Question 2:  There is no mention on hitch configuration; we assume you want a Pintle Hook setup? We would prefer to have a pintle hook setup; this is the most universal setup with our other support equipment and tow vehicles.
 
Question 3:  Fuel type for the generator? We would prefer to have diesel fuel, again this the universal fuel type so it would be readily available.
 
Question 4:  Flexible Duct size [diameter] and length of duct. We need 8 inch diameter and approximately 160 feet long.  We would like to keep the number of sections to a minimum to provide a 100 foot length and two similar length stubs (approximately 30 foot each) off the main 100 foot trunk.  A continuous length is not required.  Any cost effective solution is acceptable.
 
Question 5:  Plug configuration for the Portable AC/Heater. Keep in mind we can configure the plugs the same as the GLC system; we just need to know what you would like. A Generator plug to the A/C & Heater / A Generator plug to the GLC System. So, what plug configuration is on the GLC? We'll need to adapt to the GLC. The air conditioner/heater unit must have plug compatible with the Cooper ARKTITE Series 3R, AR-1042, Model M3, 3 pole, 4 wire, 600 volt, 100 ampere jack currently installed in the hangar.  The generator should have two load cords with a cord-mount mate to the air conditioner connector that is functionally equivalent of the ARKTITE AR-1042. 
 
Question 6:  Regarding the plug above; we need to know the length of cord you will need for each unit. 
We need a minimum of 85 feet for the air conditioner unit.  The generator should have a minimum of 10 feet of cordage, depending on the connection point, to allow the mated connectors to rest on the ground without inducing strain on the generator or posing a trip hazard.
 
Question 7:  Do you currently have a unit described in this solicitation on site that you would like to replicate? Unfortunately, no.

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT 02 TO THE VA COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION VA-791-06-RQ-0013, AS POSTED ON SEP 06, 2006. This solicitation is amended as follows:  Paragraph 1.1.1 and 7 are revised per the Performance Work Statement, as revised 18 September 2006.   The following questions and their responses are provided to all offerors: Question: Is there an incumbent provider? If so, who is it?  	Revised Answer: American Medical Response (AMR). B.  Question:  In reading section 1.1.1 of the SOW it specifically states:  &quot;1.1.1 The contractor is authorized to and shall bill separately for patient transport and emergency response services by seeking reimbursement in accordance with paragraph 5. The contractor shall bill for Basic Life Support (BLS), not Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ALS)&quot; which my interpretation is that all patients that are transported will be billed at the BLS rate and not an ALS rate even if ALS services are provided. Reading further, section 7.4 states &quot;7.4 Seek the appropriate reimbursement for the type of ambulance services provided. If only BLS service is provided. The contractor will bill for a BLS, not ALS, response. The contractor will not send and bill for wheelchair accessible ambulances unless medically indicated.&quot; Which although doesn't explicitly state that the patient could be billed at the ALS rate if ALS services are provided to the patient, it appears to me to infer that it could. The inclusion of ALS billing where ALS levels of care are provided will significantly reduce the subsidy we will be requesting in our bid. 	Answer:  See revised PWS Question:  Does the contract require all certification documentation, resume, and physical documentation be included or do we simply need to certify that we have all of the documentation on file, also should we include an internal employee roster which contains much of the requested information in synopsis form? Answer:  All certification and physical documentation must be available upon request but not necessarily submitted in the RFQ package.  Offerors are cautioned that it is their responsibility to provide sufficient documentation to allow for evaluation by the Government.  Please refer to solicitation evaluation criteria. &#160;&#160; All other terms and conditions are unchanged.  The date responses are due remains unchanged at 19 September 2006.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received. Question: It is our current understanding that you are requesting only the GenSet with a base tank and on-site testing and training. You do not require an ATS, disconnects or installation services, correct? Answer: The requirement is for a 500 kW packaged generator with outdoor enclosure and base tank.  All ATS, installation, and connection services will be performed by a separate contract. Question: Is the due date going to change? Answer: The deadline for proposal submission has not changed. Question: The Statement contains square boxes. Could you help me to clarify the text? What do the squares mean? Answer: The square boxes in the combined synopsis/solicitation are a formatting error.  The square boxes should be hyphens.  Question: Should the generator be mounted on a trailer for transportation? Answer: The generator will be placed outside on a concrete slab.  A trailer is not required. Question: Is the generator going to be placed in a room or outside? Answer: The generator will be placed outside.  The outdoor enclosure shall match the exterior brick facade. Question: The RFG calls for: 500kW 120/208V 1200A circuit breaker  The following shows the amperages allowed at different voltages based on a 500kW output. 208V = 1734A 240V = 1503A 480V = 751A This shows that we need to go with 480V and also we need to go with an 800A circuit breaker (based off a circuit breaker overload of 115%).  Is this correct? Answer: The 1200 amp rating is incorrect. The correct rating should be 2000 amp.

Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Ac cess Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holiday s, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concr ete or hot asphalt conc rete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles  (needing greater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate g uard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of s ubcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane  except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully imple mented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmissi on Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any c ontract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lew is more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logisti cs Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participa tes in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history backg round check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CH BC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access ide ntification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor em ployee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within th e required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he /she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, wit h or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcon tractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reprodu ction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to accomplish the following: Provide answers to the below Technical Questions and to extend the closing date from September 18, 2006 12PM MST to September 20, 2006 12PM MST. Technical Questions and Answers to Solicitation W9124-06-T-0085: Question #1: Is there a company that has provided this item in the past, and can I get their name or web address? Answer #1: It is up to the offerer to conduct their own market research. Therefore, no information will be provided.  Question #2:   Is a 2 part system (consisting of a munitions chamber unit with a separate conditioning system) preferred; or would you consider a single piece unit that has 15' of separation between the munitions and the conditioning system? Answer #2: Separate trailers are preferred for the conditioning unit and the chamber. This provides some versatility for us and keeps the trailers to a size that can be pulled with a pickup. Questions #3:  How do you intend to tow this unit (what type and size of truck or vehicles) Answer #3: The unit will be towed by pickup.  Question #4: Are design sketches or drawings available? Answer #4: No sketches or drawings are available.
