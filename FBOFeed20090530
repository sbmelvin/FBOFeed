<SOLNBR>APP9-10-0902-02
<RESPDATE>062209
<CONTACT>Cynthia Ingrao, Phone 619-532-8517, Email cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil
<DESC><p>A. General Information
<p>Southwest Region seeks approval to standardize One-Step Surgical Skin Prep with 2% Chlorhexidine and 70% Isopropyl Alcohol for its 10 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical facilities in California. This standardization action for this product line is a new initiative for the Southwest Region. It is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection; however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. This product line includes the following products in the following sizes: 1) an applicator sponge device which delivers a range of 0.5 to 3 ml of solution which contains 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol; 2) an applicator sponge device which delivers a range of 10 to 15 ml of solution which contains 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol and 3) an applicator sponge device which delivers a range of 25 to 30 ml of solution which contains 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol in clear and tinted versions appropriate for the application of use.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, Cardinal, currently serving the Southwest Region.</p>
<p>The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP's Prime vendor program and obtaining a DAPA please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is October 2009. The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.</p>

<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required<br /><br />The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of One-Step Surgical Skin Prep with 2% Chlorhexidine and 70% Isopropyl Alcohol. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $96,000. This is a new product line, which addresses the newer standards of care in the prevention of Surgical Site Infections and the prevention of nosocomial infections. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.</p>
<p>At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than June 22, 2009. Submissions must be received by COB, 5:00 PM PDST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified. If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:</p>
<p>Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN <br />Tri-Service Regional Business Office <br />MSMMO - Southwest Region <br />34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 <br />San Diego, CA 92134 <br />Phone: (619) 532-8517</p>
<p>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer. We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.<br />Vendors will be required to provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and product literature. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.</p>
<p>The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate: (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Criteria<br />1. Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of One Step Surgical Prep 2% Chlorhexidine With 70% Isopropyl Alcohol. A &lsquo;complete line of product' is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes the following products in the following sizes: 1) an applicator sponge device which delivers a range of 0.5 to 3 ml of solution which contains 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol; 2) an applicator sponge device which delivers a range of 10 to 15 ml of solution which contains 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol and 3) an applicator sponge device which delivers a range of 25 to 30 ml of solution which contains 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol in clear and tinted versions appropriate for the application of use.</p>
<p>2. Vendor must provide CDC certification, for clinical efficacy in skin asepsis and the microbial control of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS), S. aureaus, Enterococcus species, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; as well as, effectiveness against multi-drug resistant microorganisms including, but not limited to MRSA, VRE, C.Difficil, Acinetobacter, Candida and Pseudomonas species, for all itemized brand(s) and styles that are manufactured and/or distributed for One Step Surgical Skin Prep products.</p>
<p>3. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the One Step Surgical Skin Prep product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submission. Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.</p>
<p>4. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in the Southwest Region. Vendors whose products are not available through Cardinal Health will be disqualified.</p>
<p>5. Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off DAPA. Vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.</p>
<p>6. Vendors must have a vendor representative(s) available in the Southwest Region. Please provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submission.</p>
<p>7. Vendors must provide proof of corrective actions(s)/ resolution for any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for One Step Surgical Skin Prep with at least 2% chlorhexidine and at least 70% isopropyl alcohol products, including dates, duration, cause and resolution. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.</p>
<p>8. Vendors must provide the MSDS literature for each product offered.</p>
<p>9. Vendors must provide in-service staff training and identify company resources for such requirements with the initial submissions.</p>
<p>10. Vendors must provide educational tools and materials for One Step Surgical Skin Prep with at least 2% chlorhexidine and at least 70% isopropyl alcohol products, and provide evidence of this with the initial submission. For instance, provide a written description of the tools/materials available.</p>
<p>11. Vendors must identify if there is any latex component in the device or packaging of the One Step Surgical Skin Prep product.</p>
<p>12. Vendors must provide products with visible expiration dates and product description on the labeling/packaging.</p>
<p>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. The TPRB will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples. Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00PM PDST, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.</p>
<p>The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree and 5 = Strongly Agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The evaluations are conducted a clinical setting. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the "break", in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.</p>
<p>A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria<br />1. The product container &amp; wrapping are durable and intact and ensure no leakage of the prep solution. This ensures the product's sterility is maintained and eliminates the potential for degradation of the product. The wrapping alerts users of latex or non-latex content and expiration date.<br />a. The product container &amp; wrapping are free of holes, punctures, splits in the heat sealed edges and does not leak solution from any of the seams or edges. The wrapping states the latex content and expiration date.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 3 times.<br />c. The evaluators will carefully scrutinize the entire package for any punctures, tears or compromise to the sealed edges, latex content, &amp; expiration date. The expectation is that no evidence of breaks in the barrier of the packaging or evidence of liquid seepage will be found and the user would be alerted of latex content and expiration date.</p>
<p>2. The sponge applicator is constructed in a way that ensures an even, controlled application of solution onto the skin. <br />a. The sponge applicator controls the amount of solution delivered as it is applied to the skin area. No surges in the amount of liquid or leakage from the applicator will occur.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 3 times.<br />c. The clinicians using this product on the patient's skin will closely observe the applicator for any evidence of an uneven delivery of solution. The expectation is that the applicator will control the amount of solution delivered during use.</p>
<p>3. The device's container holds an adequate amount of solution to prepare the patient's skin for surgery. There is sufficient variety in the volumes available to completely cover the surgical site area without need to open a second container.<br />a. A second applicator is not required to complete the skin prep.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 3 times.<br />c. The clinicians using this product will directly observe the adequacy of the amount of solution provided. The expectation is that the device will contain the adequate amount of prep solution.</p>
<p>4. The solution, when applied to the surgical site, will leave an easily identified landmark. Visualization of the prepped skin area is clearly distinguishable from other skin areas to avoid wrong site errors.<br />a. The prepped area of the skin will transition from a very shiny wet appearance to a dull matted appearance for clear solution or will be tinted with the color of the solution. <br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 3 times.<br />c. The clinicians will directly observe for this critical characteristic of having prepped the surgical site. The expectation is that this transition from a shiny skin appearance to a dull matted skin appearance or resulting tinted color will occur.</p>
<p>5. The drying time of the solution is within the time stated by the manufacturer. Excessive drying time interferes with the standard of initiating the application of surgical drapes and protective barriers to the patient.<br />a. The prep solution will dry in accordance with the stated drying time.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 3 times.<br />c. The clinicians will directly observe for the anticipated drying time. The expectation is that the solution will dry in accordance with the product literature.</p>
<p>6. The solution does not have an unpleasant or irritating odor and is not irritating to the skin. An odor that is unpleasant or irritating to the user and patient may cause physical reactions to both. Irritation to the skin of the patient will cause skin breakdown and increase the risk of infection.<br />a. The prep solution will not have an unpleasant or irritating odor and not be irritating to the skin.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 3 times.<br />c. The clinicians will directly observe for odor that is unpleasant and/or irritating and for skin irritation. The expectation is that there will be no unpleasant or irritating odor or skin irritation to the patient.</p>
<p>Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process. All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region. The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor. The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a Purchase Order to Roche Diagnostic Corporation, 9115 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN 46256-1025. A CDC Purchase Order will be issued to acquire the following:<br />1. Roche Linear Array HPV Genotype Kits, QTY: 84 Each, Material No. 04472209190<br />2. Roche Linear Array Detection Kits, QTY: 43 Each, Material No. 03378012190<br />These commercial products are being procured using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b). Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the continued need to match existing products for on-going studies being conducted by the CDC. Failure to procure existing materials in batch lots currently offered by Roche Diagnostics will alter or contaminate assays required for on-going research being conducted by the CDC. It is believed that the Roche Linear Array Kits are the only product currently available on the commercial market that is capable of detecting and tying 37 different HPV types. It is further believed that a failure to acquire the Roche kits by specific lot number will require the CDC / NCZVED Division of Viral and Rickettsial Disease to develop or validate alternative assays for detection and typing of HPV, at a cost signicficantly greater than acquiring these commerically available Roche kits. It is also believed that any data collected on the pre-vaccine type-specific prevalence HPV using an alternate product can not be directly compared to results of other pre-existing assay results, thus skewing or terminating research efforts. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide the Roche Linear Array Kits by serial lot number are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer on or before 3:00 PM (Eastern Standard Time), on June 3, 2009. Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses. Inquires may be sent to Russell T. Oxford by e-mail at roxford@CDC.gov or by fax to 770-488-2044.</p>

<DESC><p>Following are questions and answers (in italics) received:</p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; Does your office impose a maximum hourly bill rate for each position?&nbsp; If yes, could you provide the rates?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:No.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; The solicitation makes the request of retaining the existing employees, could you provide the 2008 hourly rates invoiced to MSHA for each position?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; No I cannot provide these rates.&nbsp; The period of performance on the existing contract is 10/1/07 thru 2/28/09.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; the solicitation makes the request of retaining the existing employees, could you provide the 2009 hourly rates invoiced to MSHA for each position?&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; There isn't a contract yet for 2009.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; Could you please provide the amount of the monthly (or average monthly) invoice to MSHA for this contract?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; No I cannot provide this information.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; Do the existing employees get health benefits?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; Yes</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; Is it required fromt he contractor to provide these benefits?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; Yes, this benefit is required per the Service Contract Act that is referenced in the proposal for each location.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; Is the incumbent allowed to bid on this contract?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; Yes</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; WD No. 2005-2573 does not identify the rate for Administrative Assistant (EFS).&nbsp; Should we assume that Administrative Assistant rate applies for this position as well?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; The two (2) Administrative Assistant positions are the same.&nbsp; The EFS referenced is the department one of the positions is in.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; Is there any employee who meets the needs of 3 weeks vacation per year (i.e. more than 8 years of continuous service at your location?</p>

<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; One of the statements in the solicitation: "Current employees are to be paid the requested hourly rate specified by above wage determinations.&nbsp; The hourly rates may be above the required minimum wage determinationrates".&nbsp; Therefore, if an employee's current rate is higher than the rate listed in WD No. 2005-2573, can we expect the rate will be adjusted appropriately by the contract officer?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; No, the contract officer will not be adjusting the rate.&nbsp; In WD No. 2005-2573, there is a minimum wage rate per hour per position classification listed as well as the health &amp; welfare rates.&nbsp; The contractor will provide a quote for the invoicing rate and if desired, the contractor may increase the hourly wage rate that is paid to the employee.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; Who can I e-mail/call to get contact information for all employees currently filling these positions?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; There should be absolutely no contact with the current contractor or the employees.</em></p>

<DESC><p>The following questions have been asked concerning this solicitation (answers in italics):</p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; For the vacation pay, if the contract is awarded to another service, does that service pick up the accrued vacation from the previous service.</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; Yes, after one (1) year of continuous service the successor contractor would have to pick up the vacation days</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; Does the current contract amount include fully loaded labor rate charges?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; Yes</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; Is the current contract period for 1 fiscal year and 5 months?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; Yes the current contract was initially for one (1) year but was extended for a five (5) month period due to the government operating under a CR (Continuing Resolution).</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; Regarding the invoicing rate in dollar amounts, how can one provide an invoicing rate by position for the current employees without knowing what those employees are currently being paid?&nbsp; In order to prepare a good offer, a contractor would have to know the current hourly rate, in order to include the additional cost of administering such a contract, and the other cost to include would be mark-up.&nbsp; Please explain how your office would expect a good bid offere without that information?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; Please check the SCA (Service Contract Act) Wage Determination that is referenced in the solicitation as well as on the sheets for Base Year and both Option Years per location and position.&nbsp; the Wage Determination lists an hourly rate plus the benefit package cost that you need to provide the invoicing rate per position.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; Can you tell us the length of time that each person currently working on this project has been there?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; Yes, I can give you the total employees&nbsp;with years of service.&nbsp; They are as follows:&nbsp; 3 less than 1 yr.; 2 more than 1 yr.; 1 more than 2 yrs.; 1 more than 3 yrs.; 1 more than 4 yrs.; 1 more than 5 yrs.; 1 more than 7 yrs.; and 1 more than 10 yrs.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; If an employee is on vacation, does that individual need to be replaced with someone else during that time?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; No.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; How long has this contract been in existence, that is, what is the inception dat of this contract and/or what has been the duration?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; The period of performance on this contract is 10/01/07 - 2/28/09.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; How long has the incumbent had the contract?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; Since 10/1/07.</em></p>
<p>QUESITON:&nbsp; How long have the existing temporary employees been on the contract and have the SAME employees been there for the duration of the contract?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; Some were employed on the previous contract.&nbsp; See length of time in previous answer.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; Are you permitted to tell us who provides the health insurance?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; The current contractor is the only one who can provide this information.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; The $3.16 per hour cost for benefits listed, would that be paid by the Contractor to the benefits provider?&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; Yes.</em></p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp; What is the conversion date if the contract is awarded to someone other than the incumbent?&nbsp; Can I ask what has brought this out to bid at this time?</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; The conversion date will be the date the contract is awarded for a 1 year period with 2 option years.&nbsp; The current contract end date is 2/28/09. &nbsp; The government is operating under a Continuing Resolution thru 3/6/09.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>QUESTION: Should the price for Option Years 1 and 2 assume a small inflation of wages using our best guess?&nbsp; If an increase is assumed, will it knock us out for the higher price quote even though this is just a "best guess?"</p>
<p><em>ANSWER:&nbsp; This is considered to be a best value contract for the government.&nbsp; It does not necessarily mean that the lowest bidder will get the award.</em></p>
