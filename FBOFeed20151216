<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>

<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): 26 January 2016<br /><br />- IFB issued (target): end of January 2016</p>
<p>- Bid Closing (target) : March 2016</p>

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity.

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation, and any resultant contracts, is to obtain services of commercially provided aircraft fully operated by qualified personnel and equipped to meet specifications for use in administration and protection of Public Lands. The Government intends to award multiple firm fixed priced, hybrid Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with economic price adjustments, for a base year and three option years not to exceed four years total. This procurement will result in multiple awards of a hybrid Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Type (IDIQ) contract with fixed priced availability rates and economic price adjustments for the flight rates. Due to the volatile fluctuation in aviation fuel prices; the flight rates will be adjusted based on increases and decreases to the prices of aviation fuel as indicated in the economic price adjustment clause specified in the contract. This smokejumper contract program requires the Contractors to provide their aircraft services during certain Mandatory Availability Periods (MAPs) for the exclusive use of the Government. They are paid a daily availability rate during the MAP and an hourly flight rate when they are flown. They are a hybrid IDIQ in the fact that we have a definite quantity for the daily availability period. We specify an exact period of time the aircraft must be available and the Contractor receives a firm fixed priced payment for each day of availability. We also have fixed hourly/unit flight rates that the vendor receives for each hour that the aircraft is flown. However, if the aircraft is never flown the vendor does not receive any payment for flight time.
<p>During the Mandatory Availability Period (MAP) and any extensions thereof, the aircraft will be made available for the exclusive use of the Government.</p>
<p>Aircraft furnished under this contract will be operated from the designated or alternate bases throughout the contiguous United States.</p>
<p>Use will include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>(1) Transportation of personnel, equipment, and supplies for fire suppression and other Forest Service administration activities.<br />(2) Transporting and dropping smokejumpers.<br />(3) Transporting and dropping paracargo.<br />(4) Reconnaissance.<br />(5) Testing of parachutes and other aerial equipment.<br />(6) Air Tactical Operations</p>
<p>Aircraft will be required to perform over rough, mountainous terrain typical of National Forest areas in the western United States at elevations varying from sea level to 13,000 feet, often encountering extremely unfavorable atmospheric conditions.<br />Standby Hours Per Day: 9 Hours Standby per day</p>
<p>The following line items and MAP dates are subject to change in the final solicitation that will be posted at a later date. (See attachment "Line Items")</p>

<DESC>This National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Announcement (NRA) solicits ground-based research proposals from established researchers and graduate students to generate new scientific insights by utilizing experimental data residing in NASAs Physical Sciences Informatics (PSI) system (<A HREF="http://psi.nasa.gov">http://psi.nasa.gov </A>     ), an online database of past and current physical science International Space Station (ISS) flight experiments. The solicitation (NNH15ZTT001N15PSI_B), entitled "Use of the NASA Physical Sciences Informatics System  Appendix B," will be available on or about January 19, 2016. Upon release, the solicitation will be found via the following steps: <P> 1. Open the NSPIRES homepage at <A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/">http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ </A>	 2. Select "Solicitations" 3. Select "Open Solicitations 4. Select "Use of the NASA Physical Sciences Informatics System NNH15ZTT001N 5. Select List of Open Program Elements 6.

Select Appendix B NNH15ZTT001N15PSI_B" under Announcement Documents. <P> NASA plans to host a proposers conference via WebEx shortly after the release of the Appendix to provide more information and to answer questions about the NRA and the PSI system. <p> NASA's Physical Sciences Research Program conducts fundamental and applied physical sciences research, with the objective of enabling improved space systems and technological advances that support new products and other benefits on Earth. NASA's experiments in the various disciplines of physical science reveal how physical systems respond to the near absence of gravity. They also reveal how other forces that on Earth are small, as compared to gravity, can dominate system behavior in space. <p> The PSI system is an online database of science data from past and current physical science ISS flight experiments. It is designed as a tool for investigators to expand upon the valuable research performed on the ISS using it to further science in accordance with the open science approach, while also meeting the requirements of the Presidents Open Data Policy. This NRA solicits ground-based research proposals that present a compelling case on how the experimental data from the PSI system will be used to promote the advancement of further research.

<SOLNBR>NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2016-042-JML
<RESPDATE>122215
<CONTACT>Jonathan M. Lear, Contracting Officer, Email john.lear@nih.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to University of Vermont, 111 Colchester Ave., Burlington, VT 05401-1473 to provide support services for the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) Biospecimen Repository in accordance with the following information.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) was initiated by the NHLBI to determine the risk factors for development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older adults. In 1989-90, the study recruited and conducted a detailed examination of 5,888 adults aged 65 and older at entry in four communities. Nine follow-up exams were conducted annually through 1999, followed by semi-annual phone calls to ascertain new CVD events through May, 2005.</p>
<p>The data and specimens collected in CHS and its more than 200 ancillary studies represent a major national resource for the study of development and progression of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases in older adults. To promote continued use of this resource, the NHLBI has provided contract support for core functions to the CHS Coordinating Center at the University of Washington since 2005. The contractor maintains the CHS data sets, core study operations, and the biorepository that serve as the infrastructure for investigator-initiated research in this cohort of older adults. As a result, CHS continues to be highly productive scientifically.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The objective of this acquisition is to obtain services and expertise in maintenance of the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) biospecimen repository and continued access to the samples for research purposes by qualified investigators. The general requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>- Maintain the security and integrity of the CHS Biorepository.<br />o Maintain inventory and associated databases<br />o Maintain the freezers<br />o Maintain state-of-the-art policies and procedures (as per NCI, NHLBI, ISBER)</p>
<p>- In full compliance with all CHS Policies and Procedures (found at www.chs-nhlbi.org), provide samples to approved CHS ancillary study (AS) investigators.</p>
<p>- Provide limited consultation with AS investigators to help ensure optimized research protocols and productivity.</p>
<p>- Provide inventory reports semi-annually; provide repository impact statements as needed for CHS AS proposal reviews.<br />TASK TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>- Furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities needed to ensure proper maintenance of the CHS sample repository for storage of aliquots, following best practices as described at http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/practices/ and http://www.isber.org/.</p>
<p>- Obtain NHLBI approval, in consultation with the CHS Steering Committee, before providing specimens to designated laboratories for ancillary study analyses. (All related expenses are to be borne by the ancillary studies.)</p>
<p>- Deliver specimens to designated laboratories for ancillary study analyses as directed by NHLBI. (All related expenses are to be borne by the ancillary studies.)</p>
<p>- Prepare the specimen collection for delivery to an NHLBI-designated location(s). (All related expenses to be borne by NHLBI.) This includes working, as resources allow, to consolidate samples into fewer freezers.</p>
<p>- In a limited manner, collaborate with CHS and non-CHS investigators to design new studies that utilize existing CHS biospecimens.</p>
<p>- Maintain accurate and updated records of all samples in the repository.</p>
<p>- Provide repository reports semi-annually and Impact Statements as needed.</p>
<p>- Maintain records of services provided to ancillary studies.</p>
<p>- Respond to inquiries from the NHLBI in a timely manner.</p>
<p>- On completion of the contract, deliver specimens to an NHLBI-designated location.<br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance will be for one (1) year.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the following:</p>
<p>- The collection and storage of samples began at a time before the technology of barcoding sample vials for inventory tracking was available. A custom inventory system was created that enables biorepository staff to locate vials from particular participants containing a specific type of sample, but each vial is not uniquely identified. Nowadays biorepositories - commercial repositories in particular - rely on a computerized inventory system based on barcoded vials. Expecting another source to integrate the CHS inventory system into its own would represent an operational challenge requiring time and additional expense.</p>
<p>- Maintaining the CHS sample collection in its present location would avoid risk of sample loss incurred during transfer of the biospecimen collection to another entity. Many of CHS's twenty -80-degree freezers are very old and susceptible to damage during transport via truck to another location. Relocation of the samples and likely required replacement of irreparably damaged freezers would also add costs.</p>
<p>- Maintaining the repository in its current location would avoid potential delays in providing needed samples to researchers with limited research grant funding and time to conduct their research projects.</p>
<p>- The CHS study design, huge data set, and availability of biorepository samples are complicated. Using them most effectively for research requires the expertise and input of investigators and staff familiar with them who can advise and collaborate with researchers in designing research projects that are doable and make good and efficient use of the resources. This is particularly true for use of the limited resource of the biospecimen collection. The personnel at the University of Vermont, who have worked with the CHS and the biorepository for more than 25 years, are uniquely qualified to provide this expertise, and the biorepository director is a highly accomplished and internationally recognized scientist.<br />REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold), and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 622110, General Medical and Surgical Hospitals, and the Small Business Size Standard is $38.5M. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-85 (December 4, 2015).</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS-NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE- High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Technology Insertion (TI) Bridge Contracts (W912DY-13-G-0022-0011, W912DY-13-G-0022-0012, W912DY-13-G-0022-0013, and W912DY-13-G-0025-0004)
<p><br />The US Army Corps of Engineering - Huntsville Center (USACE-HNC), is issuing this synopsis in order to publicize its intentions to execute four sole-source, firm-fixed priced orders off the Technology Insertion (TI) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) for the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP), in accordance with (IAW) FAR 5.203 - "Publicizing and response time," which states, "A notice must be published at least 15 days before issuance of a solicitation, or a proposed contract action that the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 6.302." Further, in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)(1), the contracting officer is establishing a shorter period for issuance of the solicitation, and this posting shall be open for 10 days prior to issuance of a solicitation.</p>
<p>These bridge orders support supercomputer systems which have been installed at the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), the Navy Research Lab (NRL), the Army Research Lab (ARL), and the Engineering Research &amp; Development Center (ERDC). Justifications and Approvals (J&amp;As) are in the process of being routed for signature which will authorize these requirement to be procured sole-source. The firms that previously designed and installed these systems have been determined to be the only suitable solution when considering the high probability for excessive time delays and substantial duplication of costs IAW FAR 6.302-1 - "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>The existing BOA suite was established in June 2013 with a 5 year life cycle, expiring in June 2018.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Posting - Ruggedized Antennas - 746 TS</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. The Government is seeking information from all sources regarding a potential contract for purchasing ruggedized antennas for the 96th Test Group, 746th Test Squadron, located at Holloman AFB NM. Respondents will not be notified of the responses to this RFI. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, this notice is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations. Information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary" or "Confidential" will not be disclosed outside of Government channels. While a final decision has not been determined, the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is preliminarily set as 334220, Antennas, transmitting and receiving, manufacturing. A set-aside determination has not been made, but is being considered. The Product and Services Code (PSC) is 5985, Antennas, Waveguides and related Equipment.</p>
<p>SECTION 1 - BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The 746th Test Squadron (746 TS) (aka the Central Inertial and Global Positioning System (GPS) Test Facility (CIGTF)) has over 50 years of history conducting guidance and navigation testing. A key enabler to the unit's test and evaluation (T&amp;E) mission are the customized antennas used in the evaluation of navigation systems performance in challenging radio frequency (RF) environments including intentional (jamming) and unintentional interference.</p>
<p><br />SECTION 2 - PURPOSE OF RFI:</p>
<p>This notice is issued for the purpose of identifying potential sources capable of providing unique and ruggedized antennas such as those described in Section 3. The Government intends to use information gathered from industry to gain awareness of capabilities, determine interested parties, and support the formulation of an acquisition strategy and for market research aspects.</p>
<p><br />SECTION 3 - SCOPE OVERVIEW:</p>
<p>The 746th Test Squadron is seeking sources that are capable of designing and manufacturing ruggedized lightweight antennas for open air RF propagation in support of GPS test programs. Of interest are sources capable of proposing innovative antenna designs with supporting analysis. The 746th Test Squadron is seeking antenna designs that produce consistent patterns easily modelled with minimized energy propagated outside the main beam. The sources of interest are capable of rapid development (&lt;3 months) of a near production ready prototype antenna for evaluation and capability to produce up to ten production units within a year.<br />The 746 Test Squadron requires different types of antennas that are ruggedized, able to operate in all-weather conditions, light (less than 25 pounds in weight), able to transmit for 12 continuous hours at a maximum input power of 1500 W (non-pulsed) without signal degradation and 3000 hour lifespan when transmitting at the rated power handling, and have mounting points for pole connection. Input connector should be a 7/16-FEMALE DIN connector.</p>
<p>Weather conditions include precipitation (rain and snow), blowing dust/sand/dirt, wind gusts up to 35 mph, in ambient temperatures of 20-120 &deg;F and is UV resistant.</p>
<p>Ruggedized means that they would be able to be transported on unprepared roads to remote locations traveling 60 mph when placed in a truck bed, require no delicate handling during install and tear down, and have recessed connectors to mitigate damage during handling and transportation, or include a mount for the antenna.</p>
<p>Below is a sampling of different types of antennas the unit is interested in.</p>
<p>1) 30 x 30: This antenna would have a 30&deg; beam width azimuth and elevation (30 and 30 El), +/- 3&deg; with standing wave ratio of less than 2 and be symmetric about the bore-sight when transmitting. The antenna would be able to provide jamming at two frequencies, L1 (1575.42 Mhz) and/or L2 (1227.60 MHz) with a 100 MHz bandwidth RHCP (Right-Hand Circular Polarization). Back lobe suppression shall have a greater than 28 dB front to back (F/B) ratio and side lobe suppression a greater than 23 dB front to side (F/S) ratio. The antenna's gain shall be at least 14 dBiC. The 30 x 30 requirements listed above should be met for the rated power handling of 1500 W non-pulsed. The antenna shall be approximately smaller 22 inches in width by 24 inches in length.</p>
<p>2) 60 x 60: This antenna would have a 60&deg; beam width azimuth and elevation (60Az and 60 El), +/- 3&deg; with a standing wave ratio of less than 2 and be symmetric about the bore-sight when transmitting. The antenna would be able to provide jamming at two frequencies, L1 (1575.42 Mhz) and/or L2 (1227.60 MHz) with a 100 MHz bandwidth RHCP (Right-Hand Circular Polarization). Back lobe suppression would be greater than 28 dB front to back (F/B) ratio and side lobe suppression a greater than 23 dB front to side (F/S) ratio. The antenna's gain would be at least 8 dBiC. The 30 x 30 requirements listed above should be met for the rated power handling of 1500 W non-pulsed. The antenna would smaller approximately 12 inches in width by 20 inches in length.</p>
<p>3) Omnidirectional: This antenna would have a 110&deg; beam width or greater, with a standing wave ratio of less than 2 and be symmetric about the bore-sight when transmitting. The antenna would be able to provide jamming at two frequencies, L1 (1575.42 Mhz) and L2 (1227.60 MHz) with a 100 MHz bandwidth RHCP (Right-Hand Circular Polarization). The antenna's gain would be at least 5 dBiC. The omnidirectional requirements listed above should be met for the rated power handling of 1500 W non-pulsed. The antenna should be smaller, approximately 14 inches in width by 8 inches in length.</p>
<p><br />SECTION 4 - RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to submit a capability statement not to exceed 20 pages in length including any pictures, diagrams and other materials. If submitted electronically, all responses must be provided in a Microsoft Office or Adobe PDF format.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) Science and Mission Operations (SMO) support contract.  This is a follow-on to contract NAS2-97001, with Universities Space Research Association (USRA). <P> SOFIA is an airborne astronomical observatory consisting of a 2.5-m aperture telescope permanently installed in a specially modified Boeing 747SP aircraft. The observatory, with its open port telescope provided through a partnership with the German Aerospace Center (DLR), provides routine access to nearly all of the visible, infrared, far infrared, and sub-millimeter parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.  SOFIA's primary mission is to conduct high-quality, high-impact, cutting-edge research in astronomy, astrophysics, and planetary astronomy in a safe and cost effective manner.  The observatory is able to directly incorporate new or upgraded instruments over its lifetime. <P> The SOFIA Program is executed jointly at two NASA centers. Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) is responsible for flight operations and maintenance of the SOFIA aircraft. The aircraft is based in Palmdale, California.	Flight operations and maintenance are not within scope of this procurement. Program and science management is at Ames Research Center (ARC) at Moffett Field, California; ARC is also responsible for science support required onsite at AFRC.   Science support at AFRC that is within scope of this procurement includes maintenance of the SOFIA primary mirror-coating chamber and integration of science instruments onto the observatory.  <P> SOFIA consists of the observatory and mission support systems.	The observatory includes the Airborne System and the Science Instruments (both Facility Instruments for general observations, as well as Principal Investigator instruments). The Airborne System consists of the Aircraft, Telescope Assembly, and Mission Command & Control System.  The ground-based mission support systems include the SOFIA Science Center (SSC) at Ames, and the SOFIA Operations Center (SOC) located at the Armstrong Aircraft Operations Facility in Palmdale.  The SOC provides housing and maintenance capabilities for the observatory (including the mirror coating chamber) along with science instrument preparation and checkout facilities. <P> SOFIA conducts approximately 100 science flights and produces nominally 800 research hours annually. This translates to nominally 8 or more hours of science per flight, with a flight rate of approximately 3 nights per week, with several weeks per year dedicated to aircraft maintenance. <P> SOFIA carries out a science program defined by peer review of community-based observing proposals. Additionally, SOFIA guarantees observations for instrument developers and conducts a limited number of discretionary investigations defined by the SOFIA Science Mission Operations Director. <P> Long term plans anticipate the observatory could operate through May 2034. <P> The SMO support contract requirements are anticipated to include, but are not limited to, the following: <P> Manage, plan, and execute science and mission operations for SOFIA to meet NASA mission objectives including: <P> Perform the annual SOFIA Call For Proposals and Proposal solicitation and award processes for each yearly observation cycle, <P> Plan flight missions for each yearly observation cycle, <P> Provide qualified staff for the planning and execution of science mission operations consistent with a nominal and sustained flight rate of approximately 100 flights per year and nominally 3 flights per week during mission operations. Science missions fly only at night.	 <P> Top-level science flight duties for on-board SMO personnel typically include: <P>    Science Instrument Operator: Operate facility class instruments to acquire science data per awarded time of selected proposals, <P>    Mission Director:	Science/Flight/Observatory Team coordination, <P>    Telescope Operators: Science target acquisition, telescope operation,  <P> Execute science flight missions. Example duties are: <P>    Flight preparation of the science instrument(s), <P>    Pre/post flight check-out of on-board mission systems, <P>    Science flight plan development, extract science data and deliver to archive, <P>    Post-flight reports. <P> Provide qualified scientific staff to: <P> Plan and execute (for SMO staff and science targets) annual six-week southern hemisphere deployments to Christchurch, New Zealand. (NASA is responsible for overall planning for the deployment), <P> Operate and maintain SOFIAs suite of four facility science instruments, <P> Process and calibrate all facility instrument science data, <P> Manage the archive for all SOFIA science data, <P> Manage pipeline software for four facility science instruments, <P> Provide SOFIA Guest Investigator support, <P> Maintain reflectivity of the SOFIA Primary mirror (routine cleanings, re-coat if necessary), <P> Maintain and operate all science and mission operations equipment and software that are used in performing the SOFIA mission. Examples include: Observatory Simulation Labs, SOFIA Data Archive, Mirror Coating Facility, Flight Planning and Scheduling Tools, Science Instrument Laboratory, <P> Provide NASA with science and mission operations reports that assess performance to requirements, <P> Provide support to observatory improvement testing and observatory check-out, <P> Perform SOFIA science outreach and public engagement functions. <P> NASA/ARC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for SOFIA SMO Support Contract.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. <P> This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  <P> No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. <P> Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, or any category of small business, number of years in business.  <P> Responses must also include a one to five page (maximum) summary describing your organizations experience and capabilities to meet or exceed the stated anticipated requirements as they relate to providing science and mission operations support for the SOFIA program. <P> Responses are requested to include affiliate and customer information:	parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number). <P> ARC is soliciting suggestions on contracting approaches to this effort that will enhance competition and provide opportunities for small business. Therefore, we are also requesting feedback in any or all of the following areas for consideration during acquisition planning: 1. For small businesses that cannot perform the entire scope of effort stated above, indicate what portion(s) of this scope your company could perform. 2. Socio-economic considerations are a priority at ARC. Given the general scope of work stated above, please submit suggested percentages and types of the proposed requirements that could be subcontracted to each of the following types of businesses: Small Business concerns, Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) concerns, Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB) concerns, HUBZone Small Business concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) (includes other minority institutions), Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns. This information may be used to establish subcontracting goals for any future procurement. 3. Besides Past Performance and Price, what other evaluation factors, if any, do you believe should be included in the RFP, and why? 4. Does the selection of NAICS code 541712 seem appropriate? If not, what alternative NAICS code do you suggest, and why? 5. NASA support service contracts generally have a five-year period of performance. What combination of base period and options do you recommend for the duration of the contract, and why? <P> Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. <P> Information about major upcoming ARC procurement actions is available at <A HREF="http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eis/admin/admin.cgi?center=ARC">http://ec.msfc.nasa .gov/cgi-bin/eis/admin/admin.cgi?center=ARC </A>      .

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education's (the Department) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is conducting market research on Cloud Service Providers (CSP) that can host web sites in support of the OCIO's cloud strategy, support the Department's Administrative Communications System (ACS) cloud hosting directive, and bring the Department into compliance with the Digital Government Strategy with the following outcomes:
<p>&bull; Improved asset utilization and cost savings from a streamlined acquisition and implementation<br />&bull; Improved application development and management from a standard secure platform <br />&bull; Shifted focus from asset ownership to service management <br />&bull; Enabling access and migration to emerging technologies <br />&bull; Meeting diverse Department business needs for cloud computing service models such as Software as a Services (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)<br /><br />The Department's cloud-based web hosting plans seek to remedy low asset utilization, a fragmented demand for resources, duplicative systems, lack of website standardization, and environments which are difficult to manage and require long procurement lead times. The purpose of this document is to understand current best practices in Federal Cloud Hosting to support a potential future acquisition of a Cloud Service Provider (CSP).<br /><br />Cloud services sought by OCIO would host and serve some of the Department's public-facing websites and the current ED.gov infrastructures. The Department requires cloud services to be FedRAMP certified and able to be certified and accredited to Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements with a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 categorization of Moderate and comply with the security standards detailed in the FIPS 140-2. The Department is interested in vendors that can, or will in the next 12-24 months, support a FISMA High categorization and the security standards associated with this categorization.<br /><br />Please see the attached documents for the Information that the Department is requesting.</p>

<CONTACT>Dr Wilton T. Sanders, Astrophysics Explorer Program Scientist, Phone 202-358-1319, Fax 202-358-3062, Email wilton.t.sanders@nasa.gov

<a href="mailto:wilton.t.sanders@nasa.gov">Dr Wilton T. Sanders</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is releasing this Community Announcement concerning its intention to solicit investigations for the Astrophysics Explorer Program. The Astrophysics Explorer Program conducts Principal Investigator (PI)-led space science investigations to advance NASAs strategic goals in astrophysics, which are to discover the origin, structure, evolution, and destiny of the Universe and search for Earth-like planets. Additional information concerning these areas of investigation is provided through appropriate links found on the SMD homepage at <A HREF="http://science.nasa.gov/">http://science.nasa.gov/ </A>	. <p> The current state of planning calls for NASA SMD to release an Announcement of Opportunity (AO) in the late summer/early fall of 2016 that will solicit proposals for Medium Explorer (MIDEX) missions to accomplish Astrophysics Explorer Program science objectives. NASA also plans to release simultaneously a solicitation for Astrophysics Explorer Missions of Opportunity (MO) through the NASA Announcement of Opportunity NNH12ZDA006O, Second Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON-2). A draft MIDEX AO and draft SALMON-2 amendment are expected to be ready for release for comment in Spring 2016. <p> The PI-managed mission cost cap for an Astrophysics MIDEX mission is expected to be no greater than $250M in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 dollars, not including the cost of the Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) or any contributions. Standard launch services on an ELV will be provided for MIDEX missions at no charge against the mission cost cap. Only the launch services described in the Explorer Program Librarys launch services document will be provided (see <A HREF="http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/APMIDEX2016">http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/APMIDEX2 016 </A>   ). There will be a charge against the mission cost cap for mission unique and special launch services beyond the standard launch services offered.  <p> The PI-managed mission cost cap for an Astrophysics Explorer MO is expected to be no greater than $70M or $35M in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 dollars. NASA expects to solicit MO science investigations that are defined in the SALMON-2 AO as Partner MOs, New Missions using Existing Spacecraft MOs, or Small Complete Mission MOs, including investigations requiring flight on the International Space Station. Suborbital-class MOs have a $35M PI-managed mission cost cap; this includes missions on ultra-long duration balloons, suborbital reusable launch vehicles (RLVs), and CubeSats. Other (not suborbital-class) MOs will have a $70M PI-managed mission cost cap. <p> The currently approved Astrophysics Explorer Program planning budget is sufficient to select and execute one MIDEX mission and one MO. <p> The current planning is for the selection process to be done in two stages. In Step 1, it is anticipated that two or three MIDEX missions and one to three MO missions may be selected for nine-month Phase A concept studies. Each MIDEX concept study would be funded up to $2M in real year dollars, and each MO concept study would be funded up to $500K in real year dollars. For Step 2, NASA will conduct a detailed review of the Phase A concept study reports. As a result of this second evaluation, NASA expects to select one MIDEX mission and one MO mission to proceed into Phase B and subsequent mission phases. NASA desires to launch the MIDEX mission before the end of 2023. <p> Proposals in response to this AO will be due 90 days after its formal release. Participation will be open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S. organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, NASA Centers, and other Government agencies. <p> The schedule for the solicitation is intended to be:    Release of draft AO: Spring 2016 (target);    Release of final AO: Late summer/early fall 2016 (target);    Preproposal conference: ~ 3 weeks after final AO release;    Proposals due: 90 days after AO release;   Selection for competitive Phase A studies: Summer 2017 (target);    Concept study reports due: Summer 2018 (target);    Down-selection: Early 2019 (target). <p> The Astrophysics Explorer Program MIDEX AO and SALMON-2 amendment may contain provisions that differ substantially from this preliminary notice, in which case the provisions in the AO and SALMON-2 amendment will take precedence. The Astrophysics Explorer AO will be based on the Standard PI-led Mission AO Template available at <A HREF="http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/standardao/sao_templates.html">http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/ standardao/sao_templates.html </A>    . Proposers should read the Draft Astrophysics MIDEX AO and SALMON-2 amendment carefully when they are released. <p> NASA has not approved the issuance of the Astrophysics MIDEX AO or SALMON-2 amendment and this notification does not obligate NASA to issue the announcements and solicit proposals. Any costs incurred by prospective investigators in preparing submissions in response to this announcement are incurred completely at the submitter's own risk. <p> Further information will be posted on the Explorer Program Acquisition website at <A HREF="http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/APMIDEX2016">http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/APMIDEX2 016 </A>    as that information becomes available. Questions or comments about this intention to release an Astrophysics MIDEX AO may be addressed in writing or by E-mail to the Astrophysics Explorers Program Scientist: Dr. Wilton T. Sanders, Ref.: Astrophysics MIDEX AO, Astrophysics Division, Mail Stop 3U23, Science Mission Directorate, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546-0001,      E-mail: <a href="mailto:wilton.t.sanders@nasa.gov">wilton.t.sanders@nasa.gov </a>  (subject line to read "Astrophysics MIDEX AO"). Responses to all inquiries will be answered by E-mail and also posted weekly at the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) location of the Explorer Program Acquisition website; anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.

<DESC>NINDS EPILEPSY THERAPY SCREENING PROGRAM (ETSP)<br />FULL TITLE: "The Identification and Differentiation of Therapeutics to Prevent, Modify and Treat Pharmacoresistant Epilepsy for the NINDS Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program (ETSP)"
<p>PURPOSE OF NOTICE: <br />The purpose of this announcement is to identify and assess the availability of small business concerns with the requisite capabilities and qualifications to conduct multiple preclinical pharmacological evaluations of investigational compounds directed at identification of potential therapies to prevent, modify and treat epilepsy and related seizure disorders. On a limited basis the contractor may also perform model development and validation and conduct pharmacokinetic studies using normal or epileptic animals. The contract shall require the contractor to conduct studies in the following performance areas including, but not limited to: anti-seizure screening in acute and chronic seizure models, models of anti-epileptogeneis and disease modification, models of special epilepsy populations and genetic epilepsies, models and endpoints associated with recognized comorbidities of epilepsy and pharmacokinetic studies. Initial in vivo testing will routinely utilize male rodents but female rodents will also be required on specified candidate compounds. <br /><br />The envisioned contract award is a follow-on requirement to the current National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP) requirement currently being performed under NINDS contract HHSN271201100029C at the University of Utah, where the requirement has been performed since the inception of this program in 1975.<br /><br />The NINDS is seeking Small Business Capability Responses at this time in order to determine if this future follow-on requirement can be set-aside exclusively for small business concerns.<br /><br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, and if your business concern is NOT a small business concern, there is no need to respond to this announcement. Once a determination is made regarding the suitability of this future follow-on requirement for a small business set-aside (or an open competition to include both large and small businesses), a separate Pre-Solicitation Announcement will be issued in advance of the release of a Request for Proposals.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: <br />The NINDS Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program (ETSP), until recently known as the Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP), was established in 1975 as part of a larger Antiepileptic Drug Development (ADD) program that included basic and clinical research, and extra- and intramural components. The ASP arm was added to address a critical need for new anti-seizure medications and to promote industry interest in their development, and it is the only remaining component of the original ADD program today. <br />Since its inception, the program has been supported through a contract with the University of Utah, which NINDS initially awarded after open competitions in 1974, 1980 and 1984, and renewed thereafter on a sole-source basis.<br />The screening process involves researchers from academia and industry in the U.S. and abroad ("ETSP participants") submitting compounds to the ETSP for investigation in a series of animal (rodent) seizure models. These tests are performed blinded by the contract laboratory and on a confidential basis through a written agreement between the NINDS and the ETSP participant at no cost to the ETSP participant. The NINDS reports test results to participants and provides advice on future steps for promising compounds, while protecting confidentiality and intellectual property. Over 32,000 compounds have been screened to date, and the ASP has contributed to bringing 10 antiseizure drugs to market since 1990, with a major role in some and a minor role in others.<br />The ETSP was recently reviewed by Working Groups commissioned by the National Advisory Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NANDS) Council in 2011 and 2014. The Working Groups' recommendations were consistent in both reviews in favor of prioritizing the identification of treatments for drug refractory epilepsy, epileptogenesis, and disease modification over the identification of additional undifferentiated acute seizure drugs. The new name of the program is meant to emphasize that a major focus is going beyond the symptomatic treatment of seizures to identifying agents that have the potential to prevent their development. <br /><br />NAICS CODE and APPLICABLE SMALL BUSINESS QUALIFICATION: <br />Based on the nature and type of compound screening and testing that will be required under the proposed project and considering the ultimate objective of this program to provide a full range of preclinical pharmacological screening and testing for investigational compounds using models of brain dysfunction designed to identify possible new therapeutics that could be further developed as possible treatments for seizure related disorders, this requirement is best denoted as a research and development project and is best classified by North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) 541711, "Research and Development in Biotechnology". This is not a program management-type requirement, rather the contractor is expected to possess the expertise and resources to implement a broad range of applied preclinical pharmacological compound screening activity for epilepsy and related disorders. <br /><br />The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541711, "Research and Development in Biotechnology", is 500 or fewer employees. <br /><br />Furthermore, per FAR 19.001, a small business concern means any business entity organized for profit (even if its ownership is in the hands of a nonprofit entity) with a place of business in the United States or its outlying areas and that makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes and/or use of American products, material and/or labor, etc.. <br /><br />Small business concerns that meet the applicable NAICS code size standard and who believe that they have the capabilities, capacity, experience and qualifications to provide the full range of preclinical pharmacological investigational compound screening are asked to address each of the areas described in the Information Requested section below as part of a submitted Capability Statement. Please ensure that your response is complete and sufficiently detailed to assist in our evaluation as to whether or not this requirement could be set-aside for small business participation only. If your business is NOT a small business concern with regard to the aforementioned NAICS code, there is no need to respond to this announcement. If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns, the anticipated Request for Proposals may be set-aside for small business concern participation only and a future Pre-Solicitation Notice for this requirement would indicate this determination.<br /><br />Responses to this announcement must address how your business meets the applicable NAICS code size standard and must include the respondents' DUNS number; organization name; organization address; point of contact, including title, address, telephone, and e-mail address; and your current small business size status (e.g. small, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, 8(a), etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code specified above (NAICS 541711).</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED:<br />Small business concerns that meet the applicable NAICS code size standard and who believe that they have the expertise, experience and capacity to perform the compound screening studies described are asked to address each of the following items in your response to this Small Business Sources Sought Announcement as part of your submitted Capability Response:<br />1) Demonstrate evidence of proficiency in conducting studies with different rodent species by various routes of administration [oral gavage (p.o.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), subcutaneous (s.c.), and intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v.)] performed in acute and chronic seizure models as follows.

FRCSE is responsible for rework, repair, and overhaul of various Navy aircraft, engines, components, and ground support equipment. Many of the aircraft parts and components used throughout the maintenance process at FRCSE require routine cleaning to remove sludge and grime accumulated during the maintenance process.
  FRCSE utilizes several Parts Cleaning Machines to remove all sludge and grime from the aircraft parts and components. This requirement is for each Parts Cleaning Machine to be serviced/cleaned on a routine basis. The attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) identifies all machines by description, to include brand, model, and serial #, salient characteristics, quantity, as well as, location and required service frequency. The required services will be provided at FRCSE facilities located at Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville, FL and Naval Station (NS) Mayport, FL.

<DESC>The General Services Administration - Region 3 is contemplating a construction requirement in Kearneysville, West Virginia. This is a notice for sources sought only. This is not a request for proposal nor is it a pre-solicitation communication. It is a market research effort. There is no solicitation, specification or set of drawings available for this announcement. The Government shall use the results of this market research effort to augment its decision making process with regards to setting aside this and future acquisitions for small businesses. The order of magnitude for the contemplated acquisition is between $8,000,000.00 and $15,000,000.00. This announcement does not constitute a procurement commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise. No contract shall be awarded from this sources sought announcement. Response is strictly voluntary. No reimbursement shall be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified information.
<p>It is the policy of the Government to maximize practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small businesses. The purpose of this sources sought announcement is to gain additional knowledge of interested, capable and qualified small businesses concerns of all types. Said types include small business, veteran owned small business, service disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business and women owned small business concerns. For reference, general definitions of each small business concern type can be found in FAR 52.219-8 - Utilization of Small Business Concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236220. The applicable Size Standard is $36.5 million. A size standard, which is usually stated in number of employees or average annual receipts, represents the largest size that a business (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) may be to remain classified as a small business for SBA and federal contracting programs.</p>
<p>The scope of the project includes: approximately 120,000 square feet of interior renovations will be completed in 4 phases over 2 years; renovation of identified main building areas on multiple floors to accommodate the relocation / consolidation of employees; demolition and new construction in an existing tenant office space; raised access flooring, new/repaired gypsum partitions; paint, wall base, door frames and doors; door hardware; gypsum and acoustical lay in ceilings; millwork; mechanical work; fire protection work; telecommunication / security work, A/V work; electrical work, and site work.  Disposal of existing furniture and moves will also be included in contract.</p>
<p>If your firm believes that it can meet all of the requirements for this contemplated acquisition and is a small business concern of a type described above then please respond to this sources sought announcement. Your response should be submitted via fax, email or regular mail to the attention of Mr. Raymond J. Porter (raymondj.porter@gsa.gov) and Michael J. Toth (michael.toth@gsa.gov). Telephone inquiries which describe capabilities shall not be considered as a response to this sources sought announcement. Written responses must be received no later than 05:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time on January 4, 2015. The following information is requested as part of your response:</p>
<p>1. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) &amp; Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) information. This information can be obtained from your System for Award Management (SAM) registration at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>2. Name of your firm with address, phone, fax, email and current point of contact as appropriate.</p>
<p>3. Identify the type of your small business concern. See above for information on how to obtain definitions of each concern type.</p>
<p>4. Demonstrate ability to obtain a bid bond up to 20% of the maximum order of magnitude and performance and payment bonding to 100% of the maximum order of magnitude. The maximum order of magnitude is $15,000,000.00 for a single contract. This can be satisfied by obtaining your firm's bonding capability in the form of a letter from a Surety which demonstrates aggregate and per contract bonding upper limits.</p>
<p>5. Required experience to be considered a viable source for the contemplated acquisition includes contracts awarded to your firm as the general contractor for projects which involve managing multiple subcontractors, working in historically significant, occupied buildings, dealing with sensitive customers and coordinating work involving numerous construction disciplines. Projects of such a nature must be valued in the provided order of magnitude ($10,000,000.00 - $15,000,000.00) and have been completed in the past five (5) years. Your response should address experience with building out space to fit client specifications. Your response should address experience with installing fire alarm systems to include both hardware and software requirements. Work experience in the Kearneysville, West Virginia market and its surrounding vicinity should also be demonstrated in your response. Your response should document how it meets these requirements and must provide specific contract information to include: contract number, location, agency, dollar value (inclusive of all changes), a description of the work and a client point of contact for each award. Work performed as a subcontractor shall not be considered as evidence of capability to succeed as a prime contractor. Please limit your provided experience to five (5) completed awards which meet the above criteria.</p>
<p>6. Indicate whether your firm would submit a proposal in response to an RFP consistent with these requirements that was set aside for small business concerns whether as a general small business set aside or one tailored to your firms particular concern type.</p>
<p>The Government shall carefully consider all appropriately formatted responses to this sources sought announcement in its decision making process for the contemplated acquisition. Firms that fail to provide all of the required information will not be used to augment the Government's market research efforts. Again, this is a market research effort meant to assist the Government in its acquisition decision making process and does not constitute a solicitation or award commitment.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, ARS, WBSC intends to award a sole source procurement to:
<p>Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.<br />1380 Willow Road<br />Menlo Park, CA 94025-1439</p>
<p>for a PacBio Sequel DNA Analysis Instrument for producing long read sequences with related hardware and software components and three day training of operation.</p>
<p>The complete purchase will include:</p>
<p>1)  (100-426-900) PacBio Sequel System<br />2)  (100-609-000) Instrument grade UPS for Sequel System. 208 V, 50/60Hz<br />3)  (100-125-100) On-site System Training for Sequel (3 Days)</p>
<p>The PacBio Sequel System is covered by numerous patents owned by Pacific Biosciences. Pacific Biosciences is the only known vendor of the PacBio Sequel System and associated library preparation, polymerase, and sequencing reagents in the United States.</p>
<p>The system is unique in many aspects that are critical to genome assembly. This includes the ability to sequence DNA that has not been amplified by PCR. This helps in the reduction of errors and prevents redundancy which would impact overall output. The Sequel instrument can produce extremely long reads with an average of 8-12kb and as long as 40kb. In comparison, the Illumina platform can only produce 600 bp read lengths while the Roche 454 or Ion torrent produce variable read lengths of 200-1200 bp. The system can also detect base modifications such as DNA methylation. In general, with one SMART cell enough DNA sequence is obtained of length and amount that a whole genome assembly of a bacteria can be accomplished with few gaps, in most instances. This is achieved in part due to the long read lengths which help cover gaps missed by other technologies.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The equipment will be located at the USDA-ARS U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, NE.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on or about December 28, 2015. This Notice of Intent is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposals (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will consider all responses received by 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time, December 27, 2015. Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will only be accepted via mail/email to the following addresses:</p>

The FAA, under the authority of Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.2.4, makes its single-source determination based upon the existence of only one source that can fulfill the market surveys requirements of i) a demonstrated ability to produce the RVR, IAW Spec FAA-E-2272B SCN #2; ii) having a fully operational production line capable of producing RVR within four months after contract award, and iii) being able to produce two systems per month. Satisfying these requirements avoids disrupting NAS flight operations.

5.  Reasons for Single Source

The FAA conducted a Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) to determine the capability of industry to produce a PC-based Runway Visual Range (PC-RVR) system used for navigational purposes. The Market Survey was posted from October 20, 2014 through November 19, 2014 on the Federal Aviation Administration Contract Opportunities (FAACO) website using solicitation reference #18320.  

The Market Survey yielded three potential vendors, one of which is the incumbent. Analysis of provided vendor information and FAA communications and meetings with the three vendors revealed that only Vaisala has a navigational RVR product which is responsive to the FAA criteria listed in the Market Survey and which can be available for production without extensive effort by vendors to submit a first article for testing and approval. Vaisala has demonstrated its capability and production capacity under a previous competitively awarded contract which included the designing, building, and successful acceptance by the FAA of a first article PC-based RVR system and the subsequent delivery of 97 complete PC-based RVR systems, additional sensors, and spare parts.

Of the two other responding vendors, both required significant design and build efforts in excess of the production time requirement of the FAAs market survey criteria. Only Vaisala demonstrated that it possesses the manufacturing documentation to meet technical system conformance, special test equipment and tools, manufacturing personnel, and production floor space to initiate production activities within days after receiving an award, ensuring a production line capable of producing two systems per month beginning four months after award as required in the market survey.  

Based upon the market response, the FAA determined that purchase of the PC-RVR system from a single source, Vaisala, is necessary to maintain timely production quantities of the system and maintain the technical integrity of the NAS. The FAA needs to establish and sustain RVR systems in the NAS to continue supporting CAT I through III approaches.

Demonstrated skill in planning, monitoring and evaluation of optometry therapy in a clinical setting. Skill in managing optometry patients with exceedingly complex medical histories, including the very young and the very old. Ability to communicate with patients regarding optometric disease states, desired outcomes and laboratory tests, proper administration, use, actions and precautions. Skill in adhering to optometry primary care acute and chronic care protocols recording all information in the patient's medical record. Evaluation and Oversight: The Supervisory Optometry Officer provides general administrative direction and oversight. The optometrist works independently in a facility without direct access to other eye care professionals. The optometrist will receive professional and technical direction from the supervisory optometrist, consulting ophthalmologist and eye care professions. The optometrist is a recognized professional optometry expert for the health facility and lead of the Arapahoe Clinic program. As such, decisions and recommendations are almost always accepted. Only those broad policy issues and optometry program goals and objectives are referred to the Chief of Optometry and/or Clinical Services Administrator for final decisions. The optometrist exercises independent latitude in planning and carrying out optometric direct health care assignments. The optometrist consults with other members of the medical staff on an as needed basis to develop the best treatment plan for optometry patients. The majority of work is not reviewed at the time the care is provided. The optometrist is responsible for carrying out department objectives with clarification form the Optometry Chief as needed. The optometrist is fully responsible for keeping the Optometry Chief informed of potentially controversial matters that may have far reaching implications or actions of a precedent setting nature. Completed work is reviewed and evaluated on the basis of the overall effectiveness and compatibility in providing clinical optometry services. Guidelines: Guidelines available include DHHS, PHS, IHS, Billings Area, Service Unit and Medical staff regulations, policies, procedures and bylaws. In addition, traditional and currently accepted optometric practices are available in the form of a specialty consultation, professional literature, journals, and textbooks. In nearly all cases, however, the optometrist's judgment is the key factor in determining whether guidelines are to be adhered to or deviated from or whether new guidelines need to be developed to protect the interests of the patients. Complexity: Duties are complex in that the nature of eye disease encountered differ widely from patient to patient and requires accurate diagnosis. Assignments in addition to the full range of primary eye care include evaluation of complicated eye emergencies with little or no technical guidance. The optometrist serves as a consultant on eye emergencies and is responsible for developing a full treatment regimen including consultation as indicated. Scope and Effect: The professional services affect the well-being of the patients served and the health status of the community on a broad basis. Personal Contacts: Personal contacts are with patients, patient's families, co-workers, vendors; representatives of federal, state and tribal health organizations, subordinates, administrators and physicians. These contacts are made with individuals and groups in moderately unstructured settings. Purpose of Contacts: The contact with patients is to provide optometric services. With co-workers, it is for consultation, program development or to gain administrative support. With contract vendors, contact is to gain professional or technical services that the optometrist cannot directly provide to the patients. Physical Demands: Work requires sitting, standing and movement between multiple exam rooms. Occasional lifting is required especially when moving equipment for community screenings. Pediatric screenings often include days where multiple hours include bending to be at eye level with patients in order to exam their eye function and health. Electronic Health Record recordkeeping requires typing exam information into individual patient health record. Work Environment: Work is performed in a normal optometric office setting. There are two clinics at the Service Unit and the optometrist may be assigned to work at either clinic depending on workload demands and is at the discretion of the Chief Optometrist.<br /><br />SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

United States Coast Guard (CG-91)

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the technical, economic and financial feasibility of four landfill gas to energy projects and one solar energy project at five sites in Brazil..</p>
<p>With 41.5 MW installed power production capacity, Solv&iacute; Valoriza&ccedil;&atilde;o Energ&eacute;tica ("Solvi"), the study's Grantee, is the industry leader in landfill energy projects in Brazil.  The company successfully utilizes landfill gas energy to produce electricity for the Brazilian electric grid, while at the same time reducing landfill greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The study will assess the feasibility of landfill gas-to-energy production with gas engine-generator sets at four designated landfill sites under Solvi's management that have now reached maturity, the development of anaerobic bioreactors at these sites to enhance the methane yield, the development of state-of-the-art gas conditioning systems for the landfills, and finally, the feasibility and conceptual design for a solar cap system and/or traditional photovoltaic system at a fifth site.  The four sites are located in the Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul, Par&aacute; and S&atilde;o Paulo and it is estimated that their total current power generation is 10 megawatts (MW).  The lifetime of these landfills is estimated to be 20 years, and the sites are expected to continue producing sufficient methane for power generation for an additional four to seven years after closure.</p>
<p>At a fifth site in Salvador, Bahia the study will assess the feasibility and prepare a conceptual design for a solar power generation system. The study should consider a photovoltaic solar array co-located with the landfill, as well as a solar cap system. The solar cap will consist of an exposed geomembrane cover affixed with amorphous thin film solar cells.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $590,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>

<p>The CAS Division provides INL the means to manage these financial and contract functions by supporting and interfacing with the relevant entities within the Bureau (Regional and Functional Program Offices, other Divisions within INL/RM), as well as with Embassy staff and appropriate elements within the interagency. The Division is comprised of professionals with expertise in program management, financial management and contract management who serve on specific program and project teams.

Irrigating and Fertilizing - The contractor will be provided with an irrigation schedule and shall be expected to irrigate each cell completely according to the schedule (Figure 3).  The contractor will be required to complete irrigation tracking sheets, check the pump for oil, check the gauges, ensure proper operation is maintained, keep a fuel tank record, order fuel when needed, receive fertilizer when delivered and apply fertilizer through the fertigation system.  

Routine Pump Maintenance - The contractor shall be responsible for performing basic pump maintenance, evaluating when more involved maintenance is required, and immediately notifying the project manager and maintenance team.

Cleaning the Rock Structure Screen System - The contractor shall access the rock structure screen system by either using a row boat or wading into the water after drawing down the Beal Ditch in both the east (Pump and Irrigation Reservoir) and west side embayment (Figure 2). Draw down is performed by closing the inlet gates and valves at the Topock Marsh/Beal Ditch connection, pumping the water to irrigate the cells, and scrubbing each of the eight wedge-wire screens with a stiff-bristled brush. This task takes approximately 1 hour, and is scheduled every other week unless otherwise directed by the Project Manager.

Additionally, if a Conservation Area road becomes difficult to navigate or impassible the project manager must be notified.

Manual Removal of Vegetation - Arrow weed and other vegetation tend to encroach on the roadways and walkways, grow around the irrigation valves, and spread along the top and embankments of the rock structure.  The contractor shall keep the roadways, walkways, irrigation valves and rock structure clear of vegetation for safety purposes due to common sightings of rattlesnakes in such locations  The contractor shall come prepared with loppers, a weed-wacker, a shovel, and other desired tools to manage thick vegetation in undesirable areas.

Irrigating and Fertilizing - The contractor will be provided with an irrigation schedule and shall be expected to irrigate each cell completely according to the schedule (Figure 3).  The contractor will be required to complete irrigation tracking sheets, check the pump for oil, check the gauges, ensure proper operation is maintained, keep a fuel tank record, order fuel when needed, receive fertilizer when delivered and apply fertilizer through the fertigation system.  

Routine Pump Maintenance - The contractor shall be responsible for performing basic pump maintenance, evaluating when more involved maintenance is required, and immediately notifying the project manager and maintenance team.

Cleaning the Rock Structure Screen System - The contractor shall access the rock structure screen system by either using a row boat or wading into the water after drawing down the Beal Ditch in both the east (Pump and Irrigation Reservoir) and west side embayment (Figure 2). Draw down is performed by closing the inlet gates and valves at the Topock Marsh/Beal Ditch connection, pumping the water to irrigate the cells, and scrubbing each of the eight wedge-wire screens with a stiff-bristled brush. This task takes approximately 1 hour, and is scheduled every other week unless otherwise directed by the Project Manager.

Checking Berms and Roads  Each field of the Beal Lake Riparian Area is separated from adjacent fields by built-up borders or berms.  These berms allow each cell to be independently flood irrigated.  The contractor shall be responsible for walking the perimeter of the fields being irrigated and checking the berms for blow outs.  In the event a berm is breached, the project manager must be notified immediately.  Additionally, if a Conservation Area road becomes difficult to navigate or impassible the project manager must be notified.

Manual Removal of Vegetation - Arrow weed and other vegetation tend to encroach on the roadways and walkways, grow around the irrigation valves, and spread along the top and embankments of the rock structure.  The contractor shall keep the roadways, walkways, irrigation valves and rock structure clear of vegetation for safety purposes due to common sightings of rattlesnakes in such locations  The contractor shall come prepared with loppers, a weed-wacker, a shovel, and other desired tools to manage thick vegetation in undesirable areas.

<DESC>Shimadzu Equipment Service Contract Questions
1.	What is the correct serial number for line item 27?
The correct serial number is L20234953373

2.	Are consumable items for the Shimadzu equipment are to be included with the contract?
This is for an all-inclusive service contract. My end user has not identified any consumables. However, if you feel you are conducting any routine maintenance whether it be monthly or quarterly in which you need any consumables, then your pricing should include that cost.

3.	Is the term "HOOD" just a location designation or if it is some sort of fume hood that needs to be serviced as well?
The term hood is more of a location term and will not be serviced with this contract.

<p><br /><strong>FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS</strong><br />Provide a complete price list for the following food &amp; beverage requirements. These requirements are an estimate and we will select items from the catering menu provided.</p>
<p>**Each day, most of our participants will eat lunch in the hotel restaurant or off-site. Many do choose to eat in the hotel restaurant, so please staff the restaurant accordingly from Tuesday to Thursday. In addition to those participants eating in the restaurant or off-site, we have several working meetings scheduled throughout our event with 8-30 participants each. For these instances, we would like to offer participants the ability to order self-pay meals beforehand that will be delivered or picked up by participants. If lunches are to be picked up by participants, we will need several pay stations operating to ensure that working lunch meeting participants can pay for lunches quickly and have ample time to meet. We have typically offered box lunches with a pre-order form. The pre-order form contains five options or a menu that varies each day. Participants can order in advance and turn their form in by 9:30 or 10:00 am so that the kitchen can prepare orders. A combination of salads and sandwiches with sides work well for our group.</p>

<p><br /><strong>FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS</strong><br />Provide a complete price list for the following food &amp; beverage requirements. These requirements are an estimate and we will select items from the catering menu provided.</p>
<p>**Each day, most of our participants will eat lunch in the hotel restaurant or off-site. Many do choose to eat in the hotel restaurant, so please staff the restaurant accordingly from Tuesday to Thursday. In addition to those participants eating in the restaurant or off-site, we have several working meetings scheduled throughout our event with 8-30 participants each. For these instances, we would like to offer participants the ability to order self-pay meals beforehand that will be delivered or picked up by participants. If lunches are to be picked up by participants, we will need several pay stations operating to ensure that working lunch meeting participants can pay for lunches quickly and have ample time to meet. We have typically offered box lunches with a pre-order form. The pre-order form contains five options or a menu that varies each day. Participants can order in advance and turn their form in by 9:30 or 10:00 am so that the kitchen can prepare orders. A combination of salads and sandwiches with sides work well for our group.</p>

VENDOR QUESTION(S)

1. QUESTION: What is the average number of miles traveled for ALS calls within the 40 mile radius annually?

RESPONSE: The Omaha VAHCS has estimated the amount of ALS trips to be approximately 350 trips per year. This number was derived from prior year requests and slightly increased based upon the anticipated number of new patients enrolled at the Omaha VAHCS. This is an ESTIMATED figure and is not a guarantee of the number of trips to be requested. Trips will be requested on an as-needed basis and are dependent upon patient need.

NOTE: The figures contained in the "Estimated Quantity per Year" column of the Price/Cost Schedule are rough estimates based upon prior year figures to include a slight increase for new patient enrollment and cannot be relied on as the final number. The actual quantity ordered can and will vary depending on patient need. 

2. QUESTION: What is the average number of miles traveled for BLS calls within the 40 mile radius
annually?

RESPONSE: The Omaha VAHCS has estimated the amount of BLS trips to be approximately 1,600 trips per year. This number was derived from prior year requests with a slight increase based upon the anticipated number of new patients enrolled at the VAHCS. This is an ESTIMATED figure and is not a guarantee of the number of trips to be requested. Trips will be requested on an as-needed basis and are dependent upon patient need.

NOTE: The figures contained in the "Estimated Quantity per Year" column of the Price/Cost Schedule are rough estimates based upon prior year figures to include a slight increase for new patient enrollment and cannot be relied on as the final number. The actual quantity ordered can and will vary depending on patient need.

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: David reynolds Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 240-3198 Email: david.w.reynolds.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required.

***********************
Updated 16 Dec 2015:

In addition to the infrared camera as discussed below, the FAA is seeking industry input on a potential replacement for the complete Long Range Sensor Suite System (to include IR camera, EO camera, and Pan/Tilt Platform) utilized in the northern border RVSS. The northern border RVSS currently utilizes the L3 Nighthawk HP Long Range EO/IR Surveillance System (see attached item/system description).  Any replacement system must be comparable to the L3 Nighthawk HP system in form, fit, and function.  

***********************
This is a market survey for potential replacement infrared (IR) cameras to be used in the northern border Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) in support of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.
   
At this time the nature of any potential competition has not been determined.  If a need materializes, the FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest, capabilities, and rough orders of magnitude from all businesses that are interested in and capable of providing the replacement RVSS IR cameras.  This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the potential acquisition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and size standards for this effort:

NAICS		Size Standard
334310		750 Employees

The contractor will supply personnel and resources necessary to provide the required IR cameras.  The northern border RVSS currently utilizes L3 WALRSS HD IR cameras (see attached item description).   CBP and FAA are currently seeking industry input for a potential replacement northern border RVSS IR camera.  The FAA is seeking information and capability of both cooled and uncooled cameras for this application.  Any potential replacement camera solution will need to be comparable to the L3 WALRSS HD IR camera in form, fit, and function.     

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

The FAA requires the following (limited to 30 pages) from interested vendors in accordance with this announcement: 

1. Capability Statement - This document should identify: 
      - Type of supplies and services provided by your firm
      - Size and type of supplies/services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance)                                
      - Number of years in business

2.  Clearly state whether or not you can provide all of the types of supplies required. 

3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

4.  Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) or budgetary estimate for the replacement IR camera.

All responses to this market survey must be received by 4:00 p.m. CST, 24 December 2015.  The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following: 

Email: robert.lafollette@faa.gov

RFQ No. P16PS00194

The National Park Service, Redwood National and State Parks, located in Humboldt and Del Norte County, California has a requirement for the removal and replacement of an existing asphalt shingle roof, skylights, and drywall ceiling of the restroom/shower house building at the Wolf Creek Education Center.

The work includes providing and installing roofing, tube style skylights, and ceiling drywall on one building. The restroom building will require the old asphalt shingle roofing (approximately 1,082 square feet), four skylights, and ceiling drywall (approximately 800 square feet) to be removed and recycled. Roof sheeting will need to be installed to cover existing skylight openings, sheeting will also need to be replaced in any damaged or rotten areas affected by water intrusion. Upon installation of new standing seam metal roof and eight 22" tube style skylights, according to manufacturers guidelines, drywall ceiling will be installed and finished in-kind. All work shall be performed under a single, fixed price contract. The anticipated period of performance is February 1, 2015 to May 1, 2016. Period of performance is approximate; actual dates will be established at the time of award.

This acquisition is set-aside exclusively for Total Small Business Concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238160; the small business size standard is $15.0 million.

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from the Request for Quotations (RFQ) to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

The RFQ will be available via electronic commerce only and may be accessed on or about December 16, 2015 at either FBO: http://www.fbo.gov or FedConnect: https://www.fedconnect.net. The prospective Offeror is responsible for periodically checking these websites for any amendments that may be issued prior to the closing date of the RFQ.

A Site Visit will be scheduled for approximately Tuesday, January 5, 2016 beginning at 9 a.m. PT. See Section L of the RFQ (when issued) for more information.

<p>Ensure you submit your proposals electronically as email attachments, and send them early enough to arrive in our in-box by the deadline on Wednesday, January 13, 2016. Remember, sometimes emails can take a while to arrive at their destination. Send the emails early enough. And, do not make the emails too large.

In addition, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to establish a competitive range of one or more offerors and to conduct further negotiations concerning price and other terms before awarding a contract, or to award the contract based upon initial proposals received without holding discussions. You are encouraged to make your proposal competitive.</p>
<p>You are also cautioned against any collusion with other potential offerors with regard to price proposals to be submitted. The RFP does not commit the American Consulate General Frankfurt to make any award. The Consulate General Frankfurt may cancel this RFP, or any part of it.</p>
<p>All questions regarding this solicitation shall be submitted in writing to FrankfurtRPSO@state.gov; (copy to JacobsenW@State.gov).</p>

DCAA's requirement for cellular services is to support the Agency's mobile auditors which are located throughout CONUS and OCONUS. Our auditors need to be supported to allow for mobility to contractor's sites to perform mission essential Department of Defense (DoD) audits. DCAA's requirement is for cellular service and devices with the largest third and fourth generation / long term evolution (3G-4G LTE) infrastructure. DCAA currently has deployed the Blackberry devices, Mobile Broadband Cards, cellular phone, and MIFI hot spots to its employees.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1.	ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
VA251-16-AP-1016	1A. PROJECT/TASK No. N/A	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$20,538
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
CARINAiso with Dicom includes; AIO medical grade touchscreen interface, Windows 7 Software-$11,200, CARINA wall mount kit-$750, DORADO MCB Replacement Kits (3)-$4,185, Sales and installation- $4,250, freight-$153. Total cost of $20,538.

The VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System requests to purchase a CARINAiso with Dicom System to replace an older Lap Windows XP system, plus upgrade existing lasers (3) with DORADO MCB replacement kits for patient marking. These lasers are used to mark patients for radiation treatment

Delivery Date: December 22, 2015

LAP of America, LLC, 161 Commerce Rd., Boynton Beach, FL 33426.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
The LAP Laser CARINAiso system is a highly specialized patient marking system. This system allows for marking three point isocenters on patients to be used as reference points when aligning patients for radiation treatment for their cancer.  The properties of the device and software are uniquely tailored for this application.  To request complete replacement of the existing patient marking system would require replacement of the computer, software, as well as the three mounted lasers resulting in a substantial increase in cost vs. upgrading.   The use of LAP Laser in this acquisition is essential to meeting the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product by another company.
The old system operates on Windows XP, which is no longer supported by Microsoft. Upgrading the operating system to Windows 7 will make it compliant. The VA and veterans receive a benefit as the laser system is utilized to mark isocenter on patients for the purpose of aligning them each day for their treatment. 
The minimum upgrade required to be compliant is being requested. The vendor is only offering a Windows 7 solution that involves an associated hardware upgrade.  The old software and hardware will not run in a Windows 7 environment.


4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
LAP of America Laser Applications L.L.C. is the only vendor capable of providing the supplies and services as described. This is an upgrade to an existing LAP laser system.
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market research was not conducted as Lap of America is the only vendor capable of meeting the requirements as this is a replacement/upgrade to an existing system. Consideration was given to request replacement of the entire system, however, that would require replacement of the entire system in the CT/SIM suite which includes; computer interface, software and three lasers. Two of which are floor mounted and one ceiling mounted.  This would result in an increase in cost, as well as the amount of construction needed to replace the entire system.  Additionally, LAP Lasers are utilized in our two linear accelerator vaults, which also raised compatibility concerns, as well as additional cost concerns for replacing systems in the vaults.

6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.
