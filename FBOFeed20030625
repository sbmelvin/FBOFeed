While price is certainly an important consideration, we will also be heavily considering offeror’s delivery schedules as well, so please submit your offer accordingly.  Features and specifications of the equipment will also be considered of course, as well as warranty terms.
We at MacDill contracting/LGCB are becoming more experienced with utilizing the numerous federal contractual vehicles which are available for Information Technology (I.T.) products.  GSA schedules are recommended to us by the Department of Defense (DoD).  While we still invite GSA offers, we realize that there are many other contractual vehicles (GWAC’s) which may offer advantages over GSA, and we would like to be aware of  these alternatives as well.

FAR 13.5 Test - Basis for Award, This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing simplified procedures authorized by FAR 13.5, “Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.”  For quotations determined technically acceptable, a trade-off between price and past performance will be conducted.  An offeror will be determined technically acceptable if no exception is taken to the specifications and requirements of the RFQ.  Award will be based on both price and past performance.  Each offeror’s quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.  Price will always be an important factor; therefore, offerors should make diligent efforts to control costs and submit fairly priced quotes.  Past performance will be evaluated based on relevancy (size/scope/complexity), quality of product/service, timeliness of delivery/performance and business relations (customer service).  To be considered for award, an offeror must have a satisfactory or better past performance record based upon information available to the contracting officer, and offer a reasonable price.  For past performance evaluation, the contractor shall include information concerning all relevant contracts/purchase orders for the same or similar service performed within the last five years (Government or Commercial).  For each contract/purchase order, information submitted should contain at least a contract number, whether or not you were the prime or subcontractor, the total contract amount, point of contact and telephone numbers.  Successful performance will be validated through interviews and/or correspondence with previous customers of the contractor.  Past performance should demonstrate as a minimum, customer satisfaction and satisfactory quality of services.  For price evaluation, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.  Price will be evaluated for reasonableness and realism.   Prices will be determined to be fair and reasonable based on competitor’s bids, current market conditions, and comparison to the government estimate, if applicable.  Technical capability requirements will be satisfied with the submission of a position description of all on-site personnel to perform elevator maintenance on Altus Air Force Base.  The position description should include as a minimum, years of experience or experience levels, and any certificates from schools or training courses for elevator repair and maintenance.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 13 and the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The government intends to acquire on a sole source to Nittany Scienticic, Inc. 1733 West 12600 South, Suite 420, Riverton, UT 84065. This announcement constitutes the ONLY solicitation; quotes are being requested and A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  Solicitation number RFQ N00244-03-T-0791 applies.  The North American Classification System Code 511210 and the business size 500  The agency is in need of fabrication of a low-profile omnidirectional ultra-wideband antenna, with specialized electrical and mechanical features.  The antenna will have a height not exceeding 25 cm and will be constructed of lightweight materials such as aluminum and teflon. Resisti ve elements may be used to reduce the vswr at lower frequencies, rendering the transmitting antenna "transmitter-safe" (with the vswr < 3) regardless of the operating frequency.  The resistive elements, if used, must be a removable, yet integral part of the structure.  Engineering techniques should be used for enhancing the mechanical properties, including that the lower portion of the antenna may be reinforced with an aluminum structure to support the antenna mounts ("legs") and prevent vibration of the bottom plate.  The antenna may use rivets for improving electrical connection between the feed structure and the radiating elements, and additional connecting elements such as top and bottom caps flush to the top and bottom radiating elements, to allow attachment via screws for tighter mechanical fit and better electrical connection.  Project is for the Naval Postgraduate  School, Monterey, CA  A non-competitive procurement is anticipated utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Anticipated award date id 30 June 2003.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center - San Diego (SSC-SD) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract to Observ Technologies Inc. of 400 Blvd. Jean Lesage, Suite 201 Quebec City, Canada G1K8W1, on a sole source basis. The purpose of this action is to procure spare parts for a night imaging system, ATV-2000i, from the contractor Observ Technologies Inc., OTI. The ATV-2000i is a night imaging system utilizing a laser illuminator, zoom lens, image intensified camera, target geo-referencing system, computer, infrared spotting camera, and operator control panel all integrated and operated together to form a seamless integrated night imaging system.  The spare parts to be procured under this contract are the Laser Module (pulsed time gated by the computer and synchronized with the intensified camera at CCD line video rates), Zoom Optical Elements (specially packaged to be mechanical and electronically integrated with the ATV system), Geo-reference Module, the Computer Console, and the Main Electronics.   The spare parts must be procured from OTI to insure compatability and interoperabililty with the ATV-2000i system, a proprietary design of OTI.  Use of any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs not recoverable through competition. The total estimated dollar value associated with this procurement is $157,360.00, which includes shipping of the parts to SSC-SD. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. See Notes 22 and 26. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334511 and the size standard is 750. Contracting officers will transmit the actual request for proposal to the potential sole source contractor by means other than posting it on the SPAWAR E-CC Business Opportunities

<DESC>This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts.  One of the contracts will be set-aside for a qualified 8(a) firm, provided a proposal is submitted, price and technical factors considered.  The remaining contracts will be made to the firms considered to be the Best Value and will be competed UNRESTRICTED.  Any qualified 8(a) business concern may compete for one of the unrestricted contracts, as well as for the single contract reserved for 8(a).  However, only one contract award per firm is allowed.  Contracts will be awarded to the responsible proposers whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  Price evaluation preference for the unrestricted competition will be given to HUBZone Small Business concerns, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4.  This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction and repair by design-build or (to a lesser extent) design-bid-build of waterfront facilities at various locations within the Southwest Division Area of Responsibility including, but not limited to, California, Oregon, and Washington.  However, it is anticipated the majority of the work will be performed in Southern California.  The work will be for new construction, repair, alteration, and renovation, by design-build or design-bid-build, dredging and disposal, demolition, and construction related operations, both in and above water; of waterfront facilities, such as, but not limited to:  piers, wharves, quay walls, bulkheads, sea wall, dry docks, boat ramps, docks and marinas, shore protection, rip rap, breakwaters, wave attenuation, mooring dolphins, buoys, primary and secondary fendering, pile driving, sheet piles, and dredging and disposal.  The work also includes the design and construction of all utilities and other facilities in the waterfront area and/or related to waterfront operations, to support Navy vessels and port operations.  The North American Industry Code Standard is 237990 and the annual size standard is $28.5 million.  In support of design-build strategies, each Offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (A-E) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract.  Offerors may offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s).  The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s) (A-E), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project.  After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  Should any of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders.  The basic contract period will be for 12 months.  Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months or a value of $50 million, whichever occurs first.  The task order range for this contract is between $500,000 and $10,000,000.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $25,000 is guaranteed to be ordered to each awardee.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Selection for award will be based evaluation of the following:  Factor 1 - Past Performance of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 2 – Support of Small Business (Applicable to the unrestricted competition only); Factor 3 - Experience of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 4 – Technical Approach; and Factor 5 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  For the unrestricted competition, when the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 combined are significantly more important than price.  For the 8(a) reserve competition, when the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, 3 combined are significantly more important than price. The recommended subcontracting goals for the contract value (base and all options periods) are as follows:  8% - Woman-Owned Small Business; 10% - Small Disadvantaged Business; 3% - HUBZone Small Business; 3% - Veteran-Owned Small Business; 3% - Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; 1% - Utilization of Locally-Owned Small Business (for work in remote areas); - and 27% Other Small Business.  Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  Proposed Task Order (PTO) 0001 is to provide all labor and materials necessary for all labor, materials and equipment necessary for the removal of existing creosote treated timber fender system, removal of bottom debris and pile stubs, installation of recycled plastic piles and concrete filled fiberglass piles, installation of recycled plastic pile corner protection fender systems, installation of face panels on the concrete fender piles and all incidental related work.  This PTO is representative of the projects that may be procured through this contract.  The estimated price range for Task Order 0001 is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to award a single contract for the performance of the Proposed Task Order identified in the RFP ("Proposed Task Order 0001") only.  The Government reserves the right not to award the Proposed Task Order 0001.  A site visit may be scheduled at a later date.  A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for 17 July 2003 at 1:00 p.m. sharp.  The conference will be held at 1220 Pacific Highway, Building 127, Room 139 (Blue Room), San Diego, California 92132.

<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Atmospheric Observing Systems (AOS), 8022 Countryside Park #234, Niwot, CO 80503 to provide thirteen portable, battery powered atmospheric air samplers.  The air samplers must be lightweight (less than 12kg) so it is portable for a person of average strength.  They must accommodate two 2.5 L sample containers (40cm length by 11 cm diameter) and automatically flush them in series at 5 L/min (STP) then pressurize them to 2 to 10 psig (user-adjustable) at elevations up to 12,000 feet, and the air stream must be filtered to remove particles larger than 7 microns.  The air samplers must have a built-in condenser that cools the sampled air stream to 5 degrees C while operating at an ambient temperature of 35 degrees C, and a "dry cycle" to purge water from the condenser.  Once fully charged, the sampler's battery must provide sufficient power for 3 sampling cycles, and the operator must be able to replace the battery in the field.  The samplers must also have flow and voltage meters.  Finally, the samplers cannot affect the composition of air stream to a measurable degree (determined by the measurement precision of CMDL Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases group analytical systems for carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, molecular hydrogen, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, and carbon and oxygen isotopes of carbon dioxide).****This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000).

Headline copy is reversed to white.  All text pages print as Black type matter and screened headline boxes only.  Some of the pages bleed.  Very heavy ink coverage is required on the covers and the contractor must take any and all necessary precautions to prevent ghosting and lay a smooth, uniform ink film.  Ghosting & “in-line problems” shall not be acceptable.  Text signatures must be printed on a lithographic printing press capable of printing the complete color bar as specified.  Do not assume “perfecting” is acceptable to the government.  The inspector shall use the following criteria to determine acceptability.  If the inspector is unable to determine by examination which side is first down then press perfecting is acceptable.  Web run production equipment if used, shall be lithographic heat-set only. COATING: Overall aqueous coat, satin finish, outside cover pages 1 and 4 only.  Dull varnish is not acceptable as an option to aqueous coating.  MARGINS: Bleeds, follow trim marks on furnished camera copy.  DISPLAY EXAMINATION: Examination of the camera copy is an integral part of these specifications.  No additional payment will be allowed due the contractor’s failure to examine the copy and thoroughly understand the nature and extent of the work to be performed.  PRESS SHEET INSPECTION: Press sheets shall be inspected at the contractor’s printing facility for quality conformance.  Each press sheet form must contain one color bar, at least 3/16" in width, for each ink color placed parallel to the ink rollers.  Color control bars (such as, BRUNNER, GATF or GRETAG) must contain star targets, trapping, tint and dot gain patches, process built grays, if applicable, and extend the full width of the press sheet.  Ink densities shall be constant across the full width of the sheet with no deviations to exceed plus or minus ½ of one percent.  Light and heavy inking is not allowed.  The contractor shall provide the correct viewing conditions for all press sheet inspections including 5000 degree light sources housed in a completely enclosed neutral gray booth and functional densitometers.  PREAWARD SURVEY:  In order to determine the responsibility of the prime contractor, the government reserves the right to conduct a preaward survey, or to require samples to QATAP evaluate, or other evidence of technical, managerial, financial and similar abilities to perform, prior to the award of a contract.  PACKING: Pack the completed project in new 44 pound edge crush test (or 275 bursting strength) corrugated containers filled to the top, with a corrugated column divider in between the stacks to prevent binding element entangles.  The cartons shall be specifically manufactured to fit this product.  The maximum weight shall not exceed 40 lbs. per carton.  Products must lay flat, do not stand upright in cartons.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis, under authority of FAR 13.501(a), with Bede Scientific Incorporated, 14 Inverness Drive East, Suite H-100, Englewood, CO 80112 for two (2) each Microsource Microfocus X-ray Generators with the following options and accessories: stand with X,Y and two tilt adjustments; recirculating heat exchanger; water chiller unit, and virtual microsource software for remote control or readout.  Dual silver-anode X-ray sources are required to upgrade the NIST high precision lattice parameter system.  The Bede Scientific is a high–brightness X-ray source based upon a magnetically-focussed electron tube and integral polycapillary optic.  In a small (10-25 micron) spot it has intensity comparable with that from a rotating anode generator fitted with any current optical system, together with low horizontal and vertical divergence (<0.05 degree).  It is also free from the side-lobes of intensity that are characteristic of electrostatically-focussed tubes and a proven stability of focal spot position at the submicron level over a period of hours.   Bede Scientific is the only source capable of providing an instrument with the combination of low power dissipation (10-25W), high-brilliance, low-divergence, source stability, and electromagnetic focusing.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, interested parties may identify their capability to satisfy the Government’s requirements no later than the response date above.  A determination not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  No solicitation package will be issued.

This statement must demonstrate that the proposed system is currently in place and operating on the Web.  The NCI will not consider statements that propose to develop a new system.  It must also list trials as specified.  The statement and any other supporting information must be furnished in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party meets the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on July 8, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The required response date/time has changed from 01-Jul-2003 12:00 AM to 07-Jul-2003 11:00 AM. The following have been added by full text:  AMENDMENT NUMBER 0001 TO SOLICITATION NUMBER DABK41-03-T-1516 FOR AIRLIFT SUPPORT SERVICES 1. This is amendment 0001 to Solicitation No. DABK41-03-T-1516 entitled is Airlift Support Services issued to answer questions in response to the solicitation as follows:  Q.1. There are several references to backup aircraft and 2 hour response time to YPG. Is this a guaranteed type contract, one that pays the contractor to have the aircraft available?  Or is this a call when needed contract?   A.1. The contractor should include in their proposal any guaranteed payments they need to provide the response time required. You are permitted to offer alternate response times with and without guarantee payments included in your proposal. Q.2. There are references to FAR Part 91/public use operation as well as operation IAW DoDD 4500.53. DoD 4500.53 requires FAR Part 135 and AMC inspected/approved. Will the Government waive the 4500.53 requirements and accept a part 91 operated aircraft? A.2. The contractor should include in their proposal any non-compliance with FAR Part 91, FAR Part 135, and DoD 4500.53.  YPG will consider waiving some non-compliance to DoD 4500.53, specifically the AMC inspection/approval since you are flying on a comme rcial basis. Q.3. Reference is made to aircraft refueling being conducted by YPG personnel at YPG. Does the Government intent to provide Fuel at no cost to the contractor?  A.3. The contractor can propose a wet (with contractor provided fuel) price and/or a dry (YPG provided fuel) price.  If the contractor provides the fuel as part of the offer (fuel included) price, it is the contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s choice whether the fuel is purc hased from YPG or the Contractor obtains fuel at any other location. We are unable to guarantee fuel prices at YPG as military fuel prices fluctuate the same as the commercial world. Q.3.A. If not, is the contractor required to refuel at YPG or at the contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s choice?  A.3.A. See answer A.3 above. Q.3.B. If the contractor is required to purchase fuel at YPG, will the Government guarantee a price?  A.3.B. It is not mandated that you purchase from YPG. See answer A.3 above Q.4. Reference is made to insurance requirements for Work Comp, General Liability and auto liability however no reference is made to aircraft passenger liability or third party liability (working off the reservation). What are the aircraft related insuranc e requirements?  A.4. Other than the standard commercial insurance requirements of FAR 52.228-5 (beginning on page 30) and stated minimum insurance requirements within the Addenda to FAR 52.228-5 (page 33), we impose no additional Federal Aviation Administration, Military or other civil insurance requirements.  Q.5. In the C-123 Evaluation Criteria, reference is made to installation of a full set of intermediate roller conveyors. Please provide the dimensions of the reference set of rollers. A.5. Yuma Proving Ground no longer has access to C-123 technical data, as it is no longer in the AF inventory. General information on the rollers is that there should be four rows of rollers that run from the forward bulkhead to the end of the cargo ramp. The rollers should be mechanically affixed to the aircraft floor (not simply tied down). Each roller is approx 2 inches in diameter and 4 inches long and assembled into long rows. Q.6. In a two places in the solicitation Department of Defense Directive 5400.53 is mentioned. Is this a typo? Was Department of Defense Directive 4500.53 intended instead? DoD Directive 4500.53 is Department of Defense Commercial Air Transportation Qualit y and Safety Review Program. A Contractor would require this directive to waived as no C-130 aircraft as specifically requested in the solicitation is capable of meeting this directive. Is there a web site where the directive can be reviewe d and thoroughly read for complete understanding of all implications, or can a copy be requested via e-mail? A.6. This was a typographical mistake and the correct citation is Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) is 4500.53 and the directive may be viewed on the Internet at the following web site http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/d450053_121200/d4500 53p.pdf address. It is the intent of YPG to ensure that the aircraft offered for use receive proper certification for the aircraft type. If your aircraft required such certification, then you must obtain such certification and provide it with your proposal . If the certification does not apply to the type of aircraft you are offering, then your aircraft would automatically be exempt from such aircraft certification and you may address this exemption in your proposal to the Government.  Q.7. The bottom of page 35 mentionsÃ¢Â€Â¦ Aircraft operator will hold appropriate Federal Aviation Administration certificationÃ¢Â€Â¦ to which proper FAA certification or CFR title 14 does this reference? A.7. The aircraft is to be operated and maintained in accordance with Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91. The pilots shall hold the appropriate FAA type rating for the aircraft they are providing.  An example might be commercial, multi-engine in strument rating. The pilot ratings should be provided in the proposals. Q.8. After award of the contract, are aircraft locked in and must be made available upon request at YPG no matter what other work the aircraft could presently be engaged in, or is there flexibility to allow the aircraft to complete other work it may be eng aged in, prior to reporting for duty at YPG? In other words, is the submitted aircraft and crew locked in for immediate call from July 2003 through September of 2006? A.8. As most of our testing is planned, it is YPGÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to always give as much advance notification for missions to any company supplying support aircraft under the resultant contract(s) from this solicitation. Providing your commercial schedule wi ll assist USAYPG is planning its schedule ahead of time. We recognize that you have business outside YPG and will coordinate fully with you to maintain schedules. There may be instances when military aircraft supporting missions may depart on an unschedule d basis. In such a case, YPG will give a minimum of a 72-hour notice, and if required, will provide you cancellation notification within 24 hours of execution of the test. 2. In order to consider the impact of these answers, the date and time set for receipt of proposals is extended and Contractors are to provide their proposal NO LATER THAN 11:00 AM, MST on 07 JULY 2003. 3.  All offerors must acknowledge that they have received and read Amendment 0001 within their written proposals to the government.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested at this time and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, DTSA20-03-Q-00942 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13.  This requirement is set-aside for small businesses.   The associated NAICS code is 3261 Plastics Product Manufacturing and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  Congress, through the Aviation and Transportation Security Act signed by the President November 19, 2001, requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to implement 100 percent screening of checked baggage.  To be successful, TSA must have the ability to open for inspection 100% of baggage.  Because airports have mixed baggage populations (screened and unscreened) it has been determined that there is a need for a TSA “Cleared Sticker”.  The Cleared Sticker will be used by the screeners and the baggage handlers to differentiate bags that have or have not been screened.  THE LINE ITEMS ARE AS FOLLOW:  0001 – TSA Cleared Stickers, QTY = 220,000,000 EACH.

Adhesive: Permanent for use on thermal coated baggage tags.  Static imprint: Security Holographic TSA logo (or other approved design) in center.  Imprint: Consecutive alphanumeric numbering (3-letter individual airport code plus 7 digits).  Packaging: Individual roll "dispenser" boxes which the contractor shall propose for review and approval by TSA Labels per Roll: The contractor shall propose for review and approval by TSA.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL OFFER THE GOVERNMENT ANY FAVORABLE QUANTITY PRICE BREAKS.

<DESC>The General Services Administration is concerned by the limited interest demonstrated for this procurement from certified HUBZone small businesses.  As described in solicitation amendment 0001, a third and final site visit has been scheduled for 10:00 AM local time on June 27, 2003 at the Foley U.S. Courthouse in Albany.  The agency will carefully consider the attendance of prospective HUBZone offerors as an indication of interest in this procurement.  The set-aside will be reevaluated should the contracting officer determine that the government is unlikely to receive bids from two or more HUBZone certified firms with average annual gross receipts not more than $12 million.  Prospective offerors also are urged to carefully consider the allowable level of subcontracting for this procurement.  No more than 75% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel may be spent on employees from other than HUBZone small business concerns.  Please immediately direct any additional questions to the points of contact listed below in order that this procurement may proceed in an orderly and efficient manner.  The General Services Administration appreciates the interest already expressed and is committed to providing ample additional opportunity before altering the set-aside.

BACKGROUND: The Fauna Module of the USDA Forest Service Natural Resource Information System (NRIS) for Terrestrial Wildlife Management is one of six NRIS components designed to implement a corporate approach to the management of natural resource information for the National Forest system. Additional information on the Fauna Module is available from www.fs.fed.us/emc/nris/fauna.  The Fauna module is comprised of a distributed database structure with ORACLE (tabular) and geographic information system (GIS) (spatial) components; Worldwide Web-based tools for accessing data from other sources and providing access to Fauna module data; and a set of applications designed for resource managers and specialists at district, forest, and regional levels.  Targeted users are wildlife biologists, ecologists, and other resource specialists involved in district and forest planning, inventory, monitoring, effects analysis, and implementation; species conservation and recovery strategies, and large scale ecosystem assessments.  Fauna operates agency-wide on the IBM Windows PC platforms with both tabular and graphical displays and manipulation of information.  

PURPOSE: The purpose of this acquisition is to gather, at the USDA Forest Service, Forest and District level, all non-electronic information on the species of concern.  During two meetings, the Forest and Planning Wildlife Biologists identified approximately 45 species of concern for inclusion in this contract and they are further identified in the RFQ.

<CONTACT>DARLA MILLS, (309)782-3316
<DESC>NA The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Research is to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing and supplying Insensitive-RDX (IRDX) to the United States Government, specifically the Department of the Army.  Please appropriately and precisely mark all specific proprietary information to be submitted in response to this market research relative to this item, as it will be safeguarded.  If you are a foreign country firm and have certain data that can only be released via a Country-to-Country Data  Exchange Agreement, please state specifically the precise data involved and what appropriate measures are required to facilitate release; please submit all other releasable data immediately.  In any response to be submitted in response to this notification, at a minimum, the following material information is desired: 1. Do you have production capability of both RDX (regular RDX) and IRDX (insensitive-RDX)?  If so, do you use separate production lines or the same production line?   2. Do you use a single process, Woolwich, Bachman or some other proprietary process, to produce these two materials?   3. Have you produced IRDX from material synthesized by the Bachman process or any other process that results in a substantial HMX impurity content?  If your answer is -yes-, does the product resulting from the synthesis steps need any special treatment?   4. What are your criteria for defining IRDX, as distinct from RDX?  What are the typical HMX contents in the RDX and IRDX?   5. How many classes (i.e. materials with different particle size distributions) of RDX and IRDX do you sell?   6. Provide the typical particle size distributions for representative batches for each class of RDX and IRDX.   7. How is each of these distributions achieved:  directly from crystallization?  Grinding of large particles?  Other?  Provide the basic material specification for your RDX and IRDX.

<DESC>17.	The Government intends to issue a solicitation for the design, development, documentation, and fabrication of two (2) handling carts for the cooling chamber used in the TRIDENT II (D5) weapon system.  An option for one (1) to four (4) additional carts may be requested.  The Cooling Chamber Handling Cart (CCHC) must be able to remove, install, and transport the cooling chamber on a rail system onboard the TRIDENT II (D5) submarine.  The cooling chamber is cylindrical and approximately 58 inches high, 30 inches outside diameter, and weighs approximately 4,000 pounds.  The cooling chamber contains bolt holes inside, near the top, that may be used for a specially designed handling fixture.  The space in which the CCHC must operate is extremely limited and the CCHC must be able to safely lower/lift and hold the cooling chamber into a tight tolerance space approximately 4 feet below deck.  The handling cart will be developed using performance specifications provided by the Government.  The Government intends to provide a cooling chamber to the contractor for design, development and test purposes.  This information may be updated periodically and expanded as additional information becomes available.  

The anticipated contract type is Cost Plus Incentive Fee awarded on a performance basis, but the Government retains the right to award another contract type if it is deemed more advantageous.  The Government intends to release the solicitation, including any subsequent amendments, via the Internet.  The solicitation release date is projected to be in late July 2003 and will be released through FedBizOps electronic posting (http://www.fedbizopps.gov).  The Government reserves the right to conduct a pre-award survey to include production facility site visits to verify manufacturing capability.

Prospective offerors are invited to submit expressions of interest and questions/comments to the POC Thomas L. Heilig, by e-mail to spn62@ssp.navy.mil or US Mail.  (E-mail is encouraged, as security measures have delayed regular US Mail deliveries in the Washington area).

<DESC>The  National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) of the U.S. Department of Education intends to acquire services on a sole source basis from: Hei Tech Services, National Rehabilitation Information Center, 4200 Forbes Blvd., Suite 202,
Lanham, Md. 20706-4829, 301-459-4263 (fax).  NARIC  will  work to identify  the  innovative tools  designed and  developed  by NIDRR projects.  The  tools  to be  analyzed  and  developed into a collection  have been reported by  109 grantees  in their yearly  Annual Performance Report. Tools  are checklists, survey instruments,  assessment  scales,  questionnaires, interview schedules designed  for specific  disabilities  and  applied to  collect information that can enhance the quality of life  and  integration of disabled  individuals in their communities.  The Contractor shall identify over the  period of three months, beginning  in the month of July  and  concluding  in the  month of September 2003,  the Tools  that will be included in the Collection. The Contractor will review and collect outcomes reported by NIDRR grantees in  their  APR's. These outcomes are in the form of  various  tools (such as surveys, questionnaires, interviews schedules, assessments, checklists etc.).  The Contractor will   examine  the  tools content, applying the  Evaluation  Criteria  established by NIDRR.  The contractor will assume responsibility for researching, examining  and describing  the purposes of the tools and  develop a site  where  customers could download them. This process will be done in collaboration  with NIDRR staff assigned to this project, appropriate  project personnel  and applying a  Evaluation Framework.  Hei Tech Services, Inc.  which operates  NARIC,  is  particularly suited to conduct this Collection effort.  NARIC has extensive experience in collecting NIDRR  grantees  information, and would bring  continuity to the proposed project  based on their prior work with NIDRR which would otherwise be lacking with the utilization of contractors unfamiliar with the overall agency mission and the specific tasks to be completed.  NARIC's  staff  have designed,  maintained and disseminated  information on federally- funded  projects for over 20 years.  NARIC's literature collection, which also includes commercially-published  books, journal articles, and audiovisuals, averages around 200 new documents per month.  They  have  the  information technology expertise required for this effort and, most importantly, extensive  experience serving people interested in disability and rehabilitation, including consumers, family members, health professionals, educators, rehabilitation counselors, students, librarians, administrators, and researchers. NARIC's own work will be enhanced by conducting this Collection effort as well. NARIC staff are familiar with NIDRR's  APR system and aware of the  GPRA  outcomes requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Contact Eva M. Gavillan at 202-205-8736 for more information.

<SUBJECT>A -- Partnership for the Radiation Oncology Molecular Assesment and Technology (ROMAT) Center for investigating the basic biology underlying molecular imaging, radiation therapy and systemic therapy
<DESC>Summary:  The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking Collaborators for Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) to work with investigators in the Radiation Oncology Sciences Program (ROSP) towards the development of a dynamic ROMAT Center that links imaging, radiation therapy and systemic therapy to underlying molecular processes. The overall goals are to understand the biological changes that produce the various images (MR, CT, PET, optical, others to be developed, etc.) along with existing and novel imaging and contrast agents, to inter-compare imaging modalities, and to assess the changes in image and molecular signature that occur during and after cancer treatment. The NCI is seeking long-term dynamic and highly interactive scientific collaborations with parties developing current and future technology for molecular imaging in clinical and preclinical settings.  The intention is to create an environment that will link a spectrum of clinicians, basic scientists, engineers, physicists, chemists, and extramural collaborators to facilitate the delivery of molecular imaging and therapy to patients.

Potential Areas of Application:
·	Various imaging modalities and techniques can be compared with one another and related to the underlying biological processes.
·	Novel imaging technologies and applications can be rapidly compared with existing technology, thereby expediting development.
·	The impact of intervention with radiation and/or systemic agents can be evaluated in the image and molecular biological changes.
·	Animal and human imaging can be intercompared.
·	Development of novel supporting technologies such as robotics and image processing, etc.

Main Advantages of Technology/Intervention:
The NCI offers the opportunity to partner in establishing the ROMAT Center which will provide the locus and environment for the conduct of clinical and preclinical studies designed to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment. ROMAT will use imaging and molecular analyses such as genomics and proteomics that ultimately may allow for the individualization of cancer prevention and treatment. The ROMAT program will advance the clinical application of new imaging and therapeutic strategies through comprehensive patient study in a clinical research environment.

To be successful, TSA must have the ability to open for inspection 100% of baggage.  Because airports have mixed baggage populations (screened and unscreened) it has been determined that there is a need for a TSA “Cleared Sticker”.  The Cleared Sticker will be used by the screeners and the baggage handlers to differentiate bags that have or have not been screened.  THE LINE ITEMS ARE AS FOLLOW:  0001 – TSA Cleared Stickers, QTY = 220,000,000 EACH.  CLIN DESCRIPTIONS- 0001 – TSA “Cleared Baggage” Stickers shall be produced in up to seven colors, which may include red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple and teal. The vendor shall modify this design when instructed by TSA based on experience and field-testing.  These designs may be changed as often as once every 30 days.  The Cleared Stickers shall be ¾ inches – 1 inch diameter round pressure-sensitive high-security labels.  Material: "Destruct", frangible material.  Adhesive: Permanent for use on thermal coated baggage tags.  Static imprint: Security Holographic TSA logo (or other approved design) in center.  Imprint: Consecutive alphanumeric numbering (3-letter individual airport code plus 7 digits).  Packaging: Individual roll "dispenser" boxes which the contractor shall propose for review and approval by TSA Labels per Roll: The contractor shall propose for review and approval by TSA.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL OFFER THE GOVERNMENT ANY FAVORABLE QUANTITY PRICE BREAKS.  THE CONTRACTOR MUST SUBMIT PRODUCT SAMPLES IN THE AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED (100) EACH OF THE ITEM IDENTIFIED IN CLIN 0001 ABOVE AT THE TIME OF RESPONSE TO THIS SOLICITATION.  Delivery shall be coordinated by TSA and made by F.O.B. Destination to approximately 429 airports nationwide at addresses to be furnished by the Government for a period of one (1) year after date of contract award.  The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial, applies to this solicitation and the specific evaluation criteria included in paragraph (a) of that provision is QUALITY OF PRODUCTS SAMPLES.  Offerors are advised to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items, with response to the RFQ.

To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the vessel's  INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.
