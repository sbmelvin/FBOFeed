<DESC>The Government intends to procure one commercially available Plasma Etcher System (Phantom III RIE Etch System) from Trion Technology, Inc., Clearwater, FL.  This requirement shall consist of the following components: The capability to etch wafer type substrates using state of the art inductively coupled plasma (ICP) techniques. This system shall have the capability to etch silicon and other inorganic and organic substances commonly used in a micro-fabrication laboratory where typically, but not exclusively, microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices are fabricated from silicon and related materials. Automatic gas pressure control for the regulation of gasses supplied to the etching chamber. The platen for the system shall accommodate 200 mm diameter substrates. A heater/chiller capability for substrate temperature control. The substrate holding mechanism shall be of a mechanical clamping type. The top platen power shall be at least 1200 Watts input power. The system shall have a recirculation type cooling system to maintain operating temperatures of critical components of the system. The system shall have a load lock for faster pump down time after a change of substrate. The system shall have a laser based endpoint detection for the measurement of the etch depth of the substrate. The system shall be capable of automatic tuning of the RF coupling network to achieve maximum power input with minimum reflected power. The system shall use turbo vacuum pumps to achieve higher vacuum with scroll dry roughing pumps. There shall be a minimum of six gas mass flow controllers installed on the system for gas inputs. The system shall be controlled from a control computer with a MS-Windows with a touch screen graphical user interface.  Control of all system operating functions shall be convenient to use.  Installation of the system at the users facility and bring the system up and demonstrate all operational and specification performance levels. Operator and maintenance manuals for the system. The system shall be constructed of new materials. No used, reconditioned or refurbished parts shall be used. One (1) year warranty for parts and labor for maintenance for the system. This Plasma Etcher System will be used in the fabrication of micro/nano-electrochemical systems (MEMS/NEMS) sensor devices and for microcircuit die material validation, verification, and failure analysis in support of Weapons Sciences Directorate (WSD), AMRDEC.  Trion Technology, Inc. has over 25 years experience in the fabrication of etching systems for micro-fabrication laboratories and is the only known source for this requirement. This laboratory instrument is desired to be directly compatible with program partner existing capability (instrument) and it is desired for WSD to duplicate their laboratory instrument to facilitate the portability of fabrication processes already researched. Any other instrument would incur increased program costs to the Government. Plasma etchers acquired from another vendor (brand) would have differences in etch chemistries and hardware that would produce varying results when compared to existing processes.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be fully considered by the agency under a low price technically acceptable source selection process meeting or exceeding the minimum system requirements.  Point of contact is Sarah Hackney, Contract Specialist, telephone 256-842-7260, e-mail sarah.hackney@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Veteran Affairs, Veteran Integrated Service Network Twenty-two (VISN 22) is soliciting for Medical Supplies and delivery to VA Patients. The BPAs resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to the responsible, responsive offerors whose offer conforming to the solicitation is determined most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  Therefore, the offeror with the lowest cost or price alone may not necessarily be awarded the Open-Market BPA.

Contractor care shall cover the range of services normally provided in a similar civilian health care facility. Services provided shall be in accordance with the specifications and requirements contained herein. The BPA duration will be for three (3) years. The government may award multiple awards on a competitive basis to provide Shipment Services of ordered Medical Supplies directly to Veteran patient's home. This Request for Quotation as well as any subsequent award is subject to the applicable terms and conditions set forth under Federal Acquisition Regulations part 13. Pricing for services will not exceed the ceiling prices negotiated in the Pricing list submitted.  

MULTIPLE AWARDS: Since experience has demonstrated that one contractor cannot provide a guarantee to meet our needs, it is our intention to make multiple awards with a possible restriction on the number of awards made. As a consequence, it is reasonable to assume that we may not require the daily shipment services of all contractors awarded a BPA. In some instances, it is possible that a contractor's shipment services may not be utilized at all. With all things being equal, the VA will order medical supplies, on an as needed basis. The Government shall make a reasonable effort to rotate contractors. Performance and availability will be critical factors in obtaining orders.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in the Philippines, intends to issue a solicitation for proposal for an assessment of the Philippine education sector. The assessment will inform USAID/Philippines' approach in the education sector, and is being done through the Bilateral Assistance Agreement for Education Programs between the United States and the Philippines. USAID/Philippines anticipates awarding a fixed price contract to be completed over a period of three (3) months, estimated to begin on or about December 1, 2010. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The assessment shall cover all sub-sectors of education, both formal and informal: basic education (early childhood; primary education; secondary education; alternative learning systems for out-of-school children and youth; literacy training for adults; education for those with special needs; madrassah education); higher education; technical-vocational education and training; professional development; education governance; and education finance.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The DoD and the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) have a requirement for a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pharmacotherapeutic(s) for the treatment of Combat Related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  PTSD may result from exposure to a variety of stressors/events.  However, this solicitation specifically addresses PTSD associated with combat related to service in support of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF).  The objective is a safe and efficacious FDA approved product(s) with minimal side effects that can be used to treat PTSD in two populations of service members and veterans with PTSD diagnosed using the criteria in the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).  The first population is service members and veterans with combat related PTSD of less than one year duration, while the second population is service members and veterans with PTSD of greater than or equal to one year duration.  For the purpose of this RFP, these two populations include any service member with a diagnosis of PTSD incurred while on active duty status and deployed in support of OEF/OIF.  OEF/OIF veterans diagnosed with PTSD who are not presently on active duty (e.g., retired, discharged, reserve status, etc.) are included in the populations identified above.  PTSD is a serious issue in combat troops and veterans, and a new pharmacotherapeutic agent(s) to address PTSD is urgently needed.  Therefore, the starting TRL is extremely important.  Preference will be given to promising mature products such as those already FDA approved for another indication in order to reduce the developmental time line.  Selected efforts will specifically address development of a pharmacotherapeutic(s) from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 6 through completion of all requirements in TRL 8, as described in Attachment 1:  Pharmacotherapeutic Technical Readiness Level (TRL) Achievement Form, or online in Appendix E of the Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) Deskbook at: http://www.dod.mil/ddre/doc/DoD_TRA_July_2009_Read_Version.pdf.<BR>DELIVERABLES should be identified by the Offeror in the proposal and at minimum should include:	1)Letters to the Government giving full rights of access to the data and information in Contractors IND and any applicable drug master file prepared using the data collected during the contract period; 2) Project Management Plan that defines project scope, activities and schedule and which includes: (a)Integrated Master Schedule; (b)Risk Management Plan; (c)FDA Regulatory Plan; 3) Quality Assurance Plan; 4) Participate in Monthly Teleconferences; 5) Quarterly Reports; 6) Annual Report; 7) Clinical Study and Statistical Analysis Plans; 8) Collection and Analysis Data Base; 9) Copies of all Documents submitted to the FDA to include the IND, NDA/sNDA, all correspondence between the FDA and Offeror related to the funded development of the pharmacotherapeutic; and 10)Annual Meeting.  The Government reserves the right to award one or multiple contracts as a result of this solicitation. Any resulting contract(s)will be issued based on best value to the U. S. Army.  It is anticipated that a cost contract(s)will be awarded.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>TITLE: Network-Centric Sensors and Data Sources (N-CSDS) Support
<p>SOLICITATION #: FA8819-11-R-0002, Special Notice Research and Development - Sources Sought and Request for Statements of Capability</p>
<p>DUE: 01 Nov 2010</p>
<p>POC: Capt Louis Aldini (louis.aldini@losangeles.af.mil) and Mr. Tom Clay (thomas.clay.ctr@losangeles.af.mil), Technical Advisor</p>
<p>DOCUMENT TYPE: Special Notice R&amp;D</p>
<p>NAICS CODE: 541712 (Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences) with a size standard of 1,000 employees</p>
<p>OVERVIEW:</p>
<p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) is soliciting sources, industry qualifications and concepts in anticipation of releasing a draft Request for Proposal for the Net-Centric Sensors and Data Sources (N-CSDS) program to perform development, integration and contractor logistics support of existing and future N-CSDS capabilities.</p>
<p>The purpose of N-CSDS is to net-centrically expose data from legacy space surveillance network (SSN) sensors, non-traditional SSN sensors (e.g. Missile Defense Agency), and other data sources. Net-centrically available SSA data will lay the foundation to enable: 1) machine-to-machine exchange of information, 2) the ability of the warfighter to process, fuse, and display space situational awareness (SSA) information in near real time, and 3) the warfigher to develop CONOPS to use existing information in new, innovative ways. While not captured in a formal requirements document, data exposed by N-CSDS is expected to address the needs of JSPOC Mission System (JMS) capability deliveries (e.g.. mission services), address data needs as identified by evolving SSA mission threads and be in concert with other net-centric initiatives.</p>
<p>N-CSDS is intended to provide follow-on operational capabilities for net-centric data exposure as demonstrated earlier by the Extended Space Sensor Architecture (ESSA) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) conducted by MIT/Lincoln Laboratories. This effort developed and deployed "sidecars" at several USAF space surveillance and Missile Defense Agency sites to expose space surveillance data to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). This effort proved the concept of exposing data to the Global Information Grid (GIG) allowing users to pull available critical information to support their missions.</p>
<p>The "sidecars" are based on a common, modular architecture to ensure compatibility with SIPRNET with tailoring to allow integration with specific sensors.</p>
<p>SMC/SYSW is interested in industry capabilities to transition technologies and capabilities from MIT/LL to a qualified industry provider to:</p>
<p>1) Ensure ESSA ACTD systems continue to be logistically supported to allow continued support to users for sensor data exposure.<br />2) Leverage ESSA ACTD common architecture and develop new N-CSDS capabilities to support emerging user space situational awareness data exposure needs.<br />3) Retrofit, deploy and integrate N-CSDS systems at Air Force and other operational sensor sites minimizing disruption to ongoing operations.</p>
<p><br />The government will assess contractor's capabilities as an input to developing the draft Request for Proposal. In addition, the government is considering hosting an N-CSDS Industry Day in late November/early December 2010. Announcements will be posted on FedBizOps.</p>
<p>RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>Statement of Capabilities (SOC) - Contractors responding to this Special Notice/Sources Sought Synopsis are encouraged to submit unclassified SOCs addressing their capabilities to address SMC/SYSW needs as detailed in the overview above. As part of the discussion, the following topics should also be addressed by industry providers:</p>

<p>Contractor's shall also submit Powerpoint presentations which provide a company overview that include organization, customers, products, business base, etc. Page count is at contractor's discretion. The PowerPoint Presentation may also include narrative in the notes section of each slide.</p>
<p>This notice will not result in the issuance of a contract to any of the responders. This is for informational purposes only. The Government wants to provide information on a potential contract action in the future and gain information on existing industry capabilities.</p>
<p>OMBUDSMAN: The SMC Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill. You can reach him at james.gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns with potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as the source of the concern when requested by the offeror.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) Synopsis:<BR><BR>INTRODUCTION: This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) notice for planning purposes. This RFI notice is being issued for the purpose of assessing industries current capabilities in providing energy efficient structures for use by military services in various theaters of operations.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  Any information provided does not constitute a proposal, but will be considered an exchange of capabilities and ideas. Neither Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS) nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the PM FSS will take procurement action in this matter.  <BR><BR>BACKGROUND: The remote locations of base camps create significant challenges for logistics support of combat operations.  These base camps are heavily dependent on large, long-distance truck convoys whose cargo is dominated by water and bulk fuel.  Convoy routes through unsecured areas are frequently hazardous, and transport is always expensive.  PM FSS is in the process of initiating dramatic steps toward rapidly improving the logistics support required to establish and operate base camps.  Information received from this RFI may be used to help identify technical solutions suitable for rapidly enhancing energy-related base camp operations.  Information received may ultimately result in requests for equipment manufacturers to demonstrate their technologies at no cost or risk to the Government as early as November 2010.<BR><BR>PURPOSE: PM FSS is interested in understanding the currently available technologies that could enhance the logistics sustainability of remote operating bases engaged in combat operations.  This RFI focuses on technologies and equipment that addresses energy efficient structures and/or shelters to replace existing systems.  Technologies of interest are those that would most effectively reduce the energy demand of a base camp supporting 150 personnel and a base camp supporting 600 personnel.  Information is requested in the form of brief product descriptions.  The current concepts of use for these Energy Efficient Structures (EES) will be for extended periods of time are to replace soft wall structures in operational theaters when deployments. Primary functional uses of these structures will be as billeting and/or office configurations as well as potentially providing additional capabilities to a field commander providing energy efficient structures.   <BR><BR>PLAN: The PM FSS is seeking Companies to demonstrate Energy Efficient Structures (EES) at Ft. Devens, MA starting on or after 29 November 2010 for a minimum of 90 days through September 2011.  Due to limited field space available to have companies demonstrate their products, PM FSS reserves the right to select only a small number of potential solutions being offered from the responses received. An initial selection criteria process for down selecting the candidates to be evaluated at Ft Devens is included. PM FSS plans on investigating each selected structure for energy and operational efficiency.  Each company selected will receive an independent PM FSS assessment of their commercial product only.  All costs associated with shipping, installation, take-down, re-installation, and removal of a companys Energy Efficient Structure (EES), or component thereof, from site shall be borne by the company.  PM FSS will supply material handling equipment (MHE) to off load assets from transportation means to ground on site.  PM FSS will assign a date and location for the assessment which will be coordinated with the company.<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS SOUGHT<BR><BR>Alternative rigid wall shelter system solutions with improved energy efficiency are sought to replace the current unit organic and service provided shelter systems.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ANNOUNCEMENT
Defense Logistics Agency
Defense Supply Center Richmond


PROGRAM OVERVIEW

The Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) is seeking information in an attempt to restructure support of our roller bearing/bushing acquisition and logistics mission through increasing Long Term Contracting Support.  Presently, DSCR uses a multitude of sources, storage facilities, and delivery methods to satisfy its customers worldwide demand for roller bearing and bushing products.  DSCRs intention is to leverage the commercial industrys best practices and implement a solution which assures readiness, safety, and efficiency.  Ultimately, DSCRs goal is to effectively reduce lead-times, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction.

Scope of Project

This initiative contains DSCR managed NSNs in Federal Stock Groups (FSGs) 3110/3120.  

	FSG 3110-Roller Bearings (Unmounted)
	FSG 3120-Bushings
	FSG 3130-Roller Bearings (Mounted)

Anticipated Scope:

-Delivery of items to DLA depots or directly to DLAs customers in accordance with delivery terms.

-Collaboration with DLA on projected and anticipated demands

-Procurement/Purchasing-All actions related to acquisition planning, solicitation, evaluation, negotiations, contract award, contract administration, and contract management functions.  Responsible for all subcontracts.

-Data management-to include interoperability with industry and government systems.

RFI Questions

1) Universe of items (13,987 NSNs within the three identified FSGs)

A.   How would you recommend the universe of items within these three FSGs be set up (i.e. when looking at these 3 FSGs, do you envision multiple contracts per FSG)?  Should the FSGs be combined into one contract or should we solicit and award separate contract for each of the FSGs or some suggested combination of them?

2) Collaboration

A.  How would you recommend collaborating on anticipated demand to reduce ALT/PLT/Lead time in response to changes in demand?  

B. What is the optimum length of contract to reduce costs and improve availability?

C. What is the maximum firm fixed price period length?  Beyond the firm fixed price period what is best method of adjusting pricing, price redetermination or EPA?  At what frequencies?
 
D. What method would you utilize to manage low value, nonrecurring demand items?

E.  Can you support both DLA direct (DLA stocked) support and Customer Direct (DLA direct customer) requirements?

3)Packaging/Marking Requirements

A) Do you repackage items as a part of your supplier function?

B.   Are you familiar with and can you comply with military packaging requirement for both roller bearings and bushings?  (Some roller bearings require clean room packaging-Mil Detail 197)

C.  Are you familiar with and can you comply with military product marking requirements?

4) Data Management

A.  What type of data systems do you currently utilize and do you see any concerns with integrating your IT systems with other industry partners and Government agencies?  

B.  Can you process electronic transmissions?

5)  Sources of Supply

A.   What type of Roller Bearing/Bushing products do you regularly supply?  Are all FSGs identified aligned with your product mix?  If not, is the list broader or narrower than the items you support?

B.  Please identify whether your company is a manufacturer, non-manufacturer, or other?

C.  What percentage of your product line is manufactured by your company?

D.  DLA is required to purchase roller bearings as a domestic product.  If just one component of a bearing assembly is manufactured outside the U.S. or Canada, the entire assembly is considered to be a foreign bearing.  What method would you use to actively identify and notify DLA of items that change from domestic to foreign and back?

E.  What method would you utilize to reduce the number of foreign bearings and to increase the purchase of domestic bearings? 

F.  How do you recommend managing Critical Safety Items/First Article Testing items/Product Verification Testing items/Production Lot Testing items in a Long Term Agreement?

6) Small Business Classification

A.  Indicate if your company is a small business.  The NAICS codes and business sizes for this initiative are:

<DESC><strong>Notice Number: </strong> HHS-NIH-NCI-SBSS-TSB-17003-64
<p><strong>Title:</strong> - Clinical Studies Monitoring Service (CSMS) for National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is <strong>NOT </strong>a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. <strong>An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</strong></p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this Notice and the draft Statement of Work to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>Since its creation as an independent Center in 1998, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) has developed a broad research portfolio focused on a variety of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices. CAM practices are a group of diverse medical and health care systems, interventions, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.  In view of its expanding portfolio of clinical research, this project provides for the support of the NCCAM Clinical Studies Monitoring Services (CSMS) Contract to enhance clinical studies oversight by the NCCAM Office of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs (OCRA).</p>
<p>The NCCAM currently funds a broad portfolio of clinical studies that investigate CAM practices with biologically-based or mind/body-based interventions <br />http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/spotlight/atoz.htm. The biologically-based interventions include those such as dietary supplements (i.e., omega-3 fatty acids, creatine), probiotics, and botanical products (i.e., silymarin, saw palmetto extract).  As many of the biologically-based studies funded by NCCAM focus on a specific disease or condition of use, many such studies are conducted under an IND issued by the FDA.  By contrast, the mind/body-based intervention studies include modalities such as yoga, Tai Chi, meditation, acupuncture, massage therapy and chiropractic manipulation. The majority of NCCAM-sponsored clinical research is conducted in single-site studies, and is conducted at academic medical centers, hospitals, clinics and physician offices through a variety of funding mechanisms such as cooperative agreements, grants, and contracts. In addition, several studies are conducted outside of the US, in Canada, Hong Kong, Peru and South Africa. NCCAM also supports an intramural clinical research program at the NIH Clinical Center. The NCCAM clinical research portfolio therefore incorporates many scientific disciplines and includes studies of diverse design, clinical setting, size and complexity.</p>
<p>In view of the diverse scope of NCCAM-funded clinical studies, the NCCAM/OCRA plays a primary role in clinical studies oversight for the approximately 150 ongoing clinical projects.  Monitoring of clinical sites is one element of a larger program of clinical studies oversight developed by OCRA to fulfill its responsibilities of ensuring the safety and welfare of participants, of maximizing adherence to appropriate clinical research regulations and guidelines and maximizing data quality from NCCAM-funded studies.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is to identify qualified small business concerns including HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. On behalf of NCCAM, the NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>As a result of this SBSS Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). <strong>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</strong> However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to provide comprehensive clinical site and study monitoring services for the NCCAM extramural clinical studies research portfolio and other support efforts as outlined in the draft SOW.

<DESC>1. This is a special notice open to U.S. industry requesting information on technologies available in the next one year to provide new or enhanced current electronic warfare distributed test and training capabilities for Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) weaponry. The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) is interested in reviewing the state-of-the-art and emerging technologies applicable to distributed physics Based AEA object models.

2. The objective of this request is to identify consistent, physics based approaches on how to adjudicate Radio Frequency Jammers and Emitters across the Joint Forces Command Information Operations Range (IOR) to support the Joint Live, Virtual and Constructive (JLVC) Modeling and Simulation Federation.

3.
 Background: The parametric data and algorithms essential to accurately replicate jamming effects in a simulated, distributed environment are at a very rudimentary level, if defined at all.  Especially for newer systems, the parameters of the jamming systems and their effects on targets are not very well known. Furthermore, the algorithms which do exist are largely physics constructs and do a poor job of replicating the real world with all the environmental factors.

3.1 Manual operator intervention is required for consistent representation of jamming effects across the federates.  If a desired jamming effect is clearly defined by the Navys Jammer Techniques Optimization (JATO) group, then there is likely a manual method which could be devised to generate the desired effect.
  The success in our ability to manually depict jamming effects is highly dependent on the ability of the model to replicate the desired jammer characteristics, replicate the effects on the targeted system(s), as well as how long and how wide spread the effects are.  Since execution depends on manual control to achieve a desired jamming effect, the success of replicating the effect diminishes the more complex, wide scale and long term the jamming event is.
  
4. Submittals must address:
4.1 The necessary processing requirements, network requirements and open architecture characteristics of the identified approach. It should demonstrate the feasibility of the approach through simple modeling examples that validate the ability to conduct AEA testing and training events on the IOR such that jammer and emitter algorithms will not be susceptible to inherent latencies of the IOR network.

4.2 How high fidelity jammer models can be integrated with Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) and Joint Integrated Mission Model (JIMM) to replicate the effects of EA-6B and EA-18G ALQ-99 and Digital Radio Frequency Modulation (DRFM) jamming on Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) and communication devices, as applicable.
 

4.3 In what way high fidelity emitter models can be integrated with TENA and JIMM to replicate the effects of IADS on Tactical Jammer Receiver Systems (TJRS) such as the ALQ-218 and DRFM Receiver Systems. 

4.4 To what extent a complete set of jammer and emitter models can be use on the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS) and Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF) that are sponsored by U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM). 

4.5 Methodologies, from which models can be verified, validated and accredited to support Operational Testing by COMOPTEVFOR.

5. This notice is not to be construed as any type of request for proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
 Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.

6. Submissions will be considered up to and including SECRET. Companies are to adhere to the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) procedures for the transmittal of classified responses. Company responses are to include a name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with government representatives. Companies are not limited to a single response. Submissions are due within 60 days from release of this announcement by 12:00 PM PDT and may be made by mailing your response on a compact disk and one original and 3 hard copies to:

NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. <BR><BR>Project Description: A construction solicitation for the $15.5M FY10 Congressional Add MCA PN059978/329828, Analytical Chemistry Wing  (11,500 SF) and Administrative Area Addition (14,500 SF) to the Advanced Chemical Laboratory, Edgewood Area, Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD.  Construct a state-of-the-art advanced analytical chemistry wing for work with supertoxic chemical agents and toxins with associated data reduction space and administrative space. Construction will be phased to keep the existing labs, which contain supertoxic chemical agents, operational.  The contractor will be required to work around these labs during construction. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is provided from a central plant. Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; paving, walks, curbs, and gutters; storm drainage; information systems; and site improvements. APG needs to construct an Advanced Chemistry Lab to meet its current mission. Current facilities are inadequate and now require impermeable surfaces, special chemical hoods with ultra-efficient carbon filtration, and extensive electrical backup systems. Safety and environmental controls are paramount to ensure that personnel and the environment are protected against these supertoxic and lethal materials.  Design analysis prepared for this project indicates that significant experience with highly toxic and surety laboratory construction is necessary to support the successful completion of construction of this project within the established constraints.  Additionally, the project includes significant renovation of existing laboratory and administrative spaces while maintaining daily function and mission requirements within the facility.   <BR><BR>Only interested SMALL BUSINESS PRIME CONTRACTORS should submit a narrative demonstrating their experience in type of work at the similar contract value in a similar type of location, including LEED Silver certification or better.

These Oxygen & Carbon Dioxide values are part of the constant and recorded computerized data acquisition system for these chambers and require 4-20ma outputs. <BR>Most gas analyzer manufacturers outputs are 0-5V and their analyzer s cannot easily measure gases from a negative pressure atmospheres to standard pressure.  The devices must not require constant calibration and have a reasonable resolution around normal values.  Since most hyperbaric and hypobaric chamber have service company in the area.  We have used one such company for hypobaric instrumentation work in the past and this vendor was recommended.  Amron Intl. supplies the majority of the O2 and CO2 devices for hyperbaric and hypobaric chambers.  <BR>2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs: CO2 analyzer 0-1%, oxygen analyzer 0-100%, (4 to 20 ma output range)   <BR>	<BR><BR>2)	A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):  These devices are supported by the company in the future, and have the proper outputs for our data acquisition system (4-20ma) and are used by the installation engineering company in all of the hyperbaric and hypobaric chambers they service in the continental US.

Contacted one in Cumberland R.I. and Lexington, MA they both did not feel comfortable in selling us analyzer for that type of application. The original vendor Teledyne Inst. does not have a CO2 analyzer but does have an O2 analyzer for possible usage in this application. I do not want two different companies providing measurements and possible different technologies for this critical human safety application.<BR><BR>5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: <BR>None<BR><BR>6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  None<BR><BR><BR> <BR><BR>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: greg.n.wilson@us.army.mil no later than 8:00 a.m. on  October 12, 2010.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Greg Wilson, Contract Specialist<BR>Greg.N.Wilson@us.army.mil<BR>

The NPS may issue Temporary Concessions Contracts or assign Sub-concessioners for some or all of the facilities.

<p><br />SECTION M: EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD <br />SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as factors, subfactors to be eligible for award. Any aspect of the proposal judged to be unacceptable would render the entire proposal unacceptable. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in the offeror being removed from consideration for award. Any exceptions to the solicitation's terms and conditions must be fully explained and justified.</p>
<p>a. Basis for contract Award<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation. The Government intends to award without discussions and reserves the right to award without discussions; therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded<br />The Government intends to select one contractor. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>d. Correction Potential of Proposals<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency or proposal inadequacy. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.<br />EVALUATION FACTORS<br />(IAW FAR 13.306-2(b), 14.201-5(c))<br />a. List factors and Subfactors:<br />Government based upon an evaluation for acceptability of evaluation factors and subfactors described below:</p>
<p>1.1 FACTOR 1: Technical <br />FACTOR 2: Price<br />FACTOR 3: Past Performance</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology<br />Price will be evaluated first and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price. After price is evaluated the technical acceptability evaluation will begin, starting with the lowest evaluated price offeror. After the technical acceptability evaluation, past performance will be evaluated. The first proposal evaluated as technically acceptable, responsible, and an acceptable past performance rating will be considered the best value proposal and all other technical evaluations will cease. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions will be considered for award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. Cost/Price Factor<br />(IAW 5315.305(a)(1)) <br />Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated by multiplying unit prices with the BEQ's including those for the option yeas as well. Transportation costs will also be used in the evaluation.<br />(1) Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>(2) Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the applications of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items or subline items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>d. Technical Factor<br />Each subfactor within the Technical Factor will receive one of the ratings described below. Subfactor ratings shall not be rolled up into an overall rating factor. An unacceptable subfactor assessment will determine an overall unacceptable technical rating.</p>
<p>Acceptable- The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable- The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance. Proposal with unacceptable rating is not awardable.</p>
<p>e. Past Performance Factor<br />A responsibility determination IAW FAR 9.1 shall constitute an acceptable past performance rating for this award.</p>
<p>f. Discussions<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions; therefore, it is imperative that offeror's submit their best terms initially. However, if during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices, and the Final Proposal Revisions will be considered in making the source selection decision.</p>
<p><br />NOTE 23: Award will be made only if the eofferor, the product/service or the manufacturer meets qualification requirement award in accordance with FAR Clause 52.209-1 and 52.206-2. The solicitation identifies the officered additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements and is cited in each individual solicitation.</p>

<a href="mailto:Joseph.Mendoza2@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>BASIS FOR AWARD: The BPAs resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to the responsible, responsive offerors whose offer conforming to the solicitation is determined most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  Therefore, the offeror with the lowest cost or price alone may not necessarily be awarded the BPA.

SCOPE OF WORK: The Department of Veterans Affairs is soliciting a service requirement to establish an Open Market Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to ship to our eligible Veterans Shipment Services of ordered Medical Supplies directly to Veteran patient's home. The ordered Medical supplies shall be shipped to the patient's home via common carrier. 

Contractor care shall cover the range of services normally provided in a similar civilian health care facility. Services provided shall be in accordance with the specifications and requirements contained herein. The BPA duration will be for three (3) years. The government may award multiple awards on a competitive basis to provide Shipment Services of ordered Medical Supplies directly to Veteran patient's home. This Request for Quotation as well as any subsequent award is subject to the applicable terms and conditions set forth under Federal Acquisition Regulations part 13. Pricing for services will not exceed the ceiling prices negotiated in the Pricing list submitted.  

MULTIPLE AWARDS: Since experience has demonstrated that one contractor cannot provide a guarantee to meet our needs, it is our intention to make multiple awards with a possible restriction on the number of awards made. As a consequence, it is reasonable to assume that we may not require the daily shipment services of all contractors awarded a BPA. In some instances, it is possible that a contractor's shipment services may not be utilized at all. With all things being equal, the VA will order medical supplies, on an as needed basis. The Government shall make a reasonable effort to rotate contractors. Performance and availability will be critical factors in obtaining orders.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Central Texas Veterans Health Care System, Temple VA Medical Center hereby amends Request for Quote VA-257-10-RQ-0366 for Reverse Osmosis Water De-Ionization Systems and De-Ionized Water Systems.


On Monday, October 25, 2010 there will be a site visit at the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System, Temple VA Medical Center located at 1901 Veterans Memorial Drive, Temple, TX 76504.  The intention of the site visit is to allow all interested parties in the above mentioned Request for Quote to observe the clinical, laboratory and research areas described in the Statement of Work that require Reverse Osmosis Water De-ionization Systems and De-Ionized Water Systems.  Although the requirement calls for service at the Waco VA Medical Center and the Austin Outpatient clinic - those areas are a very small portion of the overall work expected from the contractor on this contract so this site visit will not include those areas designated at the Waco VA Medical Center or the Austin Outpatient Clinic.  

All parties will RSVP no later than Monday, October 18, 2010 at 4:30 PM.  RSVP will be taken by the Contracting Specialist, Jennifer L. Salerno-Diciuccio via e-mail at Jennifer.Salerno-Diciuccio@va.gov.  Specific directions to the meeting place will be given upon request at the time of the RSVP.


We request that interested vendors limit the members of their party to no more than three individuals due to the fact that many of the areas that will be visited are working clinical, research and laboratory areas which must not be disrupted resulting in any delay in care to our Veteran population, staff or volunteers.

Please note that the Department of Veterans Affairs, Central Texas Veterans Health Care System, Temple VA Medical Center will not reimburse interested vendors in any way for travel costs to attend this site visit.  All costs associated with attending the site visit will be completely at the interested vendors' expense.

The site visit will begin promptly at 9:00 AM Central Standard Time.

The site visit will begin from outside the main entrance of Building 171 on the Temple VA Medical Center Campus.  Parking is available for free but is limited.

This will be a walking tour of more than one building at the Temple VA Medical Center Campus.  Please be prepared for at least one hour of walking throughout the campus and its buildings.

All vendors must bring proper identification so that they can be recorded on a sign in sheet at the time of the visit.

Although it is expected that there will be questions and answers as the tour commences vendors are encouraged to submit their questions formally via e-mail to the contracting specialist prior to the site visit so that they may be addressed formally on Fed Biz Ops to all interested parties to give fair opportunity.  If questions arise as a result of the site visit those will also be taken via e-mail, posted and answered on Fed Biz Ops to give fair opportunity to all interested parties.

This site visit is encouraged but is in no way a mandatory requirement in order to respond to the RFQ by the due date of October 29, 2010.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post amendment FA8505-10-R-21787-0002 and provide additional responses to questions asked by potential offerors.
<p>Q (15) On page 30 of the solicitation the following Clause was included: "I-283<br />52.222-41 SERVICE CONTRACT ACT OF 1965 (NOV 2007) (IAW FAR 22.1006(a))<br />(Applicable to services over $2,500)" Will this clause be deleted or will<br />the Government be issuing a DOL WD against the Solicitation?</p>
<p>A (15) Clause 52.222-41 will not be deleted. The Wage Determination will be posted with Amendment 0002.</p>
<p>Q (16) Section I-283 references FAR clause 52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965. Will the Government provide the applicable SCA Wage Determination for the solicitation?</p>
<p>A (16) The Wage Determination has been posted with Amendment 0002.</p>
<p>Q (17) The Answers to Questions posted to FBO on September 16 included the following:<br />Q (6): Will you use the Service Contract Act for any labor categories? If so, how many?<br />A (6): Yes, SCA applies to service contracts over $2,500 and flows down to subcontractors. The labor categories will be listed under the RFP.<br />As no Wage Determination was issued with the solicitation, please clarify if SCA rates do, indeed, apply, and if so will the Government be issuing a current Wage Determination?</p>
<p>A (17) The Wage Determination will be posted with Amendment 0002. The SCA will apply in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 22 &amp; supplements.</p>
<p>Q (18) On page 30 in paragraph B, it states: "Volume III is due in WR-ALC/830<br />ACSG/235 Byron Street Suite 19A Robins AFB, GA 31098-1607, Attention:<br />Alexander Comportie, seven (7) calendar days prior to the required due date<br />for proposals". This date calculates to be Columbus Day Oct. 11. Would the<br />Government consider moving this date to Oct. 12?</p>
<p>A (18) Please see amendment 0001, receipt of Offers has been extended. The extension did not change any other terms and conditions of the Request for Proposal. Reference the last sentence in paragraph B. It states: "However, failure to submit VOLUME III by the earlier date will not result in offeror disqualification."</p>
<p>Q (19) This question is regarding paragraph B. Volume I, of L-900. INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS, for Solicitation Number FA8505-10-R-21787. The paragraph states:</p>
<p>"(Volume III is due in WR-ALC/830 ACSG/235 Byron Street Suite 19A Robins AFB, GA 31098-1607, Attention: Alexander Comportie, seven (7) calendar days prior to the required due date for proposals." Later in the paragraph it states, "However, failure to submit VOLUME III by the earlier date will not result in offeror disqualification."</p>
<p>We request for ease of mailing and accountability for both the government and offerors, that you clarify the due date for all volumes of the proposal as 18-OCT-2010 3:30PM, per Block 9 of the 1447?</p>
<p>A (19) Please see amendment 0001, receipt of Offers has been extended.</p>
<p>Q (20) I saw Amendment 0001 to Solicitation Number: FA8505-10-R-21787 that you posted yesterday changing the due date to 29 October. Would you please confirm that the due date for Volume III - Present and Past Performance Information remains seven days before the due date of Volumes I, II, &amp; IV? Or are all four volumes now due on the same date?</p>
<p>A (20) The extension to receipt of Offers to 29 October 2010 did not change any other terms and conditions of the Request for Proposal.</p>
<p>Q (21) On page 49 of the Solicitation paragraph D Volume III - Present and Past<br />Performance it states that "The offeror may expand the answering space on<br />the FACTS Sheet so that the filled-in FACTS Sheet for each relevant contract<br />covers no more than both sides of two 8 &frac12; x 11 inch pages." Does our<br />response need to be printed on both sides of the paper? Is there a page<br />limit for each individual Past Performance Fact Sheet?</p>
<p>A (21) Yes, the response needs to be printed on both sides of the paper and yes, there's a page limit (both sides of two pages).</p>
<p>Q (22) Is the page limit for each Fact Sheet 4 pages or 4 additional pages to the template in the RFP? We want to make sure we respond timely and correctly and as of now the Past Performance volume is to be submitted on Oct 11 (Columbus Day). We are preparing our proposal at our corporate office and would need to ship on Oct 7 to reach your office by Friday Oct 8. This answer is critical to our response.</p>
<p>A (22) See amendment 0001 extending receipt of Offers date.</p>
<p>Q (23) Our firm is preparing a bid for subject project and would like to know if there's any historical data that can be provided, i.e., number or personnel currently performing work, how many aircraft associated, T.O. changes, aircraft modifications, frequency of meetings, and is this strictly manpower support with emphasis on logistics, supply, and administrative support?</p>
<p>A (23) How many aircraft associated, T.O. changes, aircraft modifications, frequency of meetings, will not be provided unless described in a separate order. Yes, this is manpower support. The PWS at the order level will provide specifics.</p>
<p><br />Q (24) Page 53 of the RFP speaks to the relevancy criteria for the Past Performance. Specifically, "The effort must have included providing logistic support for Foreign Military Sales. The effort must have included at least 4 of the following support items: Supply and Deployment Support, Program and Logistic Support, Information Technology Support, Administrative and Timekeeping Support, Logistics Support of Multi-National Events."Information Technology Support and Administrative &amp; Timekeeping Support<br />don't match the PWS paragraphs 4.9.1 Administrative Support and 4.9.1 Technical Support. Shouldn't these match?</p>
<p>A (24) Amendment 0002 restated Information Technology Support, Administrative and Timekeeping Support to Technology Support and Administrative Support in section M of the RFP to match the PWS paragraphs 4.9.1 and 4.9.1.</p>
<p><br />Q (25) Can the government provide estimated man-hours per labor category<br />expected to be expended for the life of the new contract or any part thereof?</p>
<p>A (25) The government will not be providing this information.</p>
<p>Q (26) There is no requirement found in the PWS for IT support nor is there a<br />provision for IT labor categories.</p>
<p>a) Can the government provide clarification of the relevancy in the<br />Section M evaluation criteria regarding Information Technology (IT) (pg 53)?<br />b) Does the government wish the contractor to provide labor<br />category(ies) for IT?<br />c) What level/experience/qualifications should the IT professional<br />have?</p>
<p>A (26) There is a requirement for Technical Support rather than Information Technology Support. Amendment 0002 restated Information Technology Support to Technology Support to match the PWS paragraphs 4.9.1.</p>
<p>Q (27) Will the government allow additional labor categories such as Program/Project Managers? PWS paragraph 4.9.4.2 specifically identifies PM function but no provision is made for a labor category to execute the requirement.</p>
<p>A (27) Only those labor categories identified in RFP Attachment G, Proposed Loaded <br />Labor Rates will be considered. PWS paragraph 4.9.4.2 only addresses management of data/files not perform program management functions.</p>
<p>Q (28) Regarding the submission of proposals, Section L states "*All volumes shall be submitted in written form (1 copy) and CD-R or DVD-R (write once/read only) (1copy) that is "closed" so that no further writes can be made to the media." Does the government wish four separate CDs for each volume OR one CD containing all volumes?</p>
<p>A (28) The Government has no preference submitting one CD with all volumes on it or multiple CDs with one volume on each.</p>
<p>Q (29) Is the cost of contact required contractor training such as outlined in PWS paragraph 4.5.1, billable to the contract?</p>
<p>A (29) Training is not separately billed</p>
<p>Q (30) If so, will the government provide estimated man-hours to complete<br />required per contractor personnel under each delivery order?</p>
<p>Q (31) If not, will the government provide a CLIN to capture training costs?</p>
<p>A (30 &amp; 31 ) No, training is not separately billed</p>
<p>Q (32) In Attachment B - Past Performance Questionnaire, the instructions say to<br />call prior to faxing, however no point of contact or phone number is provided. Will the government please provide this POC information?</p>
<p>A (32) Reference Block 7 on cover page of the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />Q (33) Page 45 of the solicitation references FAR clause 52.222-46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees, which states that, "As part of their proposals, offerors will submit a total compensation plan setting forth salaries and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract." In which volume would the Government like offerors to include a copy of their Total Professional Employee Compensation Plan; Volume I or Volume IV?</p>
<p>A (33) Volume I Completed RFP</p>
<p>Q (34) RFP Section L reference PWS Paragraph 4.12 with respect to security requirements. Should this reference actually be to PWS Paragraph 4.13?</p>
<p>A (34) The correct reference is PWS paragraph 4.13. Correction has been addressed in amendment 0002.</p>
<p>Q (35) After looking at the RFP, I see that the NAICS code used is a $7M size standard. We had recommended the NAICS code 541330, "Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons" $27M size standard be used. If the current NAICS code is used, ___ cannot bid as a 8(a) small business. Is there a chance the 541330 NAICS code "Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons" $27M size standard can be used to broaden the competition. ____could bid with this code.</p>
<p>A (35) The NAICS code referenced in the RFP will be maintained.</p>
<p>Q (36) On page 50 of the Solicitation, paragraph (5) it states that the Offeror shall send out the Questionnaires and not delegate. Are the critical subcontractors allowed to send their own questionnaires to their Customers and track?</p>
<p>A (36) RFP page 50 states "The responsibility to send out and track the completion of the Present/Past Performance Questionnaires rests solely with the offeror - i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity."</p>
<p>Q (37) The PWS is non-specific with regard to levels of support - that is, it is absent any quantitative or schedule references to the number of aircraft and/or modifications to be supported, the number and types of material purchases to be performed, or the number an duration of the meetings to be supported - all of which are necessary to project the appropriate level of support for the scope of the effort. Please provide the government's estimate for these activities or, alternatively, provide historical data from previous years that could be used as one input in projecting the required support.</p>
<p>A (37) This will be provided on the task order basis<br /><br />Q (38) Section L D 5 of the solicitation states,</p>
<p>"The Offeror shall send out - and track the completion of - the present/Past Performance Questionnaires to each of the offeror's, critical subcontractors', teaming contractors' and/or joint venture partners; Points of Contact identified in each FACTS Sheet. The responsibility to send out and track the completion of the Present/Past Performance Questionnaires rests solely with the offeror - i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity."</p>
<p>Given that the subcontractors have established relationships with their POCs, would it be acceptable to have the Subcontractor submit their Past Performance Questionnaires to their POCs, or would that be considered a violation of the delegation prohibition contained in the above clause?</p>
<p>A (38) Violation - Offerors need to send in accordance with the following statement: "The responsibility to send out and track the completion of the Present/Past Performance Questionnaires rests solely with the offeror - i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity."</p>

These facilities shall be designed in accordance with DoDEA Education Facilities Specifications, AT/FP standards, Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines, National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code, Standards of Seismic Safety for Federally Owned Buildings, and energy conservation standards.
  Sustainable design principles will be included in the design and construction of the project in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 

In addition, there will be modifications to the existing building which will include replacing all of the existing windows and connections; 30 additional teacher mailboxes; a physical connection to the existing building at the north side; a physical connection to the existing building at the end of the east wing which will require replacement of existing double doors and the replacement of the existing fire alarm system with a mass notification/fire alarm system and extension of Data/Tel/PA to the new building from the existing building.

This acquisition is a 100% set aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns and the award of a firm-fixed-price contract is anticipated.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541310 and the applicable Small Business Size Standard is not more than $4.5 Million dollars average annual gross revenues for the past three fiscal years.

Address and acquire any permits required by Maryland Department of the Environment and any waivers required by the Maryland Historic Trust. Construction Documents: Maryland Historic Trust - All phases of design must comply with the Maryland Historic Trust and their recommendations.  Electrical - As determined by review of existing drawings plus field verification.  Mechanical - As determined by field survey as well as existing drawings and field verification.   Fire Protection - The buildings are to be fully protected with sprinkler systems and fire alarm equipment.

The three most qualified firms will be invited to interview with the selection board, and will again be numerically scored.  The firm with the highest score will be selected and asked to negotiate a fair and reasonable price.  Due to the need of multiple site visits and coordination on design reviews, consideration is limited to A/E firms with a working office located within a 120 miles radius of the VA Medical Center, Perry Point, Maryland 21902.  

Interested parties shall ensure current State Licensing, and shall have current registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://ccr.gov, verified status in 
VetBiz Information Pages (VIP) at http://vip.vetbiz.gov, and reporting to VETS 100 program, https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/vets100login.htm. 


 EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2010 - VERIFICATION OF STATUS OF APPARENTLY SUCCESSFUL OFFEROR

(a)  The apparently successful offeror, unless currently listed as verified in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) at:  www.vetbiz.gov database, shall submit to Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) within five business days of receipt of written notice of its status as the apparently successful offeror, a verification application in accordance with 38 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 74 with such reasonably adequate documentary material, as necessary, establishing as follows:

(1)  The owner or owners of 51 percent or more of the offeror is/are service-disabled Veteran(s), Veteran(s), or an eligible surviving spouse thereof, as applicable, for the instant acquisition.  In this regard, the apparently successful offeror shall submit a VA Form 0877 to CVE via VA's VIP at:  www.vetbiz.gov, internet site.  This confidential and secure electronic application will enable CVE to inform the CO of the service-disabled Veteran or Veteran status of the owner(s) of the offeror without the CO having to receive and secure confidential individually identifiable information or personal health care information on this topic.

(2)  Eligible parties own 51 percent or more of the concern (see 38 CFR 74.3).  Adequate documentation can include copies of official stock certificates, articles of incorporation, partnership agreement, operating agreement, or other similar documentation which reasonably demonstrates the percentage of ownership by eligible parties; and

(3)  Eligible parties control the concern (See 38 CFR 74.4).  Control includes both the strategic policy setting exercised, for example, by boards of directors, and the day to day management and administration of business operations.  Adequate documentation should include articles of incorporation, corporate by laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement, resumes, disclosure of any other current employment, or other relevant documentation, as applicable, which demonstrates control of the strategic and day to day management of the offeror by eligible parties, as applicable.

(b)  CVE will examine the business documents to determine if they establish appropriate ownership and control of the business from which an offer has been received.  Within 21 business days, CVE shall determine whether the firm can or cannot be verified as a SDVOSB or VOSB, as appropriate, and issue its decision thereon to the vendor in accordance with 38 CFR 74.11(e) and to the CO.  The CO will use CVE's decision in making the source selection decision.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION:  The Task Order DE-DT0000613 is a Time and Materials Task Order that was awarded to Peerless Technologies as an 8(a) set aside.  The Task Order is receiving additional American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding in the amount of $589,484.89 to cover the costs associated with the addition of two Program Managers for the period from October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011.
The scope for the additional two full-time equivalents (FTE) Program Managers is to serve as support for the DOE EM Recovery Act Project.  These individuals will provide real-time information on best practices, lessons learned and emerging issues.  These individuals will have specific responsibility for assisting sites with preparation of Critical Decision 4 (CD-4) documentation and Closure Report documents which address technical, programmatic, regulatory, environment, safety and health, (ES&H) and execution of site work funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act).  The incumbent functions as an extension of the Recovery Act Project Director to serve as liaison between the Headquarters Recovery Act Program Office, the EMCBC supporting offices, and field sites to facilitate the coordination and approval of required CD-4 and Closure Report documents.  
These duties are conducted in highly complex, unique sites and facilities where hazards to workers, the public, and the environment are non-routine and where potentially harmful consequences are significant, in an accelerated, high visibility, first-of-a-kind government initiative, with strict reporting and compliance requirements.
Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:
The work discussed herein is the same work that is currently required in the original task order statement of work as awarded.  Therefore, additional competition was not required.  The original Task Order was awarded as a Time and Materials/Cost Reimbursable contract.  The Line Items that were established as Cost Reimbursable were for travel costs and Other Direct costs allowable under the Task Order.  Modifying this Task Order to exercise an Option period does not change the risk assessment of the work, so maintaining a Time and Materials type is appropriate.  The contractor will be encouraged wherever possible to award subcontracts utilizing fixed price/competitive award.

The individual will perform cost/pricing analyses of pre-award and post-award proposals [including Requests for Equitable Adjustments (REAs)] and prepare reports incorporating results of the analyses performed on efforts funded in whole or in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act).
This individual will have experience in performing cost/pricing analyses of pre-award and post-award proposals [including Requests for Equitable Adjustments (REAs)] or experience in Government cost accounting oversight and financial internal controls to support the Environmental Management Consolidated Business Center, Office of Contracting.  
Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:
This Task Order was awarded as a Time and Materials/Cost Reimbursable contract, because of the uncertainty and unpredictability of subject Tasks/Requirements, and there is no other contract type that would be equally advantageous to the Government as a Time and Material (T&M) requirements for a Cost Analyst.  Placing this effort on a T&M requirement basis will remove the effects of many uncertainties and eliminates any contingencies of costs to the government which do not actually occur.  Surveillance for the task order will be provided by the Contracting Officer.  The Line Items that were established as Cost Reimbursable were for travel costs and Other Direct costs allowable under the Task Order.  The contractor will be encouraged wherever possible to award subcontracts utilizing fixed price/competitive award.

<DESC>USE OF LABOR HOUR CONTRACT
<p>The Internet Monitoring and Analysis Support contract is Labor Hour (LH) contract due to the inability to predict future criminal activity regarding expansive areas of content related to FDA regulated products. Since the nature of work can affect national security it is important to incorporate flexibility into the contract. OCI anticipates requiring standard services but may need the contractor to expedite deliverables or change focus to another area of content (within scope) within 24hrs.</p>
<p>FINDINGS<br />1. At this time, it is not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work, or of the anticipated costs with any degree of confidence.. <br />2. A cost-reimbursement contract would be unacceptable as the program office is unable to accurately describe the majority of the work to be performed, unable to estimate the costs up front and, consequently, unable to evaluate a cost proposal.<br />3. Services will be provided by the contractor utilizing the services of negotiated labor categories at specific fixed hourly rates. The hourly rates are fully burdened.<br />4.The Government anticipates materials and labor costs to be associated with some of the emergencies or national security efforts.<br />5.Government surveillance of contractor work / performance will be by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).</p>
<p>COMPETITIVE</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.203 the Internet Monitoring was competed. 17 proposals were received and an award was made without discussions based on best value to the Government.</p>

<DESC>FDA utilizes Empirica's Software Signal Detection Software agency wide to clean, standardize, and report information regarding FDA regulated product. FDA awarded Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract No. HHSF223201000061I with the ability to place time and material, Labor Hour, and Fixed Price task orders. FDA anticipates primarily issuing several firm fixed task orders against the subject contract since most of the work to be performed is streamlined and consists of standard Operations and Maintenance and can be defined as "Steady State Activities". But, due to a possible future need to receive additional customization and enhancement support services such as: training, integration, validation, production, and production roll-out the FDA has determined that it is in the best interest to give the ordering activity flexibility in determining task order type.
<p>FINDINGS<br />1. At this time, it is not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work, or of the anticipated costs, for the individual task orders&nbsp;to be placed&nbsp;against the subject contract with any degree of confidence.<br />2. A fixed-price contract type for all task orders placed against this contract would be unacceptable due to a lack of definite specifications and probable cost of performance. Also, there are performance uncertainties.<br />3. A cost-reimbursement contract would be unacceptable as the program office is unable to accurately describe the majority of the work to be performed, unable to estimate the costs up front and, consequently, unable to evaluate a cost proposal.<br />4. Services will be provided by the contractor utilizing the services of negotiated labor categories at specific fixed hourly rates. The hourly rates are fully burdened.<br />5. The Government anticipates materials and labor costs to be associated with some of the additional Signal Detection related tasks.<br />6. Government surveillance of contractor work / performance will be by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).</p>
<p>COMPETITION:</p>
<p>This requirement was competed in accordance with FAR part 6 procedures. 1 proposal was received in response to the combined synopsis solicitation posted on Federal Business Opportunities.</p>

<DESC><p>TASK ORDER NO.: HHSF223201002T OF IDIQ CONTRACT NO.: HHSF223201000061I<br /><br />USE OF LABOR HOUR<br /><br />The Task Order type is a combination of firm fixed price and labor hour line items.&nbsp; The labor hour component&nbsp;is for&nbsp;Customer Support Services&nbsp;and is less than 20% of the overall cost of the task order.&nbsp; <br /><br />The reason the Customer Support Services CLIN is Labor Hour is because it is based on the actual amount Helpdesk Calls received and the amount of new users per year.&nbsp; Although, the FDA sited maximum amounts in the solicitation it may be less, therefore it was more cost efficient to use Labor Hour.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Project No. 636A-10-311, Building 2 Storm Sewer Project,
VA Central Iowa Health Care System
Des Moines, Iowa

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity:  Requiring Agency is Des Moines VA, Engineering Services and the Contracting Activity is Central Iowa Health Care System, Contracting, Des Moines, IA

2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for Building 2 Storm Sewer at the VA Medical Center, Des Moines, IA.   This requirement falls under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 238990; with a small business size standard of $14 million.  The end result will be a Firm Fixed Price contract awarded under FAR Part 36 using Part 15 procedures.  This requirement cannot be fulfilled in-house as the Des Moines VA does not have the staff or the expertise to perform this requirement.  The VA Central Iowa Health Care System, Des Moines Division plans to award this requirement as a sole source to a Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), AWG Services LLC.

3.  A description of supplies/services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):  The Des Moines VA requires installation of a new catch basin near the building 2 loading dock to improve drainage in that area. This also includes running a drain line from the dock area under the grass area and sidewalk and connecting to current drain site and reasphalting as required on the Des Moines Iowa campus.  The estimated value of this requirement is of $200,000.00.  

4.  Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  This requirement is being set aside under Public Law (PL) 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006, which is codified at 38 U.S.C. Sections 8127 and 8128, and specifically, Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 819.7007 (Dec 2009); Each related award must be made to a responsible SDVOSB or VOSB at a fair and reasonable price as determined by the contracting officer.  The FAR authority cited is 6.302-5, Authorized by Statute. 

5.  Nature of the acquisition to meet the authority cited in Paragraph 4:  VAAR 819.7007 allows for a sole source acquisition to a SDVOSB.  As delineated in VAAR 189.7007 and pursuant to 38 U.S.C Section 8127(c), contracting officers may use other than competitive procedures (including sole source awards) for contracts to SDVOSBs and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs) where the anticipate price will exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, but not to exceed $5,000,000.00.   As delineated in VAAR 189.7007 and pursuant to 38 U.S.C Section 8127(c), contracting officers may use other than competitive procedures (including sole source awards) for contracts to SDVOSBs and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs) where the anticipated price will exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, but not to exceed $5,000,000.00.  Each related award must be made to a responsible SDVOSB or VOSB at a fair and reasonable price as determined by the contracting officer.  The contracting officer has determined AWG Services LLC as responsible.

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:  FAR 5.202(a)(4).The Des Moines VA normally solicits all construction requirements competitively through SDVOSB set asides.  In this instance there is a contract that was awarded earlier that provided for asphalt covering of parking lot 7W.  The VA will avoid paving Lot 7W lot twice by using the cited authority.  

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  A price negotiation memorandum, as required by FAR 15.405, will be prepared and included in the contract file upon completion of the negotiations.  The Contracting Officer will use other than cost and pricing data to include the independent government estimate, historical costs, fixed labor and materials costs.  The Contracting Officer will ensure that the agreed upon prices are in accordance with industry standards and are fair and reasonable.
8.  Description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted:  A search was conducted under the Dynamic Small Business search for SDVOSBs, and nine were found in the state of Iowa under the NAICS of 238990.  A search of Vet Biz found five companies under the appropriate NAICS code.  	

9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full open competition, such as: (i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.  (ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.  (iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government. ---   AWG Services LLC was awarded contract #VA263-C-1011 for the Asphalt Overlay for Parking Lots 1, 5 and 7W on June 29, 2010.  The drain line required for this project will run under parking lot 7W and will connect with an existing drain line located approximately 20 feet deep that lies under 7W.  This will involve extensive digging and trenching through the lot to run the new pipe and provide a hole large enough to connect to the existing line.  It will also require removing a portion of a concrete sidewalk and a curb around the parking lot.  The contractor will then repair the surface of the lot with asphalt, replace the adjoining sidewalk with concrete and replace the curb and gutters.  By using the same contractor to perform both projects the VA would avoid the expense of paving the lot twice and the lot would be out of service for a shorter period of time.   

10.  Listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing an interest in the acquisition:  None

11.  Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None, this is a one-time requirement for the Des Moines VA.

12.  Contracting & Technical Personnel Certification:  I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance included in this Justification and Approval are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  Therefore, I approve this procurement under other than full and open competition bases.
