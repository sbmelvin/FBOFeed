<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a custom pressure control system. Currently, NASA/MSFC owns and operates a custom pressure control system that was built using National Instruments components (NI).  A second system is required to support additional testing at an alternate location.  The new pressure control system hardware must be an exact duplicate of the current hardware setup to ensure repeatable performance and standardized calibration procedures between the two systems. Any differences between new hardware and the existing hardware would present a compatibility issue between the two systems.  This would make it very difficult to maintain software and schematic diagrams. The software used in the current system was written in Labview Real-Time (RT) programming language, an NI programming language.  Any attempt to purchase third party software could present compatibility issues with the Labview RT that NI would not support. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from National Instruments pursuant to FAR 13.106. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 23, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NA Chassis Dynamometer Upgrade Synopsis/Solicitation.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement  constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2001-13 (18 M arch 03) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), 1998 edition, and current to DCN 20030430.  The preferred method of payment is by Government Visa Credit Card.  This is acquisition is issued on an unrestricted basis.  The North Ameri can Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) is 811118 with a size standard of $6 million.  This requirement is for a Chassis Dynamometer Upgrade in accordance with the following requirements: Required delivery is 30 weeks after award with 30 days Installat ion and checkout.  Introduction: The purpose of this chassis dynamometer is to perform power-train testing on wheeled vehicle systems for the U.S. military.  The wheeled vehicles to be tested may be either tactical or combat systems that the U.S. military currently has in its inventory or may have in the future.  Commercially produced or foreign equipment may also be tested.  It should be expected that all vehicles will have multiple axle drive capability.  Future vehicles may have alternative drive systems  such as hybrid-electric, or fuel cell technology and may be driven by independent electric motors mounted at each axle.  If the upgraded dynamometer configuration allows, tracked vehicles may also be tested.  The chassis dynamometer is installed in an env ironmental chamber in which the temperature and humidity can be varied to simulate world-wide climatic conditions, from hot-humid tropical to frigid arctic.  Vehicles are tested to verify adequacy of drive trains and other systems for both performance and endurance.  The selected contractor will be responsible for the design, fabrication, installation, checkout, and proper function of the upgrades to the chassis dynamometer.  U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground will provide access to the environmental chamber and  chassis dynamometer as required to formulate the bid and to determine the physical characteristics of the existing design.  No drawings are available to show design details of the existing chassis dynamometer.  The existing dynamometer design consists of ten, 18 inch diameter roll sets mounted on a structural steel framework that is set into a 30 inch deep concrete pit.  Each roll set consists of two rolls positioned in the tread area, with an axle connecting them.  The chamber floor and dynamometer pit ar e installed on a thick layer of polyurethane foam insulation.  One roll set has two eddy current power absorbers installed for power absorption on one rear axle.   Upgrade Description: This chassis dynamometer upgrade is being done for the purpose of enabling power absorption at each axle of a multiple axle drive vehicle, having up to five drive axles.  Additionally, the upgraded chassis dynamometer system shall be a ble to control power absorption; a.  equally at all vehicle axles; b.  at each axle of a vehicle independently; c.  or at each wheel of a vehicle independently. Chassis Dynamometer Operational Characteristics: a.  The chassis dynamometer control will need to be operated at its location in a room adjacent to the chamber, and preferably to include a secondary control that can be used from inside the chamber during room-temperature test conditions.  b.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center (USCG R&DC) intends to contract with one or two marine radio manufacturers to integrate Global Positioning systems into Class D Digital Selective Calling (DSC) radios.  The goal is to maximize the probability that a DSC distress alert from a recreational boater will contain a valid position when received by the Rescue 21 System.  Rescue 21 is the replacement for the aging National Distress and Safety System (NDS) that is the United States primary maritime “911” system.  The USCG uses the NDS System to monitor for distress calls and coordinate search and rescue response.  The existing system is voice only.  It receives distress calls on VHF Channel 16 and is the primary means that a boater in distress calls for help if they are within twenty (20) nautical miles of the United States shore.  The current NDS System cannot receive DSC Channel 70 distress alerts.  DSC is an integral part of the new Rescue 21 System.  With Rescue 21, the Coast Guard will immediately be able to execute a rescue operation because they will not need to search for the vessel.  The contract will call for the development of two radios to go through acceptance testing with an additional forty-eight (48) being delivered under the base contract. The radios can either be hand held or fixed mount radios or a combination of both.  There will be options for either 100 or 500 additional radios to be purchased.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which the Coast Guard will consider.  The NAICS Code is 334220.  The Coast Guard intends to award one or two Fixed Price Contracts with Options which must be priced at time of award. The period of performance will be one year from date of award.  ATTENTION:  Minority, Women-owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs)!  The Department of Transportation (DOT), Short-Term Lending Program (STLP) offers working capital financing accounts receivable for transportation related contracts.  Maximum line of credit is $500,000 with interest at the prime rate.  For further information, call (800)532-1169.  Internet address:  http://osdbuweb.dot.gov.  For further information, contact Dinah Mulligan (860) 441-2885 or dmulligan@rdc.uscg.mil.

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that do not issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY – THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.  THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 236220 and the Small Business Standard is $27.5 million.  The General Services Administration announces an opportunity to qualified small business construction firms interested in providing construction services to renovate portions of the Internal Revenue Service Center in Covington, Kentucky.  The estimated cost range of the work is $250,000 - $500,000 and includes architectural renovations to the Child Care Center and Cafeteria, interior painting, and replacement of ceiling tiles.  The Government also intends to establish a Multiple Award, Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) Construction Contract for similar construction services for up to five (5) sources under this solicitation.  The contract will provide for general repairs and alterations to all Government owned and leased facilities from $100,001 to $5 million within the State of Kentucky.  Each award will be for a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year options.  This solicitation will utilize Source Selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15.1, or Best Value concept to evaluate offers and make selections.  Best Value provides the opportunity for cost/technical tradeoffs; therefore, award will not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offeror or the highest technically ranked offeror.

This is a market survey to locate potential sources for the production phase of the AN/ASN-128D Doppler/GPS Navigation Set (DGNS).  This entails the integration o f the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) based GPS receiver into the AN/ASN-128B Doppler/GPS Navigation Set (DGNS).  The modified AN/ASN-128B sets, to include the Control Display Unit (CDU) and the Signal Data Converter (SDC), when combine d with the RT-1193() Receiver Transmitter Antenna (RTA) is type designated as the AN/ASN-128D Doppler/GPS Navigation Set.  The AN/ASN-128D will be Army self-certifiable for IFR operations in National Airspace (NAS) IAW standards of TSO C-129 for enroute th rough non-precision approach.  Only software changes may be made to the existing CDU.  The new SDC must be compatible with the CDU and RTA.  The SAASM receiver and IFR capability will be embedded into up to 1268 DGNS systems currently integrated into the A rmy fleet of Black Hawk and Chinook aircraft.  Presently the Army has a contract with BAE Systems, Totowa, NJ for a two-year period, which involves embedding the SAASM card and IFR requirements into five AN/ASN-128B sets.  The prototype AN/ASN-128Ds will b e fully qualified for an airworthiness release.  The Government is not in possession of a complete technical data package for the AN/ASN-128D.  This follow-up contract will be a five-year IDIQ type contract and will offer an incentive for the selectee to d eliver a small quantity of modified sets early.  The modifications will be accomplished IAW the technical specification developed and approved at the conclusion of the current development contract.  Potential bidders must have the production facilities to demonstrate the capability to integrate the SAASM into an existing DGNS and meet First Article Test requirements.  Successful qualification, to include EMI testing, flight testing and operational field testing, and passing of the First Article Test, must o ccur prior to system fielding in 2nd Qtr FY05. Selectee will be required to upgrade the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s Software Engineering Environment (SEE) at Ft Monmouth, NJ to test maintain system software only.

This procurement will result in a firm-fixed-price contract.  The contract will be procured using Source Selection (negotiated) procedures, as it has been determined in accordance with FAR 6.401 to be the most appropriate method of contracting for the subject project.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors’ proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides best value to the Government.

This procurement is open to all business concerns.  The DFAR estimated cost range is between $25 Million and $28 Million.  The Government desires to award the greatest number of CLINS possible within the funds available for the project.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990.

The RFP will be issued at the 60% design submittal stage because of the design and construction time limitations.

The initial RFP will request proposals based on technical factors only.  The Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) will evaluate the proposals, conduct discussions with all offerors if advisable, and allow revised technical proposals if necessary.  An amendment will be issued to all offerors upon receipt of the Final Design Submittal to request submission of a price proposal based on the final design.  Offerors will be allowed to submit revisions to their technical proposal at this time if the amendment should result in significant changes.  The TEB will reconvene if revised technical proposals are submitted.  The best value determination will be made based on price and technical ratings.  

The anticipated Evaluation Factors for this procurement are as follows:  Factor I – Past Performance; Factor II – Experience; Factor III – Project Management Plan; Factor IV – Subcontracting Experience, Achievement, and Goals; Factor V – Price.  Proposals will be evaluated to determine which offer provides the best value to the Government.  

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all offerors prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR WITHOUT ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.

The solicitation will be provided for down load free of charge via the Internet World Wide Web at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil on or about 9 June 2003.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  Proposal submission place:  Mr. Wu Chengjian, Division Chief, Shanghai Environmental Protection Bureau, No. 161, Lane 1038, Huashan Road, Shanghai 200050, China, Tel: (8621) 6226-8110, Fax: (8621) 6226-6689.
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for construction of a centralized medical waste treatment facility in the Municipality of Shanghai.

Shanghai's population numbers over 17 million.  According to 1998 Shanghai Public Health Statistics Data there were 473 hospitals and other medical establishments in Shanghai area, with a combined daily average number of patients over 175,000.  The quantity of medical waste generated from these hospitals was estimated at 13,000 to 22,000 tons/year in the Shanghai area with an annual average growth rate of 5%.  Among the total quantity of medical waste, 85% of the waste was generated from the downtown area.

According to the National Catalogue of Hazardous Wastes, the medical waste from medical care in hospitals, medical centers and clinics mainly includes:

·	Clinical wastes (HW01)
§	Residues in operation and binding
§	Residues in biological culture and animal experiment
§	Residues in laboratory test
§	Infectious waste
§	Sludge from wastewater treatment
·	Waste pharmaceuticals, drugs and medicines (HW03)

Although many regulations and standards exist to regulate medical waste’s management and disposal, more focused attention is needed to build a centralized medical waste treatment facility in Shanghai.  Major problems exist in the current medical waste management and disposal system including poor design and inappropriate practices related to medical waste incinerators, illegal transportation, treatment and disposal of medical waste, economically unreasonable separation of medical waste management, and substandard treatment of disposable medical equipment.

The Grantee is cooperating with other related agencies to set up an integrated management control program that includes a collection system, secured transportation system, centralized treatment and disposal facility.  The proposed CMWTF will promote the centralized management and control of medical waste, reduce the economic cost and social cost of medical waste pollution control, avoid the risks and pollution caused by illegal transportation, recycling and disposal of medical waste, and improve environmental quality and sanitary conditions of the city.

The construction of the system and facilities will be completed through a phased approach.  Phase I – with a proposed capacity of 9,000 tons/year – would service 500 square kilometers in the downtown area.  Phase II, adding an additional 9,000 tons/year treatment and disposal capacity, would service an additional 1,000 square kilometers in downtown and suburban areas.  After the two construction phases are completed, total treatment capacity of the CMWTF will reach 18,000 tons/year that will cover the area of 1500 square kilometers of the downtown and suburban areas.  The Grantee has estimated the project budget for construction of the CMWTF to be $10.5 million.  

Medical waste generated by hospital activities has long been a critical factor contributing to China’s environmental problems.  Shanghai is one of the most developed and most populated areas in China.  However, there is no centralized facility in this area that meets the standards of the Grantee or the central government for properly treating and disposing of medical waste generated from the hospitals and medical institutions.   The need to build a centralized medical waste treatment and disposal facility is obvious and has been requested by the public.    The Commercial Service in Shanghai has confirmed that this is a high priority for both the central and local governments and one that is moving rapidly forward.

The Study will focus on the following seven tasks:
Task 1	Background Information Collection
Task 2	Confirmation of Medical Waste Generation in the Proposed Service Area
Task 3	Alternative Analysis for Collection, Transportation, Treatment, and Disposal of the Medical Waste
Task 4	Medical Waste Policy and Management System
Task 5	Cost Estimation and Financial Analysis for the Facility
Task 6	Recommendation
Task 7	Preparation of Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $204,900 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., June 20, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The Questions and Answers in response to the Solicitation are as follows: Question 1.  There appears to be a conflict of resource requirements in the solicitation.  In the Place and Period of Performance, and Security sections, it states that the Contract Personnel shall be on-site.   However, under the section C.1 STATEMENT OF WORK, The Contractor shall furnish the necessary... materials, facilities..., which appears to go against the rest of the specifications.  Are we to assume that this is an on-site, government furnished materials and facilities contract?   Will the governme nt fund the purchase of the PowerBuilder 9.0 upgrade and/or maintenance support of the PowerBuilder 8.0 development software?   ANSWER:  All work is to be performed on-site.  The Government Furnished Property/Supplies is listed under the Place and Period of Performance in Section C.  The Government will not fund the purchase of PowerBuilder 9.0 upgrade or maintenance support of the  PowerBuilder 8.0 development software. Question 2.  Are the proposed work hours reversed for a Senior Database Administrator labor category versus the Senior Program Manager position?   Our experience with ODCSOPS and client/server development indicates that the 900 hours of proposed Senior DBA  support is more indicative of application development versus the work normally associated with a DBA labor category.   ANSWER:  The hours are correct as stated.  An development will on be in modification of the current system.

Please direct any questions on this NOCA to ESC/DIVG, 45 Arnold Street, Hanscom AFB MA 01731-2103, Attn: Mr. Kent Kinal, Contracting Officer (tel: 781-377-1273, e-mail: kent.kinal@hanscom.af.mil) or Mr. Jeff Wong, Contracts Manager (tel: 781-377-2326, e-mail: Jeffrey.wong@hanscom.af.mil).

Minuteman and Peacekeeper Launch Facility (LF) and Launch Control Facility (LCF) Motor-Generators (M-G’s) are to be Repaired and Modified (NSNs 6125-01-034-3374AH, NSN 6125 00 539 0330AH, 6125 01 309 5870AH and 6125 01 309 5687AH).  Workload requirements will be variable and could vary from zero to 25 units per quarter.  The contractor shall receive, disassemble, inspect, test, fault isolate, perform maintenance and modify as required to restore the unit to the latest serviceable configuration. Repairs will require metalizing, sleeving, welding, cadmium plating, machining, rewinding, balancing, electronic modules/subassemblies dis-assembly/assembly and other repairs to return the components and equipment to drawing dimensions and updated configuration.    In order to maintain alignment of the single motor and generator shafts and prevent electrical knocking, extremely tight machining tolerances and precision assembly are required.  Special test equipment which can warm-up, burn-in, fault isolate and acceptance test the repaired motor-generators is required.  This requires variable dc supplies over ranges of 32.25 + 6.25 vdc and 162.65 + 25.85 vdc and a three phase variable ac supply with voltages from 82 to 132 volts and frequencies of 55-65 Hz.  Loads banks of: a 60 Hz 7.5 KVA single phase at power factors from 0.5 lagging to 1.0 and 8.3 KW at 0.5 and 1.0 power factor, a 400 Hz 7.5 KVA three phase at power factors from 0.5 lagging to 1.0, a single phase 5 KW full-wave rectified load for the 60 Hz M-G output, a three phase 5 KW and 2.6 KW full-wave rectified load for the 400 Hz M-G set output, a 60 Hz single phase load capable of operation up to 3.75 KW at unity power factor for warm up and burn in and a 400 Hz three phase load bank capable of operating up to 3.75 KVA at unity power factor for warm up and burn-in.  An ambient cooling air supply at 32 LB/min per minute is required for LCF motor-generators.  An electronic test bench is also required for testing electronic modules and subassemblies.  Measurement and recording of M-G vibration (displacement and velocity) is required.  The test equipment must measure and record each ac input phase voltage, frequency and current, the dc input voltage and current and each output phase (both 60 Hz and 400 Hz) voltage, current, and frequency.  A computerized data collection system is required to collect, store measured data and printout at end of the testing.   

 
The Motor-Generators are unique to the Minuteman and Peacekeeper Weapon Systems for supplying an un-interruptible operational source of power to Missile Launch Control and Launch Facilities.  The LF M-G units weighing 2130 lbs. consist of a 120/208 volt, 3 phase, 4 wire, 60 Hz induction ac motor and a 32 volt, 13.5 HP dc motor combined on a single shaft to drive an ac generator with an output voltage of 120/208 volts ac (+2%), 3 phase, 4 wire, 380 to 435 Hz with a power output of 7.5 KVA at any power factor from 0.5 lagging to unity. The unit incorporates an electronic control box, which monitors both input frequency and voltage and transfers the motor to dc in the event ac power goes out of tolerance.  The LCF M-G units weighing 3050 lbs. consist of a 120/208 volt, 3 phase, 4 wire, 60 Hz induction 27 HP ac motor and a 28 to 36 volt, 27 HP dc (Type I) motor or a 160 volt, 27 HP dc  (Type II) motor combined on a single shaft to drive 60 and 400 Hz generators.  The 60 Hz generator produces 60 Hz, 1-phase, 120-vac power.  The 400 Hz generator produces 400 Hz, 3-phase, 120/208-vac power.  The control enclosures contain an electronic voltage regulator and a motor-generator control assembly.  The voltage regulator contains a 400 Hz regulator, 60 Hz regulator, filters and connectors.  The motor-generator control contains an under voltage monitor, an under frequency monitor, power contactors and connectors.  The two monitor circuits sense the ac input voltage and frequency and allow switching to dc power if ac input power is out of tolerance.
 
Potential contractors must provide written verification and documentation of capabilities and facilities to perform the required repair, modification and testing efforts.  Verification should include a detailed description of similar equipment past and present that has been successfully repaired and a detailed list of equipment to accomplish the required efforts.  A detailed description of methods and procedures for quality control is also required.  Any other information that is indicative of the offerors capability to successfully perform this repair will be accepted.  The government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Release or distribution of your response will be approved by the contracting officer.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described effort make contact with the firm listed.  All interested, responsible, qualified offerors should submit two copies of a written response to: Cathie Richardson, OO-ALC/LMKA, 6014 Dogwood Ave., Hill AFB, UT 84056-5816, no later than 10 working days after publication of this notice.  No telephone or FAX requests will be accepted.

<DESC>The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architect-Engineering (A/E) Services for the design of a New Border Station in San Diego, California in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  The project proposes the reconfiguration of the existing San Ysidro Port of Entry at San Diego, CA.  Work involves demolition of this port of entry, including the primary and secondary inspection areas, head houses and agency office spaces.  Reconstruction work includes the widening of the northbound lanes, installation of up to 50 northbound primary inspection booths, construction of a new head house with a secondary inspection area and overhead canopies, and construction of new administrative office space for the inspection agencies.  In addition, a new southbound inspection facility will be constructed including primary and secondary inspection facilities and agency office space.  The gross square footage (gsf) of the administrative office space for the Port of Entry will be approximately 200,000 gsf.  The administrative offices will house the Office of Homeland Security (formally INS, US Customs, Border Patrol, USDA) and GSA.  The estimated total construction cost is between $100,000,000 and $125,000,000. 

The Government is anticipating the utilization of a traditional Design-Bid-Build, with pre-qualification of the General Contractors through FAR Part 15, approach as the preferred method of procurement of construction services.  However, the Government reserves the right to utilize an alternate method of procurement if economic and funding conditions change.  This A/E Services contract will include Pre-Design, Preliminary Concepts, and Final Concept.  Options for Design Development, Construction Documents and Construction Services will also be negotiated and may be exercised by the Government.  A/E design services will require, but are not limited to, preparation of drawings in metric, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, renderings, architectural models, computer-aided design & drafting (CADD) graphics, color/material selections and presentations, detailed design investigations, constructibility reviews, systems design and calculations, life cycle costing, value engineering, site design, client program requirements, space planning, contract documents, sustainable features towards a LEED certified design, and other similar services as determined to be required for each option.  The building shall be designed to GSA design standards for secure facilities, U.S. Land Port of Entry Design Guide (February 2001), Space Allocation Standards For District Offices and Sub-offices, INS (June 2001), Border Integrity Anti-terrorism Program Requirements of Sea Ports of Entry, INS (February 2002), and INS Holding Room Standards.  The reorganization of the federal inspection agencies into the Department of Homeland Security may affect the projects design Parameters.

The San Ysidro Port of Entry is located 17 miles south of downtown San Diego and is bounded by the community of San Ysidro on the United States side and the City of Tijuana, Mexico This new project will reflect the dignity of the U.S. Federal Government and invoke community pride.  The facility will become an integral part of the community and make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the overall environment and contextual features of the surrounding community, as well as local architectural styles.

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.

<DESC>Re: RFQ - Clarification and Updated Information Shared during the Informational Conference Call Project Title: Integrating ECR Evaluation Results into Practice
We would like to thank all those who took the opportunity to participate in our informational conference call. We hope the call proved informative and helped answer your questions regarding the RFQ. 
We would like to share updated information and answers to points raised during the informational call that affect all potential respondents.
(1) Revised timeline - The project timeline has been revised and the new start date is September 1, 2003 (the revised RFQ is attached). However, the response due date remains the same.  In order to be considered, submissions must be received before 5:00 PM Arizona time on Friday May 30, 2003. We anticipate that a selection will be made and contracting in place by the end of June 2003.
(2) Overhead expense - The Institute does not customarily pay additional charges for institutional overhead.  The Institute will, however, consider fixed price quotations that may have been arrived at by including some calculation of overhead. Such fixed price quotations will be evaluated in comparison with the total cost of other quotations.
(3) Allocation of project budget - It is anticipated that approximately 50% of the funding available for this project will be allocated to the statistical evaluation component.
Again our thanks for your interest in this project.
Regards,
Patricia Orr

REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS WITH REVISED TIMELINE

Project Title: Integrating ECR Evaluation Results into Practice

This is an announcement that the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution (the U.S. Institute) is soliciting quotations from qualified professionals to analyze and interpret evaluation data for environmental collaborative problem-solving and conflict resolution (ECR) cases.  Part of the effort will involve aggregate quantitative and qualitative analysis of new evaluation data and part will involve comparing the results of the analysis with findings in the published ECR literature. The goal of this project is to identify the key ingredients of ECR success, and to communicate these findings within the ECR field to improve practice. 

Background

The U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution is a federal program established by the U.S. Congress to assist parties in resolving environmental, natural resource, and public lands conflicts. The U.S. Institute serves as an impartial, non-partisan institution providing professional expertise, services, and resources to all parties involved in such disputes.  See www.ecr.gov for more information on the U.S. Institute.

In 1999, the U.S. Institute and the Policy Consensus Initiative (PCI) began an inquiry into the feasibility of developing program evaluation guidance for state and federal agencies that administer public policy and environmental conflict resolution programs. With funds from the Hewlett Foundation, PCI has extended the initial collaboration involving the U.S. Institute, the Massachusetts Office of Dispute Resolution and the Oregon Dispute Resolution Commission (ODRC) to additional states.  At the same time, the U.S. Institute has been working with federal agencies to enlist their cooperation and involvement.  The initial collaborative effort focused on developing a conceptual framework for evaluating ECR programs – a logic model of expected outcomes for each of the agencies’ program areas.  With respect to ECR cases, the logic model identifies necessary practice factors and a set of both process and agreement outcomes.  In addition, specific questionnaires were developed to collect data needed to measure the degree to which the practice factors were in place and the outcomes were achieved.  

The U.S. Institute, ODRC, and the Florida Conflict Resolution Consortium (FCRC) have adopted and are using the same theory of practice model and essentially the same questionnaires to evaluate their cases.  In addition, the U.S. Institute is working with several other federal agencies to evaluate their ECR cases.  This collaborative effort will produce an initial combined excel database collected in a consistent manner for 30 - 40 cases.  Analyzing this aggregate database and interpreting the results should add substantively to the growing body of information from other ECR research and evaluation efforts.
Project Partners 
The partners providing cases or case evaluation data for this study include:
-Oregon Dispute Resolution Commission
-Conflict Prevention and Resolution Center, Environmental Protection Agency
-Office of Collaborative Action and Dispute Resolution, Department of Interior
-Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
-Florida Conflict Resolution Consortium 
-Other state programs with available and compatible data sets.

Overview of the Project Inquiry
The aggregate analysis component of this evaluation effort will use the theory of practice model adopted by the U.S. Institute, ODRC and FCRC as the basis for this inquiry. (An overview of the U.S. Institute’s ECR evaluation system, a list of variables, and a draft ECR evaluation-report template are available under the section “What’s New–Upcoming Events” on the U.S. Institute website at www.ecr.gov.) The primary goal of this evaluation effort is to understand the key ingredients of success (i.e., achieving expected process and agreement outcomes). While exploring and explaining variations in achievement of outcomes, the relationships between variables such as practice factors and specific outcomes will be analyzed. The study results will also review the results from published ECR literature and compare and contrast the findings of the aggregate analysis with the findings in the published literature. Findings will then be framed in terms of learnings for program improvement and ECR practitioner training.

The types of questions to be addressed through this ECR evaluation effort (both the aggregate analysis and the review and synthesis of published ECR literature) include but are not limited to: 
1. What aspects of ECR best practices are most important for collaborative problem-solving and conflict resolution processes to be successful?
2. Which practices need to be employed more effectively by ECR practitioners and program managers? 
3. What is the relationship between the complexity of cases (duration of the controversy, the number of parties, etc.) and the process and agreement outcomes?
4. What is the relationship between the degrees to which best practice factors are employed and whether or not agreement is reached?
5. Which of the services provided by the neutral(s) are most important in determining the parties’ overall satisfaction with the neutral(s) and with the process?
6. Does prior experience of the parties with collaborative processes influence their level of satisfaction with ECR processes?
7. What elements of the process influence participants overall satisfaction with the process?
8. What factors influence the participants’ perspectives on whether the ECR processes are better than any other processes they are aware of?
9. What elements of the agreement (flexibility, parties understanding of the key elements of the agreement, etc.) influence whether the participants feel the agreement will last?
10. To what extent does reaching agreement affect participants’ satisfaction with the process?
11. In cases where full agreement is not reached, what factors influence (positively or negatively) satisfaction with the process?

Required Professional Expertise

It is anticipated that a two- or three-member analysis and review team will be assembled to perform the required tasks (one member may be qualified to perform more than one function and individuals may submit responses for more than one of the described team roles).  The team will reflect the following competencies:  
-Statistical evaluation – a program evaluation expert who is familiar with evaluation in the ECR field, and possesses methodological expertise needed to design and interpret the results of aggregate analyses of case data, and possesses (or has access to) analytical skills needed to conduct such analyses;
-The ECR research – a recognized expert in research on the effectiveness of ECR and public involvement activities, will be thoroughly familiar with the associated literature, and will be able to assess the rigor and generalizability of the findings of both the aggregate case analysis and of other empirical studies; and
-The ECR practice – an experienced facilitator of collaborative planning and problem solving processes and/or a mediator of environmental disputes, who is a recognized leader in the field, and who has the expertise to assess the utility of the evaluation findings to ECR practice.

Individual statements of interest and quotations will be solicited from and individual contracts will be negotiated with each member of the analysis and review team.  The U.S. Institute also encourages interested candidates to identify and assemble a complete team and to submit a combined response. 

 
PART A: STATISTICAL EVALUATION
Scope of Work
The U.S. Institute is seeking an evaluator with statistical expertise to:
1. Conduct aggregate statistical analysis of ECR case data from several similar data sets.
2. Work with the other members of the review team to distill and interpret key findings from the aggregate analysis and the published results from other ECR studies.
The successful candidate will be responsible for the research design in consultation with the other team members, and the U.S. Institute staff. The candidate will conduct the aggregate case data analysis and address data reliability and validity issues. The candidate will report results in the form of presentation slides as well as a brief written evaluation report. Both report formats should summarize the findings, describe the statistical relationships, interpret the findings of statistical results, in light of the key questions to be addressed and the implications for ECR practice. 
The candidate will work with the other members of the team to review key findings from the aggregate analysis and compare these results with published results from other studies. The candidate will assist the other team members in preparing a draft report of the combined findings for distribution to a broader review group (i.e., approximately 30 practitioners, program managers from state and federal ECR programs, trainers, and researchers). The candidate will present the study findings at a two-day workshop with the broader review group to be held in Tucson in January 2004. The candidate will also participate in workshop discussions assisting with the identification and prioritization of significant themes or issues for communication to the field to improve practice.
 
Evaluator Qualifications 
Specific qualifications and expertise sought are listed below: 
-Training and extensive experience in quantitative research methods and statistical analysis (experience with Excel and SPSS preferred).
-Training and experience with program evaluation.
-Familiarity with ECR.
-Ability to work both independently and collaboratively.
-Ability to communicate professionally and effectively, both orally and in writing.
-Available September 2003 – February 2004 to complete project related work and participate in project related activities.
The Contractor will be selected by and contract with the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution. The U.S. Institute will provide project oversight.
 
PART B: Researcher/Practitioner

Scope of Work
The U.S. Institute is seeking two ECR researchers and/or practitioners to help design, organize, and review findings from the aggregate ECR case data analysis (conducted by the team evaluator) and the published results of other ECR studies, state program evaluation efforts, and other recently published research pertinent to improving ECR. 
The successful candidates will be responsible for providing input to the research design for the aggregate ECR case data analysis. The candidates will conduct and compile a literature review of recent evaluation and research findings pertinent to improving ECR.  The candidates will systematically review and synthesize the findings from the aggregate case data analysis and the published results of other studies to distill from this work the key findings on ECR success that will be useful to practitioners and program managers working in the ECR field. The candidates will be responsible for submitting a draft report of findings (including the literature review) to the U.S. Institute for distribution to a broader review group (i.e., approximately 30 practitioners, program managers from state and federal ECR programs, trainers, and researchers). The candidates will also present the preliminary findings at a two-day workshop with the broader review group in Tucson in January 2004.

Researcher/Practitioner Qualifications 
Specific qualifications and expertise sought are listed below (note, we are looking for two team members.  Each may have strengths primarily as an ECR researcher with knowledge of ECR practice, or as an ECR practitioner with knowledge of research methods). However, a single candidate with strong credentials as both a researcher and practitioner could qualify for both roles:
-Extensive knowledge of and experience with environmental conflict resolution (ECR) processes, either from a research or practice perspective.
-Familiarity with research methods (an ECR practitioner), or expertise with research methods and familiarity with statistical techniques (an ECR researcher).

<DESC>MODIFICATION

This modification replaces previous announcement HQ0006-03-0-0000 posted on 5 May 2003.

In January 2002, the Secretary of Defense directed the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) provide the US, its allies, deployed forces, and friends with a layered ballistic missile defense system. This ballistic missile defense system defeats missiles of all ranges and in all phases of flight. 

The Director, MDA, took the Secretary’s direction and tasked the Kinetic Energy Interceptors Program Office to develop a program yielding a kinetic boost/ascent phase capability against Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles and Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles as soon as practical.  The Director further requested a competitive program rapidly delivering capabilities to the BMDS test bed.  

The existing program strategy consists of two major efforts.  We plan to use a capability-based acquisition with the goal of determining what capability can be delivered, when.  
Contracts were recently awarded to two teams for the definition of a mobile, terrestrially based, boost/ascent test bed element.  The contractors’ efforts focus on delivering as early as Block 08 (January 2008-December 2009).  The second element invests in the development of a space-based interceptor test bed.

The Kinetic Energy Interceptors Program Office seeks information regarding industry’s ability to design, develop, and implement a space based test bed for ballistic missile defense interceptors.  Industry responses to this RFI will be used to develop the Government’s acquisition approach.   We envision a strategy resulting in a best value acquisition with full and open competition.  

Information desired at this time:

1. Executive Summary:
1.1	 What type of program planning and strategy would you propose?  
1.2	 What is your proposed technical approach?
1.3	 What is your proposed business approach?

2. Describe a recommended approach to design, develop and implement a space based test bed:
2.1 What is the general design concept?
2.2 What is the basic functionality required in a space based test bed? What is the key functionality required to enable an operational capability?
2.3 How would you allocate those functions within and between the different element segments (space and ground)?
2.4 What is the enabling technology for a space based test bed? How mature are the components used in the design?
2.5 How mature are the production and manufacturing processes you plan to employ?
2.6 What is the ground operations concept? 
2.7 What test and evaluation assets and infrastructure are needed to support the operation of a space test bed?
2.8 What is the spiral development path of a space based test bed? What advances are required for each spiral?

3. Describe a high confidence development and test schedule for these production representative (stable configuration, built in a manufacturing facility by manufacturing personnel) space based interceptors for test:
3.1 What are the key development milestones and tests necessary to build and test a production element?  When do these events occur?
3.2 What is the necessary flight test progression to produce three intercepts with production representative interceptors?
3.3 What are the key production processes that should be employed?
3.4 What processes should be used to ensure mission success?

4. Identify Production Off-ramp Opportunities:
4.1 What is your operational concept?
4.2 How can you trace your test bed concept to an operational concept?
4.3 What is the schedule for producing and deploying an operational concept?
4.4 What is your launch segment concept? 
4.5 What is the boost/ascent performance of your operational concept against ballistic missiles of various types and ranges?
4.6 What is the inherent midcourse capability of an operational concept?
4.7 What Ballistic Missile Defense System sensor (s) and/or Command and Control, Battle Management and Communication capabilities are required to enable your approach?

5. Contact information:
5.1 Company name, address and primary engineering and program management points-of-contact with name, phone number and email address.
5.2 Provide a brief description of current and/or previous spacecraft and ballistic missile defense interceptor development experience.

If you have questions related to this RFI, please contact Mr. Fred Renz, frederick.renz@bmdo.osd.mil. The Program Office will respond individually to each request. Your response to the RFI should be received at MDA no later than 4:00 PM EDT, 18 June 2003.

The Program Office will conduct an Industry Day regarding a potential procurement in August 2003. 





Instructions for responses:
You may submit your response, not to exceed 20 pages or 40 scripted power point charts, either electronically (soft copy) or physically (hard copy).  Proprietary information may be submitted; however, industry is advised that restrictions that inhibit the Government’s ability to disclose the information within the Missile Defense Agency may preclude us from considering that information in developing the acquisition approach. 

Information submitted by industry will be reviewed by MDA and support contractor personnel. Personnel from the following firms will be involved in the review:

Millennium Engineering and Integration		
Modern Technology Solutions, Incorporated	
Andrulius Corporation

Unless clearly marked otherwise, submission of a response to this RFI signifies agreement to allow personnel from the above-listed firms and from MDA to use the information to develop the acquisition approach.
		

Technical Point of Contact:

Mr. Richard S. Matlock
Richard.Matlock@bmdo.osd.mil
703 695-6637
MDA/KI

Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future competition, nor will information provided in response to this RFI be used to exclude anyone from responding to any future Request for Proposals.  

THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ULTIMATELY ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR AWARD A CONTRACT.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.

<DESC>This modification will extend the approximate response date from May 8, 2003 to June 23, 2003. The National Park Service (NPS) is seeking one or more nursery or plant propagation organizations to propagate native plants for National Parks in Alaska, Arizona California, Colorado, Kansas, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, South Dakota Texas, Washington and Wyoming.  The government may elect to award a single task order contract or to award multiple task order contracts for the services to be provided by two or more sources under this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award contracts, based on the selection board's final selection list, in order of preference of the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work.  Offerors need not have experience in all states listed in order to be selected.  Specialists in particular ecosystems are encouraged to apply.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued.  The government will use such factors as past performance, quality of deliverables, cost-control, or other factors that the Contracting Officer, in the exercise of sound business judgment believes are relevant to the placement of orders.  Interested firms are encouraged to team with subconsultants as needed to meet scope requirements. The selected firm(s) shall be able to perform the following tasks: prepare revegetation plans and provide technical assistance in the field of native plant revegetation and ecological restoration;  collect seed and cuttings; propagate native plants from NPS genetic stocks; locate and provide plants when strict genetic considerations are not applicable; hold and care for plants in the contractor nursery if project delays require; prepare planting sites; control exotics; salvage plants from designated areas; install seed and plants; construct or apply plant protective devices or substances; provide plant establishment care; and monitor revegetation/restoration success.  NPS genetic conservation policy: The National Park Service policy calls for the preservation of native plant communities and their genetic resources wherever possible in natural zones. Accordingly, road slopes and other large areas intended to support self-sustaining native plant communities will usually be restored with local genetic stocks of native species. Most propagation requested under this IDIQ will require use of seed or cuttings native to areas which the NPS will designate as appropriate for a particular project.   Genetic policy is less stringently applied for landscaping around developed areas. Depending on the site, the project time frame, and the importance of genetic issues there, large landscape plants may be custom-grown or they may be provided from sources other than park gene pools. Preferably provided plants will be site-adapted (i.e., from genetic stocks likely to survive at the project site). Materials to be produced or supplied: The types of materials to be produced include, but are not limited to: trees and shrubs in seedling, 1 gallon and 5 gallon sizes; and grasses and forbs in plugs, tubelings and other small containers.  For areas where a more mature landscape is desired and genetic integrity is not crucial, the contractor may be requested to provide the same sizes of materials from sources that are likely to survive well at the project site. The scope of work includes but is not limited to the following:  1.  Revegetation Consulting: Utilizing NPS regulations and policies, prepare revegetation plans or sections of plans for park projects or provide technical assistance to park staff.  Plans may include, but are not limited to, analyses of soil resources, recommendations for soil salvage, topsoil storage, and soil amendments; seeding and planting prescriptions; installation techniques;  plant protection, supplemental watering and establishment care;  work scheduling, and cost estimating. 2. Seed and Cutting Collection: Collect seed, cuttings and native soil for mycorrhizal inoculum from within designated national park areas. Provide all labor, materials, equipment, supplies, and transportation needed to collect seed and cuttings for plant propagation. 3. Plant Propagation: Provide a permanent greenhouse/nursery facility with heat, water, fertilizer, insecticides, fungicides, and photo periods as needed to ensure the propagation of healthy seedlings. Stock under production must not interbreed with other ecotypes of the same species and potting mix must not be contaminated with weed or species alien to the designated park. Provide appropriate measures of hardening and site adaptation to prepare stock for successful transplanting into the park. Records must be maintained throughout production and provided to the National Park Service. 4. Plant Provision: Provide native seed and plants in sizes ranging from seedlings to 2" caliper trees that are native to the designated park and adapted to the environmental conditions at the project site, but not necessarily from local genetic stocks. 5. Holding: Provide holding for plant materials which will ensure healthy stock if there are changes in the delivery date. Include repotting when necessary. 6. Site Preparation: Prepare soil as needed, including scarification and addition of appropriate soil amendments. Install erosion control measures as needed. 7. Exotics Control: As appropriate and acceptable in the designated park, utilize hand pulling, clearing, tilling and chemical application practices to control exotic species at the revegetation site before and after installation. 8. Plant salvage and direct transplant: Dig native plants mechanically or by hand from designated areas only. Plants will range in size from seedlings to 2-inch caliper or larger. Hold in storage areas. Provide care during storage. 9. Installation: Deliver and install seed and plant material. As directed, mulch and perform other associated planting practices. Provide a one-year guarantee for plants installed by the offeror. 10. Protection: Provide protection from human trampling, and surface and underground predators as needed. Methods may include protective netting, photo-degrading protector tubes and repellents, and temporary fencing. 11. Follow Up Care: Provide, upon request, care for revegetation installations until the plants are established (approximately 2-3 years) .Care to include exotics control, weeding and irrigation as needed. Provide written progress reports as needed. 12. Monitoring: Establish baseline conditions and monitor revegetation success following installation for a period of 1- 5 years, depending on the situation.  The National Park Service will award an indefinite quantity contract to one or more successful offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  Individual task orders will be placed to order services as they are required and the funding becomes available.  The total of all task orders per year will not exceed $1,000,000.  The maximum task order amount will not exceed $200,000.  The selected firm(s) is guaranteed a minimum amount of $25,000 throughout the life of the contract.  The term of the contract shall be one year with four additional one-year options.  This procurement is set aside for small business concerns. The Standard Industrial Code for this procurement is 113210.  To the fullest extent, the NPS welcomes the participation of women and minority-owned and operated firms.

The Study will serve as an information technology procurement plan and provide tender documents for the new system.

Elements of the project’s scope of work will include the following: (i) examine current functions to determine what IT solution(s) will provide management with timely and accurate data to enhance customer service; (ii) determine what IT must be implemented in the customer care business processes; (iii) examine current facilities and recommendation of modernizing, upgrading and expanding these facilities in the future, and the costs of these actions; (iv) ensure compatibility of existing and planned IT systems; (v) consider the need and location for one or more call centers; (vi) identify software and hardware and provide cost estimate per call center; (vii) prepare specifications for off-the-shelf technology solutions and hardware that will fit client’s needs; (viii) estimate cost of purchase, installation, licensing fees, initial training of a basic operating staff, and maintenance; (ix) prepare the procurement plan to include a timetable and milestones; procurement plan will include a pilot project to be conducted by the successful bidder(s); and (x) recommend the composition of a Steering Committee to oversee the procurement and implementation process.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $306,476 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The following information is provided to clarify the Request for Information.  The date and time for receipt of information remains unchanged.  
This RFI is solely for the purpose of obtaining a capability statement
and a rough order of magnitude from interested parties. The capability
statement should be a top level document that illustrates the vendor’s
ability to perform the work described in the RFI. Specifically, the
vendor should address the following items in there capability statement:
1. The adequacy of the SOW, 2. The ability to meet the requirement via a
COTS package, 3. Timeframe to implement, and 4. Rough order of
magnitude. No additional documents are currently available for this
requirement, therefore, the vendor’s capability statement should address
only the requirements outlined in the RFI. In the event that this RFI
results in a procurement, a detailed requirements statement will be
provided. The rough order of magnitude should just be a "ball park"
figure and will not be used as a means of eliminating any potential
vendors from a possible competition for this work. NOAA will use the
capability statements and rough order of magnitudes to determine if it
will proceed with a procurement. At this time, NOAA has not determined
if a procurement will be conducted as a result of this RFI. The due date
for the documents associated with this RFI is May 23, 2003. If you have
any further questions, please e-mail the Contracting Officer, Ms. Loren
M. Sunell, at loren.sunell@noaa.gov

<SUBJECT>91--XENON CAPABILITY BY INDUSTRY TO SUPPORT NASA ION PROPULSION SYSTEMS
<SOLNBR>03-KPK-001
<RESPDATE>062003

<CONTACT>Lisa	Morales, Contract Specialist, Phone (321) 867-3860, Fax (321) 867-1188, Email lisa.morales-1@ksc.nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/KSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Xenon capability to support NASA Ion Propulsion Systems. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. NASA is expecting to have increasing requirements for Xenon used as a propellant in electrically powered ion propulsion systems as was demonstrated in the N-Star engine on the Deep Space 1 spacecraft.  Some geo-synchronous communication satellites are using smaller versions of the ion engine with a few kilograms of Xenon propellant on-board.  However, NASA plans to have much larger systems deployed on future spacecraft with on-board quantities of initially several hundred kilograms using solar-electric powered ion engines.  Even larger systems could result from potential nuclear-powered systems for outer-planet exploration missions under the new Project Prometheus. The current industry standard Xenon logistics of 5500 kPa pressure gas in 9 kg capacity cylinder would prove to be a logistics challenge to support these future missions.  Having to load a spacecraft ion propulsion system from say, 50 Xenon cylinders would certainly be labor intensive and may likely result in contamination and/or loss of valuable Xenon.  NASA is seeking industry input on innovative technologies to provide for much higher pressures (on the order of 10,000 kPa) and individual container quantities of 500 kg.  The goal is to develop a robust, efficient logistics system to deliver high-purity Xenon at high pressure into space flight systems with a minimum of on-site processing, re-containerization, etc.  Pumping units, final filtration, and similar activities are acceptable while loading spacecraft systems.  NASA desires to have simple delivery and loading processes similar to the current state-of-the-art for storable hypergolic liquid propellants (hydrazines & N2O4). As the NASA center of excellence for launch and payload processing systems, KSC is seeking industry ideas on potential technologies and processes to accomplish the goal of delivering 500 kg of Xenon into a 10,000 kPa pressure spacecraft propulsion system.  The first use of such a system could support the DAWN mission scheduled for launch in May 2006.  Xenon purity requirements are listed in below: Useful links: DAWN Mission: http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/dawn/index.html Project Prometheus: http://spacescience.nasa.gov/missions/prometheus.htm KSC Propellants: http://propellants.ksc.nasa.gov/ Xenon purity, 99.999% by difference Contaminant with the Limit, max ppm by Vol. Oxygen (0.1), Water H20 (.01), Carbon Monoxide CO (0.5), Carbon Dioxide Dioxide CO2 (0.5), Carbon Tetraflouride CF4 (0.1), Total hydrocarbons as methane (0.1), Nitrogen (1), Hydrogen (2), Krypton (5), Argon (1) Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.   All responses shall be submitted to Chuck Davis, Storable Propellants Engineer, NASA, Mail Code: TA-E3, KSC, FL 32955.  Phone 321-867-4748, fax 321-867-7369, email chuck.davis@nasa.gov no later than June 20, 2003.

<DESC>The following information is provided to do a Market Survey of Industry to determine potential contractors, in addition to Ducommun Technologies, Inc., who have the skills, experience and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort. Minuteman and Peacekeeper Launch Facility (LF) and Launch Control Facility (LCF) Motor-Generators (M-G?s) are to be Repaired and Modified (NSNs 6125-01-034-3374AH, NSN 6125 00 539 0330AH, 6125 01 309 5870AH and 6125 01 309 5687AH). Workload requirements will be variable and could vary from zero to 25 units per quarter. The contractor shall receive, disassemble, inspect, test, fault isolate, perform maintenance and modify as required to restore the unit to the latest serviceable configuration. Repairs will require metalizing, sleeving, welding, cadmium plating, machining, rewinding, balancing, electronic modules/subassemblies dis-assembly/assembly and other repairs to return the components and equipment to drawing dimensions and updated configuration. In order to maintain alignment of the single motor and generator shafts and prevent electrical knocking, extremely tight machining tolerances and precision assembly are required. Special test equipment which can warm-up, burn-in, fault isolate and acceptance test the repaired motor-generators is required. This requires variable dc supplies over ranges of 32.25 + 6.25 vdc and 162.65 + 25.85 vdc and a three phase variable ac supply with voltages from 82 to 132 volts and frequencies of 55-65 Hz. Loads banks of: a 60 Hz 7.5 KVA single phase at power factors from 0.5 lagging to 1.0 and 8.3 KW at 0.5 and 1.0 power factor, a 400 Hz 7.5 KVA three phase at power factors from 0.5 lagging to 1.0, a single phase 5 KW full-wave rectified load for the 60 Hz M-G output, a three phase 5 KW and 2.6 KW full-wave rectified load for the 400 Hz M-G set output, a 60 Hz single phase load capable of operation up to 3.75 KW at unity power factor for warm up and burn in and a 400 Hz three phase load bank capable of operating up to 3.75 KVA at unity power factor for warm up and burn-in. An ambient cooling air supply at 32 LB/min per minute is required for LCF motor-generators. An electronic test bench is also required for testing electronic modules and subassemblies. Measurement and recording of M-G vibration (displacement and velocity) is required. The test equipment must measure and record each ac input phase voltage, frequency and current, the dc input voltage and current and each output phase (both 60 Hz and 400 Hz) voltage, current, and frequency. A computerized data collection system is required to collect, store measured data and printout at end of the testing. The Motor-Generators are unique to the Minuteman and Peacekeeper Weapon Systems for supplying an un-interruptible operational source of power to Missile Launch Control and Launch Facilities. The LF M-G units weighing 2130 lbs. consist of a 120/208 volt, 3 phase, 4 wire, 60 Hz induction ac motor and a 32 volt, 13.5 HP dc motor combined on a single shaft to drive an ac generator with an output voltage of 120/208 volts ac (+2%), 3 phase, 4 wire, 380 to 435 Hz with a power output of 7.5 KVA at any power factor from 0.5 lagging to unity. The unit incorporates an electronic control box, which monitors both input frequency and voltage and transfers the motor to dc in the event ac power goes out of tolerance. The LCF M-G units weighing 3050 lbs. consist of a 120/208 volt, 3 phase, 4 wire, 60 Hz

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the electrical, natural gas, water distribution and wastewater collection systems at Hill Air Force Base, Utah.  The main lies approximately 30 miles north of Salt Lake City adjacent to Interstate 15.  Hill AFB includes the main base (6,700 acres), Little Mountain Test Annex (740 acres, 100 miles distant) including Bovine Mountain (145 miles distant), Grassy Mountain (92 miles distant), Confusion Peak near Trout Creek (215 miles distant) and Boulder WY (245 miles distant).  These locations include 1546 buildings (14,265,621 SF) set on 961,784 acres.  Much of the utility systems on Hill AFB and UTTR are located in an explosive hazard area. 

Electrical System:  Power is supplied by Utah Power and Light over two 46.1 kV overhead transmission lines.  Other electric providers to remote areas include: Wells Rural Electric, Bridger Valley Electric, Raft River Electric, and Mt. Wheeler Electric.  The main base distribution system includes approximately 200 miles of 12.0 kV circuits, two-thirds of which are overhead and one-third underground.  The overhead portion are mostly bare copper conductors suspended on wooden poles.  The underground portion consists of cable in duct banks, although there is some direct burial cable.  Pole- or pad-mounted transformers are used to step the voltage down to the required utilization level.  Four substations are controlled by a “Supervisory Controlled Automated Data Acquisition” (SCADA) computer system.  Typical utilization voltages are 277/480-volt three-phase, 120/208-volt three-phase and 120/240 volt single-phase.  The electrical system includes street and traffic lighting along with airfield lighting and security lighting.

Natural Gas System: The Questar Gas Company delivers gas to the base at several delivery and metering points around the perimeter of the base, with the primary supplier being IGI Resources of Idaho.  Gas is delivered at a pressure of 350 pounds, while distribution on-base is primarily underground at a pressure of 35 pounds.  There are approximately 44 miles of underground piping in sizes ranging from ¾ to 8 inches, 70 gas meters, and 1500 regulators (200 of which have been recently replaced).  Approximately 80% of the underground system is polyethylene installed in the past ten years.  The remaining 20% is 14-year-old steel pipe serving several housing areas.  Natural gas is also provided to Little Mountain and UTTR North, each with one delivery point that is regulated and metered.

Potable Water System:  Water is produced on-base by six permitted wells; an additional three wells must be repaired.  Water treatment is by chlorination, fluoridation and phosphate added at each well.  The Weber Basin Conservancy District supplies supplementary potable water.  There are approximately 187 miles of distribution piping in the main system, including cast iron, ductile iron, asbestos-cement and polyvinyl chloride pipes ranging in size from 1.5 to 24 inches in diameter, as well as approximately 13,000 valves.  The potable water system includes approximately 1200 backflow preventers, an automated lawn irrigation system and three swimming pools.  Storage is provided by one elevated metal tank, two ground level metal tanks, and three below-ground concrete tanks, with tank sizes varying from .8 to 3.5 million gallons.  The main system was originally constructed in the 1940s and expanded in the 1950s and 1960s.  In addition to the major system on-base, two minor systems serve Little Mountain and UTTR North.

Sanitary Wastewater System: The wastewater utility consists of one major system on-base and two minor systems at Little Mountain and UTTR North; these systems were originally constructed in the 1940s and expanded in the 1950s and 1960s.  Wastewater from the main base is discharged to the North Davis County sanitary sewer system through four flow meters.  The main system includes 19 pump stations, 14 septic tank systems and 4 holding tanks; the main system also includes approximately 200 miles of vitrified clay, polyvinyl chloride and cast iron piping ranging in size from 4 to 15 inches in diameter.

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  HOWEVER, BE ADVISED THAT SOLICITATION ISSUANCE IS ANTICIPATED ON OR ABOUT AUG 04, 2003.  

Vendors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought including, commercial market information and company information via e-mail or facsimile (703-767-9410) to Bobby Jones, no later than June 03, 2003.

<SUBJECT>R -- Upgrading and Supporting RW CAREWare Software
<DESC>EPS Draft
 For 
231-HAB-015-03-HA
May 19, 2003
The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA), HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB), intent to negotiate, on a sole source basis, to modify our contract with Jeff Murray’s Programming Shop of New Orleans, Louisiana.  This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Contract by Negotiation Procedures as outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.  The purpose of this negotiation is to acquire their Upgrading and Supporting RW CAREWare software, which will allow direct extensions of the current application and therefore enable its use in international HIV treatment settings.  This modification to the existing contract will permit changes in internal codes and redesign of certain screens of the current proprietary software.  The current contractor is the only one who can make these adjustments.           
The Contractor has spent a considerable amount of effort in developing the Upgrading and Supporting RW CAREWare software and will do this work with a large portion of the effort as an in-kind contribution.  Any other source would have to duplicate a substantial array of current and previous efforts to accomplish the same objectives.  
This is not a solicitation.  This is a notification of our intent to modify an existing contract.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file. 

Cite solicitation #231-HAB-015-03-HA when corresponding.  WE WILL RESPOND TO WRITTEN CORRESPONDENCE ONLY.

See Note 22

The scope of this contract is to secure the following Level II Stream Survey Services: 


1.	Purpose
The purpose of this solicitation is to perform Pacific Northwest Region 6 Level II stream surveys (also known as stream inventories) located within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest (GPNF).  Stream surveys shall be performed in conformance with the protocol Stream Inventory Handbook: level II, Pacific Northwest Region (Region 6), 2002.

Data collected shall include biological information describing fish communities observed.  Field data shall be gathered and presented to the Government for each stream surveyed within GPNF.  The contractor shall interpret the habitat condition in a stream survey report format.  The Forest Service will review and comment on the interpretations before final completion of reports.  All recommendations for management or policy will be made by the Forest Service.  Contractor must have demonstrable experience with the protocol Stream Inventory Handbook: level II, Pacific Northwest Region (Region 6), 2002.  

2.	All Items
Survey work shall be performed as outlined in Stream Inventory Handbook: level II, Pacific Northwest Region (Region 6), 2002.  Stream survey reports shall follow at a minimum the example provided in Appendix A; and stream type classification shall follow the “Applied River Morphology” by Dave Rosgen (1996) in Appendix B.  The following forms shall be provided to the contractor: Survey Form, Preliminary Reach Form, Final Reach Form, Channel Unit Form, Special Cases Form, Remarks Form, Aquatic Biota Form, Discharge Form, Wolman Pebble Count Form, stream channel stability evaluation form, and field gear checklist and cheat sheet.

3.	Contract Calendar

No survey work can be done outside these dates unless specifically permitted by the Government.  Final reports (one report for each stream surveyed) shall be delivered to the Government on or before March 1, 2004.

4.	Location and Description
Streams to be surveyed are located within the boundaries of the Mt. St. Helens National Volcanic Monument (MSH), Cowlitz Valley Ranger District (CVRD), and Mt. Adams Ranger District (MTA)of the Gifford PinchotNational Forest.  Payment will be based on the corrected mileage of streams surveyed from the Natural Resource Inventory System (NRIS) Aquatic Inventory (AI) program, database for stream survey data.

Location specifics will be shared with the Contractor during the pre-work session.  Streams to be surveyed are generally 2-3rd order streams.  Physical conditions of the upper reaches of streams to be surveyed may be steep, and in some middle and upper reaches; the terrain may be difficult to negotiate.  Due to recent road damages by flood events, some access roads may require 4-wheel drive or other all-terrain transportation.  Overnight campouts may expedite work on more remote streams which may be one hour or greater in travel time to the nearest town.

The Contractor shall exercise caution for personal safety while conducting surveys.  For safety purposes, field surveys shall be conducted by at least a 2 person crew per stream surveyed.  If the Contractor does not feel the survey can be completed safely, the Contracting Officer or their Representative shall be contacted immediately.  Field conditions would be reviewed by a Government Representative and a decision would be negotiated with the Contractor on how to proceed with field surveys.

5.	PC Requirement
The Contractor is required to have access to a PC equipped with Windows 3.11 or newer in order to complete required data manipulations, to edit raw data, and to generate hard copies of the corrected raw stream inventory data.  Field data recorders shall not be used to gather the basic field data of stream inventory.

Evaluation Factors for award are:  
1. Record of Past Performance, 
2. Organization and experience of staff, including familiarity with the local area.

TESTING REQUIREMENTS: Test rolls will be inspected to ensure compliance with specifications. Test rolls will be held in SSA's printer area for three calendar days to allow for proper acclimatizing. The rolls will then be used on the appropriate machinery to ensure that the paper meets all requirements for surface stability, vapor emissions, print quality maintenance and fusing quality. The core must function properly without shifting of the paper or jamming. More than one non-compliant roll in the test group constitutes failure. If the test rolls pass these requirements, SSA will give "conditional approval of the test rolls. The Government will have an additional 30 days to ensure that the paper has no detrimental effects on the printing equipment. Additional criteria that may be assessed during this period are: (1) the continued use of the paper must not result in the emission of odor-causing compounds such as sulfur compounds, chlorides, rein-based aerosols or organics; 2) any coatings on the paper must not cause fusing failures; 3) the paper must not cause fusing failures due to the inclusion of synthetic resins synthetic sizing agents or plastics; 4) the paper must not create excessive dust. The amount of paper dust generated must not exceed 75-260 micrograms per cubic meter (SSA Health code standard) or cause printer malfunctions and operator interventions; and, 5) paper must not have additives or other conditions that reduce print quality.
