<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with Illinois  officials, requires three (3) firm, fixed-priced, requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennnis (Motschulsky) within the State of Illinois.  The first contract will cover the Chicago area, the second contract will cover Park Ridge, and the third Addison, Summit, and O'Hare. The application is intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees. ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, and London Plane. This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture has declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  This spring APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 6,100 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 48,000 by trunk injection and an estimated 
48,900 trees with an estimated total dbh of 570,000 by soil injection in the Chicago area; 31,457 trees with an estimated total dbh of 238,826 by trunk injection in the Park Ridge area; and 5,566 trees with an estimated total dbh of 37,508 by trunk injection and an estimated 907 trees with an estimated total dbh of 12,450 in the Addison, Summit, and O'Hare areas. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about February 13, 2003, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer 3 weeks thereafter. The effective period of the contract will be from date of award through September 30, 2003.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer. SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED. This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs, and  other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code: 115310.  Size Standard: $5.0 million dollar average annual receipts.  Interested companies may download the RFP off the Internet after February 12, 2003, or within 2 days thereafter, at the following Internet site: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/mpls/contracts/cbd.html  TELEPHONE REQUESTS FOR A COPY OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE HONORED.

<DESC>UPGRADE AND MODERNIZE ENERGY MANAGEMENT CONTROL SYSTEM NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer (RFO) to Upgrade and Modernize the Energy Management Control System. The work for this requirement consists of, but is not limited to the following: Provide all labor, equipment, tools and materials to modernize the site wide Energy Management Control System (EMCS) to be an Apogee compliant Building Automation System (BAS).  The existing system consists of Siemens "System 600" hardware, firmware and software at the field and control console levels.  The job involves upgrade and/or change out of various field and front-end hardware, upgrade of wiring, telecommunication network system interface and coordination, transition of font-end to Apogee (including complete set-up and transfer of all existing system graphics.  Telecommunication system upgrades will be performed by others, as identified within the specifications.	   The work requires careful planning, scheduling and coordination in order to minimize impact to site activities, in order to coordinate activities with telecommunication system upgrades.  All work will be accomplished in occupied and operating facilities.	 Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.  Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.       The order of magnitude for this procurement is $500,000 and $1,000,000, and the effort shall be completed within (365) calendar days after receipt of the notice to proceed.	    This procurement is unrestricted. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 238210 and $12.0 million, respectively.

GovWorks currently processes some 1,200 to 1,500 invoices per month for approximately 500 vendors.  This is a labor and paper intensive environment.  GovWorks' invoice approval process involves the attention and participation of several different entities.  These entities include the vendor, procurement assistants, the COTR, the CO and the Finance department for disbursement of payments.  In order to implement a successful e-invoicing solution, the system must provide 24 hour x 7 day accessibility to all entities involved.  This requirement is being issued by GovWorks under the franchise authority of the Department of the Interior (DOI) in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties shall identify their interest and request a copy of the solicitation package on or before 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, Thursday, February 20, 2003, via email to both Mary.Coleman@mms.gov AND Terrie.Callahan@mms.gov.  This competitive process will be simplified in order to facilitate the acquisition process and prevent undue administrative burden upon the Contractor(s) and the Government.  After review of the solicitation package, you may submit questions and comments in accordance with the following procedures.  All Offerors must submit any questions in electronic format, either by mail or e-mail in Microsoft Word with one (1) printed copy, no later than 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, Thursday, February 27, 2003, via email to both Mary.Coleman@mms.Gov and Terrie.Callahan@mms.gov.  Please be advised that the Government reserves the right to transmit those questions and answers of a common interest to all prospective Offerors.  In order to compete for this acquisition interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement which is due no later than 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, Monday, March 10,  2003.  The Government will review and evaluate the experience and capability of your organization and proposed project team as demonstrated by the information supplied in this submittal.  All Offerors must submit an electronic copy in Microsoft Word plus one (1) original hard copy to the Contracting Officer at the address specified in this notice.  Your Capabilities Statement should provide information detailing: (1) your key personnel and program manager (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the work) with their qualifications and specific experience within the electronic invoicing environment; (2) your organizational experience within the electronic invoicing environment; and (3) specific references (including contract number &  project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with point of contact & telephone number) for previous  related work within the electronic invoicing environment that your key personnel or organization have performed within the last two years.  If you believe the Government may find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your organization to address the problem.  After review of all Capabilities Statements, those offerors deemed "Best Qualified" will be provided additional proposal instructions and contract requirements.   Your Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on  your key persons' skills, abilities and experience within the electronic invoicing environment; your organization's experience and past performance (including number, size, and complexity of similar projects, technical excellence, adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, willingness to partner with the Government in providing robust solutions, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered product and service rendered.)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. 5114-3-0100 is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12.  The solicitation is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 339111.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees.  Award will be made to a small business provided that a minimum of two competitive offers are received from small business concerns; if two or more offers are not received from qualified small businesses, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition from among all responsible business concerns submitting offers.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Midwest Area, National Animal Disease Center, Ames, Iowa, has a requirement/need  for Ventilated Mouse Racks "Brand Name or Equal" to the Tecniplast SealsafeTM  Models as follows:   2L48MAC30CACP,  2L126MAC30CACP, and  BOX110CP04.  Listed are the description of  items and quantities required: CLIN No. 1 - Model 2L48MAC30CACP, Ventilated Mouse Rack, 48 cages, complete with cage body, wire bar lids, reusable covers, filter paper, water bottles and sipper tubes (1 unit); CLIN No. 2 -  Model 2L126MAC30 CACP, ventilated mouse rack, 126 cages, complete with cage body, wire bar lids, reusable covers, filter paper, water bottles and sipper tubes (6 units); and CLIN No. 3 - Model BOX110CP04, Slim Line Equipment Trolley, with supply and exhaust fan units, HEPA filters and prefilters (5 each).     The mouse caging system will be used for a project to characterize different strains of the agents responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in livestock, deer and elk.  This involves the inoculation of special inbred mice.  Because TSEs have extremely long incubation periods it is essential that these mice be housed in stress-free situations so they can live out their normal life span.  Therefore, it is important to have a housing system that requires minimal handling of cages (for water, feed and litter changes) and a structure that avoids unnecessary environmental stimulations (such as vibration or noise) that can cause these mice to undergo convulsive seizures and death.  THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  the Ventilated Mouse Racks must meet or include these minimum requirements: (1) The cage racks shall be either single or double-sided; (2) The whole cage rack must be easy to clean, disinfect and sterilize in an autoclave and be lightweight for easy maneuvering with all electrical components mounted in sealed boxes that will withstand disinfecting procedures; (3) Cages must have the ability to be used in either negative or positive pressure with a bag-out filter option; (4) The ventilated cage racks must be of the recirculating type with air diffusing into the top of the cage, not directly on the animals and all exhaust air must be removed not pushed out from the cage via the cage top and all exhaust air from the cage rack must be filtered; (5) Water bottles must be removable from the outside without cage removal; (6) Supply and exhaust unit must mount on a separate trolley in order to eliminate sound and vibration; noise generated from the cage rack fans can not exceed 50dBA and the air supply fans or associated equipment must not cause vibration that can spread to the animal cage; (7) The maximum external dimensions of any cage rack must be 78 x 35 inches with total height not exceeding 84 inches in order to use normal doorways and elevators;  (8) Animal cages and filter tops must be molded using polysulfone plastic and able to stand frequent autoclaving; (9) Must have a portable electrical cord with appropriate plug for connection to wall electrical outlet; and (10) Must have capability for flexible hook-up to ceiling-top in house exhaust system.  The Ventilated Mouse Racks must come complete with cage body, wire bar lids, reusable covers, filter paper, water bottles and sipper tubes.  DESCRIPTIVE LITERATURE:  Offerors shall submit 2 copies of the Descriptive Literature describing their proposed equipment in enough detail to ascertain whether the equipment meets the criteria listed above.  REJECTION OF PROPOSAL:  Failure to demonstrate compliance will be cause to reject the proposal without further discussions.

In addition, Bruker BioSpin  Corporation manufactures the majority of NMR spectrometer systems in use at other government labs.  Diagnostic data differs in format among NMR manufacturers, making data exchange difficult, if not impossible should Dugway Proving Ground purchase its syst em from another manufacturer.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Supporting evidence must be furnished to demonstrate the ability to comply with th e Government's requirements. If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with sole source negotiation with Bruker BioSpin Corporation.

<DESC>Notice is hereby given of the intent to issue Financial Assistance Solicitation No.DE-PS26-03NT41757-0 entitled, "Ground Breaking Innovative Technology Concepts For Mining."  The Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is seeking white paper applications on behalf of the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Mining Industries of the Future Program, for advanced concepts that span the mining industry and are capable of revolutionizing the industry as a whole or for discrete segments as regards energy intensity (i.e. energy used to achieve a unit output). The objective of this solicitation is to support the stated national interests by providing seed funding for development of "revolutionary" concepts or "unique" approaches that would define the direction for potential future research and development projects that address needs that broadly fall in the domestic mining industry.  These approaches should represent significant departures from existing approaches, not simply incremental improvements. This solicitation seeks "out-of-the-box" thinking; therefore, mature ideas, past the conceptual stage, are not eligible for this program.  Cost sharing is not required because of the fundamental nature of the requested research under this solicitation, but the DOE/NETL will only contribute up to $50,000 per project selected for award. DOE has identified specific mining industry activities where energy efficiency improvements would have the most significant impact.  This solicitation encourages prospective concepts to be developed in the following areas: Area of Interest 1: DE-PS26-03NT41757-1 Energy Efficient Alternatives to Current Technologies in Materials Handling Interests include energy alternatives with regard to energy use per unit of output to current technologies involving the used of equipment or processes to transport ore and waste. Area of Interest 2: DE-PS26-03NT41757-2 Energy Efficient Alternatives to Current Beneficiation and Processing Technologies, Particularly Crushing and Grinding Interests include energy alternatives with regard to energy use per unit of output to current technologies using equipment or processes to crush, grind, concentrate and/or separating the ore from the unwanted material. Area of Interest 3: DE-PS26-03NT41757-3 Mineral Extraction Processes to Reduce Downstream Material Handling and Beneficiation and Processing Requirements; Efficiency Alternatives to Pumping in Mining Applications Interests include energy alternatives to mineral processes using equipment or processes to explore, mine and process ore. Applications offering emissions or waste disposal, remediation or treatment as a primary focus are not eligible for funding under this solicitation.  This limitation does not include applications that target materials recycling or by-product utilization as their primary focus. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), DOE Management and Operating (M&O) contractors and Federal Agencies are prohibited from participating at any level in applications submitted in response to this solicitation.  If an application is received which includes participation by these organizations, it will be rejected without evaluation.

The contractor, using Government furnished servers and contractor owned equipment, is responsible for performing data entry, complex validation, editing, compiling services, and providing, on a production schedule, data bases completely edited for accuracy and available for immediate retrieval without further error checking of any sort.  Statistical data and reported findings are available for query and report generation by the FRA or similar use by the agency, state and local governments, railroad labor and industry, and private groups or citizens.  The principle technique for presenting and retrieving information is the FRA Internet site; this site and the multi-level secure area present the statistics, and individual reports to the public and the FRA. The contractor will also be responsible for the maintenance of both sites, public and secure.  The secure site has many of the features on the FRA Internet site, and access to the secure site content is determined by a user authentication table which the contractor maintains.  This determines what applications the individual user will be able to see and what type of file maintenance operations the user will be able to perform on a number of web-based data collection programs FRA has deployed.  The secure site area will allow access to programs and data dependent on individual user.  The secure site also provides for restricted interactive data entry and validation. The contractor will also be responsible for the automated e-mail notification system that generates e-mails to users based on data file sweeps.  The contractor is responsible for maintaining and physically hosting both sites, providing web site security, and providing enhancements. The current FRA contractor operates the project out of a dedicated facility in Alexandria, VA.  The office space includes a climate-controlled server room which houses several government owned enterprise and mid-range servers which house the production and master (web) databases.  The Office of Safety public site (http://safetydata.fra.dot.gov ) and the secure site are hosted on a dedicated T-1 line.  The contractor also hosts a dedicated email server for the government owned domain which is used for all project related communication.  The contractor is responsible for maintaining all equipment in the room including servers, routers, switches,  power management systems and other devices.  The contractor is also responsible for maintaining the firewalls and for ensuring that virus protection logs are up to date. The contract type has not been determined but it is anticipated to include a 15 month base period, three consecutive one-year option periods, and a fourth option period consisting of 9 months. The solicitation for this proposed contract will be available to interested parties via the internet at www.FEDBIZOPPS.gov.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be available.

(End of Clause)
52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Central Contractor Registration (May. 1999): (a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. (2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either-- (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or (ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). (b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210. (d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract-financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. (e) Contractor EFT arrangements. If the Contractor has identified multiple payment receiving points (i.e., more than one remittance address and/or EFT information set) in the CCR database, and the Contractor has not notified the Government of the payment receiving point applicable to this contract, the Government shall make payment to the first payment receiving point (EFT information set or remittance address as applicable) listed in the CCR database. (f) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for-- (i) Making a correct payment; (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and-- (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. (g) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. (h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. (i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. (j) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.

<CONTACT>Kris Trump 301-227-5756 Kris Trump, 301-227-5756/Contracting Officer:  Laura Rider, 301-227-5821
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to procure, through Other than Full and Open Competition, engineering, technical, and drafting support to incorporate an oil-cooled bellows seal design on York International HFC-236fa air conditioning systems.  The redesign of the shaft seal will prevent current shaft seal leakage.  Current seals have revealed chipping, spalling, and blistering of the carbon element under the current design.  Replacing the shaft seal with an oil-cooled bellows type shaft seal will prevent these problems and provide a better seal.  The Contractor shall incorporate the Bellows Type Shaft Seals per John Crane Drawings, 819416N2, 818805N2, and 818849N2 into the Compressor Drawings, the Conversion Drawings, the Final Configuration Drawings, the Installation Instructions, the Technical Manual and the Control Software.  This task appl ies to York Compressors: 364-48756-000, 364,48511-002, 364-48782-000, 364-50107-000, 364-48921-000, 364-48921-000, 364-48662-000, 364-49792-000, 364-48662-000, 364-48833-000.  The only design changes required to incorporate the Bellows Type Shaft Seals are: (1) the addition of a tube in the oil system downstream of the oil cooler to provide oil injection at the face of the shaft seal (2) the addition of a solenoid valve in the compressor vent tube that is closed upon unit start-up and opens after a predetermined period of time following start-up to control sump pressure (3) the incorporation of a new shaft seal relief valve design or the replacement of the existing shaft seal relief valve with a fixed orifice to maintain the shaft seal cavity at the desired pressure (4) the incorporation of a tapered land thrust collar and radial groove thrust bearing on 363-ton compressors and  (5) modification of the machining tolerances for the thrust bearings, pinion gear bearings and rotor support to provide additional clearance for thermal expansion for all HFC-236fa applications.  Modifications incorporated to utilize the bellows seal design will need to meet shock, vibration and EMI military requirements.  Contractor shall prepare shock and vibration test extension requests to obtain shock qualification approval per MIL-S-901D and vibration qualification approval per MIL-STD-167-1.  Contractor shall prepare Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) extension requests to obtain EMI qualification approval per MIL-STD-461, Part 5.  Contractor shall be available for informal and formal conferences with NSWCCD and NAVSEA technical personnel to be held as required throughout performance, to discuss the direction, progress and/or problems which occur during each task assign ment.  The formal conferences will be held at the contractors facility.  Meetings will be held quarterly for the three-year period.    NSWCCD intends to procure the three year base contract requirements, through Other than Full and Open Competition, with York International Corporation, York, Pennsylvania.  York International Corporation is the sole manufacturer of the required services and supplies and therefore maintains all relative proprietary data and the ability to utilize it and therefore York International is the only known source that is capable of providing the engineering, technical, and drafting support to incorporate an oil-cooled bellows seal design on a HFC-236fa AC systems.  York International also has been the sole manufacture of CFC-114 AC plants, HFC-236fa AC plants currently installed the Fleet. Consequently, the FAR cite supporting Other than Full and Open  Competition is FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (NSWCDD CSS), Panama City, Florida, 32407-7001 intends to award a Purchase Order to PFU Systems, c/o EMA, 5959 Baker Road, Suite 440, Minnetonka, MN. 55345-5956, on a sole source basis, for 8 each Fuel Management Computers, part number XCSS-7-11-C. These computers are components of the LHA 5 IFFCS System. The IFFCS System is an existing, Fleet fielded, shock-qualified system. As part of the IFFCS System, these computers have been tested and meet all shock requirements. This acquisition is not suitable for full and open competition because no other units can be used without successfully passing the required shock, vibration and temperature testing necessary to qualify the system for use aboard U.S. Navy Vessels. It is estimated that re-qualifying the entire IFFCS System would cost the U.S. Navy hundreds o f thousands of dollars and would take several months to complete, thus significantly delaying delivery to the fleet. Any source interested in qualifying other units for future acquisitions should contact Mr. Michael Conn, CSS, Code R52 Panama City, FL. 32407 (850) 235-5750.  NAICS Code 334119 applies.  SBA Size standard is 1000 employees.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (NOTSD) requires Virginia Class Submarine (VSSN) development, fabrication and testing of the Virginia Class submarine Emergency Diesel Generator Control Panel (DGCP) Front Panel Simulator (FPS) and logistics support.  The successfully tested and completed trainer shall be delivered to NAVSUBSCOL, New London, CT.  The primary use of this trainer will be to teach operation, casualty and degraded modes, maintenance, engine troubleshooting and fault isolation skills.  The diesel engine generator set simulation software will be used to simulate a diesel operational engine (Caterpillar 3512B).  The student station will receive simulated inputs as if a real engine were connected.  The student station configuration will include the diesel generator control panel, the diesel local control panel, the laptop computer system and a two-dimensional photo engraved engine generator mockup.  The DLCP will have the physical appearance of the tactical DLCP and will simulate or stimulate the operations of the tactical DLCP.  Attached to the top of the DLCP will be the engine vision interface module.  This module will link data to the DGCP.  Other modules linking to the DLCP are the electronic control modules, the versatile control module and the integrated temperature sensor module.  The DLCP will provide necessary data to the laptop computer system.  This data will enable correct diagnostic processing with the CAT Electronic Technician (ET) Tool.  The interface between the Caterpillar ET Tool and the DLCP is proprietary and the government does not own the documentation to support it.  There will be no government furnished equipment or government furnished information in the production of this system.  PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS WHO RESPONDED TO THE "SOURCES SOUGHT" ANNOUNCEMENT DATED 24 OCT 2002 DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND UNLESS THE CONTRACT SPECIALIST DOES NOT HAVE YOUR CURRENT EMAIL ADDRESS.

<DESC>Democratic Development and Citizen Participation Project (DDCP) RFP Pre-Solicitation Notice Description:  The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement the program described below.  The DDCP has been a joint effort between the Bolivian and U.S. governments since 1995.  That year, USAID/Bolivia (USAID/B) authorized an eight year DDCP project to support democratic development in Bolivia including implementation of the 1994 Popular Participation Law (PPL).  The PPL and 1995 Constitutional Reforms created for the first time in Bolivia a democratic political environment which not only enabled, but required citizens to participate fully in the decisions affecting their lives.  The DDCP project is now at a point where further work is needed to strengthen and sustain the work accomplished over the past eight years. Emphasis will be on the replication of lessons learned thus far and further application of an already existing participatory municipal planning model and a parallel gender model.  The new, five-year DDCP project's purpose is to: (a) strengthen citizen participation in municipal and national government; and (b) develop the ability of municipal governments, national and departmental electoral institutions and the National Congress to respond effectively to the demands resulting from increased and directed citizen participation.  The contractor will continue to expand the participatory municipal planning in more urban areas in Bolivia.  To include gender-sensitive planning model, using departmental associations and groups of associations known as mancomunidades, as well as, Government of Bolivia (GOB) entities, non-governmental organizations, and other interested partners.  The contractor will maintain and expand the DDCP Popular Participation Grant Fund, for continued support to Bolivia's Federation of Municipalities (FAM) and other associations involved in the municipal decentralization process.  The contractor will work with indigenous groups to address issues related to the current land tenure laws with the laws of decentralization and popular participation.  The contractor will develop pilot activities to facilitate the participation of micro-enterprises and other municipal financing and revenue generation strategies.  This will include technical assistance to FAM and other departmental associations and work with the GOB to improve local government financing and to provide institutional, financial and advisory support in an attempt to achieve sustainability. The contractor will work with the GOB and with other donor activities to promote the improvement of local revenue collections, and encourage the use of innovative forms of financing to engage the private sector.  The contractor will implement one or more pilot activities to apply the participatory planning model to a regional infrastructure or service at an inter-governmental level. The contractor will work closely with other projects in the democracy sector such as the legislative strengthening project, to share information regarding the legislator's activities to date and to identify issues/problems where local officials may require assistance.  The contractor will also work closely with other USAID/B Strategic Objective Teams (SOTs) such as the Alternative Development team to pursue the objectives of the DDCP.  One Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract will be awarded for implementation of these activities.  Implementation will occur over a five year period.  USAID/B is planning to hold a Pre-Proposal conference late March.  Further information about exact location and time will forthcoming.  USAID/B encourages qualified offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a February 24, 2003.  Proposal due date will be April 24, 2003.  Please correct Phone and Fax number for Maria Elena Burgos to read:  Phone 591-2-2786445, Fax 591-2-2785689.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-BAA-03-06-IFKA
<CONTACT>IFKA ContractingOfficer, Contracting Officer, Phone 315/330-4767, Email IFKA@rl.af.mil
<DESC>Technical POC:  Capt Mark Murray, Program Manager, (315) 330-7755, email: Mark.Murray@rl.af.mil or Julie Brichacek, (315) 330-4995, email: Julie.Brichacek@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: IFKA, Contracting Officer, email: AFRL.IFKA@rl.af.mil.  The Information Directorate, Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) Program Office of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers for the design and development of information management prototypes that securely disseminate and persist information as defined in the "JBI Mercury Capabilities Guidelines."  The goal of the project is to take the initial steps in developing an information interoperability infrastructure to connect disparate software applications or "clients;" and facilitate information sharing between clients for the creation of a system of systems to enable decision makers to obtain the "right" information, at the "right" time, and in the "right" format.  For the purposes of this effort, contractors will be required to address the following capabilities: JBI Common Application Programming Interface (API) (www.infospherics.org/api/); JBI Information Object Model; Content-based Publish, Subscribe and Query information dissemination services; Access Control based on (1) the role of the client, (2) the requested operation (i.e. publish/subscribe/ query) and (3) the information object type; Account Management mechanisms; Identification and Authentication (I&A) mechanism; and Persistence Management of information objects and their corresponding metadata.  The JBI Mercury team has further defined the preceding capabilities in a document titled "Mercury Capabilities Guidelines."  Offerors can obtain copies of the Mercury Capabilities Guidelines by downloading the document from www.rl.af.mil/programs/jbi/mercury.cfm or requesting the document, in an electronic format, from the JBI program office at jbi@rl.af.mil.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit to the addressee below, eight (8) copies of an eight (8) to twelve (12) page white paper on their proposed solution.  The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Name of Company, Title, Period of Performance and Milestones, Cost of Task; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Approach.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Complete proposal instructions will be contained in a letter accepting your white paper and requesting a proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract.  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission.  Responses to this BAA must be addressed to: AFRL/IFSE, Attn: Julie Brichacek, 525 Brooks Rd, Bldg 3, Rome, NY 13441-4515 and must reference BAA 03-06-IFKA.  The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  White papers/proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other white papers or proposals submitted under this BAA. The evaluation of white papers/proposals will be performed using the following criteria in descending order of importance:  (1) Technical Merits, Innovative Approach/Techniques, Technical Plan and Technical Risk of the white paper/proposal in addressing Mercury project capabilities; (2) The Reasonableness and Realism of the proposed costs and fees, if any; (3) The Reasonableness, Realism and Risks of the proposed schedule; and (4) The Capability to Staff and Complete the proposed work.  Offerors? white papers/proposals should place technical emphasis on project capabilities in the following order of importance: (1) Information Dissemination [Content-based Publish, Subscribe, and Query]; (2) Information Assurance [Assess Control, Account Management, and Identification and Authentication]; and (3) Persistence Management [Information Object Repository and Metadata Repository].  Additionally, offerors shall address and implement the JBI Common API and the JBI Information Object Model in their proposed solution; otherwise, the white paper/proposal shall be considered unacceptable.   No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. To maximize the possibility of award it is recommended that white papers be received after 20 Feb 2003, but before close of business 10 Mar 2003.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available. This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 2005.  Principle funding for proposals selected from this announcement will begin in FY03 with multiple awards structured with a Phase I (preliminary design) portion not normally exceeding six (6) months at an estimated $500K,  and an option for the Phase II (critical design and development) portion of approximately  twelve (12) months duration for an estimated $1.5M.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  Total funding for the BAA is $4.8M.  The Government may use the services of MITRE Corporation (www.mitre.org) in an advisory role for the technical evaluation of white papers and/or proposals.  The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government.  Representatives of the foregoing firm who review the white papers and/or proposals will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals.  If the offeror desires the cited firm be excluded from access to information contained in its white paper and/or proposal, the offeror must so indicate in a letter of transmittal accompanying the document.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point at AFRL.IFKA@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding.  Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer at AFRL.IFKA@rl.af.mil.  The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Pre-solicitation notice for Solicitation No. 03SP101524 is currently available.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 235990 and the size standard is $12 million. This requirement is not set-aside for small businesses and is issued pursuant to the Small Business Competiveness Demonstration Program.  The estimated price range of the work is $500,000 to $1,000,000.   The work to be performed under this solicitation consists of installing tensioned rock bolts into the left abutment in the upper, mid, and lower block areas for stabilization.  The work includes drilling holes a minimum of 4 inches in diameter and varying in length from 20 to 60 feet; grouting and re-drilling each drill hole; furnishing and installing rock bolts; grouting rock bolts through the anchor length, tensioning, then grouting the rest of the length; installing concrete bearing pads and/or steel bearing plates required for tensioning.  Scaling of the rock slope before rock bolting begins and excavating and disposing loose material from the upper portion of the left abutment is also required.  Deadwood Dam is located in a remote area about 55 air miles (90 road miles) northeast of Boise, Idaho.   The solicitation will be available on CD-ROM in Adobe Acrobat format and will be available on or about March 3, 2003 (this is an estimated date).  To obtain a copy of the CD and be included on the planholder list, interested bidders must register on our website at www.pn.usbr.gov/contracts/construction.  Visit the website to obtain further instructions about registering.  If you don't provide your DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System) and TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number) on the electronic registration form, we will not send the solicitation to you.  If you attended the site visit in September 2002, and have already registered to receive the solicitation on our website, you do not need to register again.  Telephone requests for the solicitation won't be accepted.   There is no charge for the first copy of the CD and $15 for each additional copy requested.  We reserve the right to issue the solicitation on paper if it becomes necessary.   The Office of Management and Budget has instructed all federal agencies to adopt use of the Central Contactor Registration system as a single, government-wide system for storing contractor procurement and payment information.   By October 1, 2003, a vendor must be registered in the CCR in order to receive contracts and purchase orders from most federal agencies, including the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.  CCR is a self-service database.  Vendors register themselves and maintain their own information through the CCR web site. If not already registered, we encourage entities interested in USBR business to register in the system now, to avoid any disruption or loss of awards after the revised regulation takes effect.  To register or learn more about the CCR, go to:  www.ccr.gov/vendor.cfm.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by this agency.

CONTRACT INFORMATION: BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT soliciting information and descriptions (White Papers), not to exceed five pages per project, of ongoing technical or project activity addressing areas of interest described in this announcement.  The intent of this announcement is to identify ongoing efforts currently funded by state and/or local governments, academic institutions, OTHER FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, or the private sector intended to improve the security or reduce the vulnerability of transportation services to accidental or intentional disruption. The scope of transportation involved includes physical infrastructure and vehicles associated with pipelines, rail, ports and waterways, civil aviation, mass transit, highways, and especially combinations of these modes and the interfaces between and among them, as well as the information infrastructure associated with their operation and control.  The aim of this activity is to take necessary steps to identify promising technologies and concepts and to promote their expeditious implementation.

****This announcement is hereby modified to expand the areas of innovative technologies, methods and concepts to include activities which predict and detect security threats in multi-modal transportation services and operations.  Examples of such activities include: in-flight aviation threats, service disruptions to urban and intercity rail and mass transit stations and operations, service disruptions to intermodal operations, service disruptions to marine operations and ports, and surveillance of transportation systems through land and space-based sensing, communications and control technologies.****

Specific areas of interest include but are not limited to the following: (1) risk and vulnerability assessment - new and innovative analytical techniques which might be applied to detecting potential hazards or weaknesses in the configuration of transportation;   (2) planning for transportation related contingencies - taking steps in advance which might minimize the negative effects of disruptions to transportation services; (3) innovative approaches to threat detection and evaluation - use of innovative technologies or approaches to determine whether malicious disruptions to specific transportation functions or services are likely, as well as other screening technologies for users or passengers; (4) reduction of vulnerabilities from critical infrastructure interdependencies - identification of interactions or interdependencies between/among transportation and other sectors and development of techniques to minimize negative aspects of disruptions to either; (5) innovative use of "smart technologies" to establish/assure the integrity of transportation physical infrastructure - use of micro/nano sensors  to detect damage to transportation structures, and possibly repair damage without further intervention (6) approaches to improving the robustness of the information infrastructure responsible for transportation operational controls - development of techniques to reduce the vulnerability of transportation controls to use or misdirect

Question & Answers
1.  Are you able to tell what brand you are currently using?  Answer:  The brands are
listed above.
2. What prices you last paid and to whom.  Answer:  We cannot give out unit prices
unless you go through FOIA.  Who was the contractor who had it last year? 
Answer:  Harris Pharmacy.

Answer:   It will be awarded item-by-item basis.  See the FAR Reference at 52.214-2
within the solicitation.
4. Can we bid the brand name you list and a lower priced alternative?  Answer:  
You may bid on the brand name and provide an alternative quote in accordance
with FAR.52.212-1.
5.  Are you considering a generic as alternative if a substantial saving, or really
prefer brand name?  Answer:  We have been receiving the name brands listed;
however, the size of the item is what the customer is mostly concerned about.
6. There were numerous clauses, i.e. about 12 of them, listed below, do all those
need to be printed out and sent with bid? Answer: If not which clauses must be
printed and sent?  Answer:  No, not all the clauses have to be printed out, just 
FAR 52.212-3, which needs to be filled in and sent with your quote.

bid 2 oz?  Answer:  yes.
12. Are we allowed to bid any imported items, i.e. from Canada, or does the Buy

definition of the Buyer American Act. 
13.  Shoe Shine Kit - Is this a special military product or the normal retail products?
Answer: Both military and a retail product.

Pert or Head & Shoulders are acceptable; however, the size bottle is critical not to
go over the 15-oz.
15. Are you looking for a bid on chapstick or blistex?  
Answer:  Looking for Chapstick.

<DESC>NA Information on carbon dioxide compressors is sought to determine suitability for testing by the U.S. Army for use in future Environmental Control Units (ECUs).  The U.S. Army requires advanced heating and cooling technology for a variety of equipment appli cations. One of these is the military family of Environmental Control Units (ECUs). High performance systems with reduced logistics support requirements and environmentally responsible working fluids are desired. Of specific interest is implementing techno logy for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The transcritical carbon dioxide cycle offers these possibilities. The U.S. Army CECOM RDE Center, Army Power Division, is applying for approval from the Department of Defense to initiate the Foreign Comp arative Test Program for Transcritical CO2 Cooling and Heating Technology Compressor Evaluations in Fiscal Year 2004. The Army intends to identify the 4 most promising foreign (non-U.S.) compressor models and procure 2 of each for testing and evaluation.

<SUBJECT>A--System Development and Demonstration for the XM307
<SOLNBR>DAAE30-03-R-0409
<RESPDATE>022803
<CONTACT>Kelly A. Gerould, Contract Specialist, (973) 724-4220
<DESC>The Product Manager for Crew Served Weapons is seeking sources for the execution of the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase of the XM307, Objective Crew Served Machine Gun.  The Government is currently conducting an Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  The XM307 is the next generation infantry crew served weapon that will replace selected MK19 and M2 machine guns for Objective Force Warrior (OFW) equipped infantry units and is the defensive armament system for the Future Combat Systems (FCS).  The SDD phase is planned beginning in 4QFY03, followed by a 2 year Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) starting in FY08.  The SDD phase will be divided into 2 two-year sub phases, System Integration (SI) and System Demonstration (SD).  The Product Manager foresees complex issues of integrating designs and requirements of the weapon system, ammunition, fire control, supportability and integration with OFW and FCS during development.  System Description: The XM307 consists of a lightweight low recoil weapon (ground or vehicle mountable), a ground mount and a ruggedized compact, single, integrated full solution day/night target acquisition/fire control (TA/FC) system capable of all weather operations.  A family of cartridges for the weapon will be developed including high explosive air bursting (HEAB) munition that will have a settable fuze, an armor piercing (AP) cartridge, a target practice (TP) cartridge, a target practice-spotter (TP-S) cartridge with a settable fuze and indicates actual burst location and a blank cartridge for force on force training.  The TA/FC will have a direct view powered optic mode, thermal sighting mode and a television/camera mode all with automatic, ballistically adjusted reticles.  It will include a laser range finder; a compass, cant and inclinometer; an environmental sensor suite; a combat identification module and an infrared aiming light; laser illuminator pointer and embedded training.  The TA/FC will automatically program the HEAB or TP-S fuzes.  It will contain a full ballistic algorithm to facilitate accurate placement of the airburst munition on target incorporating data from environment and attitude sensors.  The TA/FC will be controlled from weapon mounted switches to command the laser rangefinder and allow manual manipulation of the airburst range.  The system will be fully integrated with the OFW and FCS.  The weapon portion of the system must be able to be re-configured to fire .50 caliber ammunition and maintain maximum commonality of its component parts when in the .50 caliber configuration.  Key Performance Parameters (in a fielded system) include:  Weight: The XM307 system will weigh no more than 75 pounds when fully loaded with 50 HEAB rounds, the TA/FC, tripod and power supply.  Range/Lethality The system will have capability out to a range of 2,000 meters and must provide a probability of incapacitation P(i) of not less than 0.25 at 500 meters with a three round burst against personnel targets in defilade.  The system must provide a fractional casualty F(c) of not less than 0.25 at 1000 meters with 3 three round bursts against a squad-sized target.  The system must provide a mobility/fire power kill K(m/f) of not less than 0.5 at 1000 meters against a vehicle target using up to 12 rounds.  Reliability: The system should be rugged enough to withstand military use, including airborne and shipboard operations without degredation of the performance.  The contractor must have working developmental prototypes or test beds to demonstrate both the XM307 and the .50 caliber variant.  The offeror must conduct testing to verify models and designs. This testing would include but is not limited to warhead arena testing, aeroballistic testing, laser testing (integration of lasers), integrated TA/FC model testing, HEAB reliability (both function and range), weapon recoil mitigation, system characterization and weapon load testing.  The contractor must develop a virtual trainer with the capabilities to replicate the functions of the TA/FC with the bursting munitions in firing scenarios to allow cost effective training of troops.  The virtual trainer will be used during user evaluations and engineering.  Current Government simulators can be modified to meet this requirement.  The SI deliverable will be five XM307 prototype systems for FCS integration in 4QFY05.  A Critical Design Review and an In-Process Review will be conducted prior to entering the SD phase.  The SD deliverables will be 12+50 production representative systems and ammunition in 4QFY06: 12 systems for Government testing and 50 systems for FCS integration.  These hardware deliverables include HEAB and AP ammunition, TP, TP-S and blank cartridges.  The Government is interested only in those contractors who have specific knowledge with this subject matter and have experience to conduct a successful SDD phase within the 48-50 month period and can conduct a successful LRIP phase by meeting the U.S. Army's minimum technical requirements listed in the Key Performance Parameters.  In response to this survey, contractors should provide specific knowledge, abilities (including drawings and results of their working prototypes) and past efforts that will give the Government the required confidence that the contractor is capable of executing a successful SDD program. Contractors considering a teaming arrangement with other companies should provide notice to that effect as well as individual team member specific knowledge, abilities and past efforts.  Interested contractors and those of their team members should submit their qualifications for executing this phase of the program by Feb. 28, 2003 to: Commander, US Army TACOM-ARDEC, Acquisition Center, AMSTA-AQ-APD, Bldg. 10, ATTN: Kelly Gerould, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.  E-mail: kgerould@pica.army.mil.  Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualification: (1)Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development efforts; (2)Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist, engineers and technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project officer; (3) Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration; (4) A statement regarding industry security clearance.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (not a pre-solicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5) issued by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute of Health (NIH),  seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Tissue Processing and Distribution Center (TC) for a new five-year multi-center research program, the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC). The LTRC will be a network of centers cooperating to harvest and process lung tissue specimen with corresponding clinical data for use in scientific studies of the pathogenesis of lung diseases, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. The goal of the LTRC is to enable better management of lung diseases by increasing understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases through molecular histopathological studies of human lung tissues with and without disease. The LTRC, through the TC will facilitate histopathological research of pulmonary diseases by preparing and distributing collections of tissue specimens obtained at surgery to researchers. The LTRC will be comprised of Clinical Centers (CCs), the TC, a Radiology Center (RC), and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). The TC will:  prepare protocols for specimen procurement, processing, transport, storage, and distribution;  train CC personnel regarding specimen handling, processing, and shipping to the TC; conduct site visits to assure that LTRC protocol procedures are followed; perform diagnostic histopathological analysis of lung tissues; obtain relevant quantitative measures of disease presence or severity (e.g., mean chord length) in lung tissue specimens; perform quality control/quality assurance tests and report results to the DCC; store specimens received; perform diagnostic, light-microscopic, histopathological analyses of CC lung tissues by a board-certified pathologist; and prepare and distribute specimens and collections of specimens to researchers. The Principal Investigator of the TC will participate fully in the activities of the Steering Committee to: identify lung conditions other than COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for which lung tissues are needed for research and may be available from External Tissue Contributors (ETCs); define inclusion/exclusion criteria for auxiliary groups of donor subjects appropriate for research of these conditions; set target numbers of donor subjects for each group, determine what tissues are to be accepted (e.g., surgical specimens, transbronchial biopsies), and determine what data should be extracted from the donor subjects? medical records in each of these groups; identify any problems with existing LTRC procedures and any difficulties that may interfere with LTRC objectives; devise strategies to improve procedures and overcome difficulties, and submit recommended changes in policies and protocols to the Scientific Advisory Committee for evaluation.   The TC will maintain an inventory of specimens and specimen collections available for distribution to investigators; transport specimens and specimen collections to LTRC investigators and external researchers as directed by the DCC and in accordance with the LTRC Protocol Manual; work with other LTRC investigators to prepare reports and manuscripts for publication. ******This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.

<SUBJECT>JTRS-M Industry day #3 Notice
<DESC>Commerce Business Daily Notice of Advisory Multi-Step Process and Industry Day for Joint Tactical Radio System - Maritime/Fixed Site (JTRS-M/F) Cluster 3 POC:  Mark Lopez, SPAWAR 02-32, Contracting Officer, (e-mail address: mark.lopez@navy.mil or lopezm@spawar.navy.mil); commercial telephone (619) 524-7168. DESCRIPTION:   The objective of the Joint Tactical Radio System-Maritime/Fixed Site (JTRS-M/F) Cluster 3 program is to develop a Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) specifically for maritime and fixed site communication requirements. The purpose of the development effort is to create the next generation Maritime and Fixed Site Communication system which shall provide growth capabilities through an open system architecture that enables technology insertion through evolutionary acquisition or preplanned product improvements (P3I). JTRS-M/F shall be a multi-mode, multi-band, software definable radio system. This will result in increased operational flexibility, enhanced interoperability and reduced life cycle cost. JTRS-M/F will be capable of transmitting voice, video, and data while operating in frequency bands from 2 MHz to 2000 MHz. In order to facilitate an orderly and cost-effective migration from legacy systems, the new JTRS-M/F shall maintain backward compatibility with selected legacy systems and provide a seamless technological transition path to support the next generation radio room. The JTRS-M/F will be defined as a complete end-to-end communications system with a combination of hardware elements, supporting software infrastructure, and government furnished waveform applications. This system will include all RF distribution and control equipment to support voice, video, and data communications. The JTRS Program is a series of related but independent joint acquisitions. The Army is the Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) for the joint activities executed by the JTRS Joint Program Office (JPO).  The JPO is responsible for defining, developing, validating, and maintaining the Software Communication Architecture (SCA) and acquiring software waveform applications. The JTRS-M/F (Cluster 3) Program Manager (Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, PMW 179) is responsible for developing JTRS-M/F hardware (with a SCA-compliant operating environment) and porting waveforms obtained from the JTRS JPO waveform repository to field the JTRS-M/F as a final consolidated product in support of the Fleet and other service fixed sites. The key goals of the system are to ensure maximum scalability, modularity, and extensibility across all ship classes and fixed site platforms. The anticipated release date for the official JTRS-M/F Cluster 3Request for Proposal (RFP) is in the summer 2003 timeframe with contract award anticipated 1th Qtr calendar year 2004.  It is estimated that the successful offerors will have approximately thirty (30) months from contract award to provide Engineering Developmental Models (EDM) for testing. This CBD announcement is to invite Prime System Level potential offerors to submit information that allows the government to evaluate and advise the respondents about their potential to be viable competitors IAW FAR 15.202 (i.e. Advisory Multi-Step Process).  The government will not evaluate submitted information if it only concerns a part of the JTRS-M/F System, e.g. only the radio.  Submittals must address the entire JTRS/MF System as detailed in the attached specification.  Offerors shall present their submission to the government team at a Cluster 3 Industry Day 11-13 March 2003 to be held in San Diego at the Booz, Allen, and Hamilton offices located at:1615 Murray Canyon Rd Suite 220 San Diego, California 92108 Phone - (619) 725-6500 Advisory Multi-Step Process (FAR 15.202):  Prime System Level potential offerors are invited to provide to the government a forty  (40) page limit (total) electronic response to this part of the CBD announcement in the following categories: 1) Current JTRS-M/F related products relevant to this solicitation - Provide information on the availability of your current related products and the extent of any modifications required to meet the requirements as outlined in the draft specification relevant to the forthcoming solicitation.  Include your proposed system architecture with detailed block diagrams. 2) Baseline Requirements - Demonstrate your ability via a technical approach or documented past experience to provide the Cluster 3 capabilities (identified in the Specification attached) using either non-developmental or developmental products and discuss the risk to accomplish the baseline requirements and how these risks will be overcome.  Discuss what technical or cost tradeoffs can be made to meet baseline requirements. 3) Legacy equipment - Provide information on how the proposed capabilities will meet or exceed existing legacy equipment including a simplified plan on how the vendor would verify this requirement. 4) Baseband Interface Connectivity - Provide a technical analysis using either current or developed technology demonstrating an ability to interface with current and future Baseband equipment  - address the technical and operational viability of implementing the conceptual Legacy Interface Unit (LIU). 5) RF Interfaces - Address approach to satisfy the automated RF switching requirement (i.e. JTRS-M/F Cluster 3 Objective - Any Radio RF channel to applicable RF Distribution System components).  Proposed design shall include block diagrams and affordability of proposed solution.  Discuss what technical or cost tradeoffs can or must be made to satisfy this objective. Additional information desired (and not subject to page limit) by the government for informational purposes is: 6) Cluster 3 Schedule - Provide an executive type schedule that portrays the efforts planned in order to deliver the Cluster 3.  Identify the level of schedule risk associated with this schedule. 7) ROM cost of Delivered baseline Cluster 3 system - Provide an estimated production price of a Cluster 3 system for DDG-51 class ship with a breakdown of the major equipment/cost areas. 8) Specification Clarification- Address the major clarifications and/or deficiencies associated with the High Level System Specification and associated appendices / annexes. 9)  Additional Information required - Provide detailed non-proprietary questions addressing additional information required of the Government. 10) Address the portability issues and constraints associated with integrating JPO waveforms into the Cluster 3 System.

<SUBJECT>15 -- UMFOT System
<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Support/Commercial Derivative Aircraft Program Office is planning the acquisition of an Undergraduate Military Flight Officer Training (UMFOT) System (T-39 replacement with radar, ground based training system, and curriculum) and life cycle support, with contract award planned in fiscal year 2004.  NAVAIR is in the process of conducting market research to identify commercial products that are capable of meeting the UMFOT training objectives.  Research is specifically being held in the area of in-flight radar simulation.  Information concerning the proposed procurement, to include training objectives, mission profiles, and existing course curriculum, can be found at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/ under N00019-PMA273TXX.  NAVAIR is interested in observing demonstrations of in-flight simulated radar capabilities in order to ascertain the level of sophistication and degree of development in this field, as well as the feasibility and limitations of using this technology as an alternative to actual radar systems.  The demonstrations should show how the proposed airborne radar simulation capability can satisfy typical UMFO training requirements for air-to-ground and air-to-air radar tactical/navigation missions, with emphasis on requirements for visual correlation and the ability to account for environmental effects.  The demonstrations shall be performed at Naval Air Station, Pensacola, FL, must be conducted within thirty days from date of this announcement, and should take no longer than three hours.  The Government desires to use military aircraft stationed at the Naval Air Station for conduct this demonstration.  Therefore, when requesting an appointment for a demonstration, contractor's should detail what modifications may be needed to existing aircraft to accommodate the demonstration.  If it is not practical to use Govt. aircraft, then use of contractor aircraft is acceptable, with the understanding that the contractor should not construe this as an opportunity to provide a flight demonstration of specific aircraft. This invitation to participate in the demonstration is voluntary and does not constitute an invitation for bid or a request for proposal.  The purpose of these demonstrations is to conduct market research only, and should not be interpreted as a specific intent to purchase any of these systems nor to include a requirement for this type of system in any resulting request for proposal.  The Government will not reimburse contractors for any costs associated with the demonstrations, and is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with this event.  Point of Contact for information and establishing appointments is Joan Devlin, Contract Specialist, 301-757-8964 (voice), 301-757-9046 (fax), devlinjc@navair.navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Pilot for Retrospective Metadata Tagging
<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK 

Pilot for Retrospective Metadata Tagging

1. Purpose:  

The purpose of this SOW is twofold:  the Government desires to understand what the commercial-off the-shelf (COTS) landscape looks like for the problem domain described below and to conduct several proof of concept explorations identified from that landscape.  The Government seeks to identify potential pilot approaches and techniques available from commercial industry to perform markup and/or indexing of heterogeneous stores using metadata to improve accessibility, relevance (precision + recall) to the community?s legacy data. 

The proposed solutions shall be based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and include the identification of data elements and objects with the goal of improving access through improved content marking or advanced indexing techniques.  

The information gathered from this pilot will be applied to various heterogeneous data stores located throughout a wide community.   The proposed approach shall be based on XML and it must be based on a commercially available capability. The end state of this pilot is to identify a scalable methodology that ultimately demonstrates relevancy, the value of using the Intelligence Community defined metadata when data is searched and/or accessed in an integrated manner.   This pilot study is a three (3) month level-of-effort.

2. Scope And Objectives

The scope of the task includes the following key objectives:

&#61623; Provide a proven and cost effective methodology for retrospectively applying XML metadata tagging and/or indexing a suite of heterogeneous, legacy data stores to include, but not limited to, unstructured and semi-structured data in multiple formats (.doc, html, etc.) and textual fields in structured databases.  
&#61623; More specifically the Intelligence Community?s Markup Language (ICML) should be applied to tag unstructured and semi-structured data found in legacy text reports.  
&#61623; Where applicable, elements of ICML should be used to facilitate searches and/or access across text fields in databases.  A searchable index would point to relevant occurrences within the existing legacy databases, for example.

&#61623; Provide a pilot demonstration of the proposed technology approach and demonstrate how the proposed approach satisfies the above requirements.  The demonstration should illustrate how the specific tools used either achieve the tagging of legacy data and/or return (via an indexed full search) all instances of that information in the legacy data.  As an example, a search against a specific Basic Encyclopedia number/facility/person should return pointers to the full content in unstructured, semi structured and structured data sources published within a certain time period (metadata) that discusses that BE number/facility.

3. Background:  

Currently, many of the needed data sources are held in ?stove-pipe? systems that do not allow easy fusion of information across multiple sources.  Inability to seamlessly access the ?right? data from multiple sources makes many user tasks either impossible or difficult to accomplish in the time required. 

Metadata is ?data about the data?. The Intelligence Community would like to leverage metadata to facilitate the retrieval of information from automated systems in order to increase the relevance (precision + recall) of the data returned.  For the purposes of this pilot, metadata includes standardized information about security classification, the producer and subject content among many other elements of interest.  Metadata has the potential to describe an entire document, a field in a database, or a single word as needed.  By applying standardized metadata to multiple systems, the task of automating access to those systems is greatly simplified.  Metadata tagging using the Extensible Markup Language (XML) is presently the leading technology currently available to address this situation and has been selected by the community to address.  The Intelligence Community has developed several documents on its markup language  that will be made available.

The sharing of data and information is a mission and business essential capability within the Intelligence Community (IC).  The IC System for Information Sharing (ICSIS) architecture defines the underlying framework that facilitates data and information sharing.  To fully realize ICSIS precepts, the use of metadata is critical to enabling an agile environment where data and information is accessed and exchanged efficiently across the IC.  It is the intent of the IC to use IC standardized metadata tagging and metadata markup (Intelligence Community Markup Language?ICML) when exchanging or sharing data within the IC.  To enhance data sharing and to facilitate metadata queries, the IC metadata repository is used to register all metadata and metadata markup standards created or used by the IC and will serve as the baseline for the IC Metadata Standard for Products (ICMSP).

5. Requirements.
   
5.1 Technical Requirements: 

Provide a formal methodology and demonstration of the ability to conduct automated metadata tagging of information across heterogeneous data sources applying the ICML.  The data to be processed includes, but is not limited to, softcopy and hard copy text based, formatted messages, desktop publications (including those produced by MS Word, Acrobat, PowerPoint, Excel, as well as other current and past desktop application formats).  

Use of existing metadata should be exploited where feasible.  ICML defines a minimal set of mandatory data elements that must be used.  The proof of concept should attempt to discover and or tag the minimal mandatory set defined in the standard.  Many finished intelligence products and other materials have previously been processed using various forms of metadata to include abstracts, indices, thesauri terms, and product identification codes.  

5.2. Period of Performance.  From Date of Award for a period of Ninety (90) Days.

5.2.1	Task 1. Data analysis.  The Government will provide a mix of unstructured, semi structured and structured data to be used in the proof of concept.  The data will be Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).  A representative mix might include finished intelligence reports, message traffic, and a copy of a database.

	5.2.2	Task 2. Conduct a pilot demonstration to show how data is metadata tagged using various examples of the intelligence legacy data stores based on analysis completed in Task 1. Show how a search accurately returns all relevant data across the data stores.  Explain the capabilities and limitations of the technology and the accuracy associated with the results. Provide the government with an in-depth, detailed technical understanding in an annotated briefing (PowerPoint brief with detailed notes) explaining the technical components used in the pilot to achieve the results.

	5.2.3	Task 3. Based on the results gained from Task 2, validate the expected  costing model for a larger, follow-on effort, identify the best overall strategy for tagging the actual data, test the solution with existing search tools (Intelink is enhancing their search tools to leverage ICML).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number 
DTNH22-03-R-07140 applies and is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-11. Competition for this requirement is full and open. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), has a requirement 

Delivery shall be FOB: Destination to the Vehicle Research and Test Center, 10820 State Route 347 - Building 60, East Liberty, OH 43319 with final inspection and acceptance at destination. 

Type of Contract Award:  NHTSA intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price order.
Introduction

Since 1979 NHTSA has been conducting frontal crash testing using a rigid barrier faced with a force measuring array load cell devices.   Over the years NHTSA, has procured 3 such arrays of load cells using load cells in an array of 4 rows of 9 columns with each load cell having dimensions of approximately 250 by 234 mm.  Recently, NHTSA and other international research groups have been analyzing the data collected from these and other load cell arrays.  Research has indicated that the load cell data is significant for understanding vehicle compatibility in large car / small car crashes.   Several international research groups have developed higher density load cell arrays and have demonstrated significant improvements in the accuracy of the data.  Additionally, the locations of incompatible vehicle structures can be identified with significantly higher accuracy.  


As a result, NHTSA, in cooperation with the members of the International Harmonized Research Agenda compatibility research group have informally recommended using load cell arrays with a maximum load cell size of approximately 125 mm by 125 mm.  Assembling an 8 by 16 array of these load cells can approximate the current NCAP load cell barrier.   This procurement is intended to purchase the load sensing devices used to build a load cell array for frontal barrier testing.  In order to increase the flexibility of this procurement and to promote competition, NHTSA will develop a custom mounting plate and data acquisition system for the load cells purchased in this contract. This allows some design flexibility in the mount configuration and data acquisition connectors, however, an acceptable design must be suitable for repeated use in full frontal crash tests.

Many of the test procedures require deformable faces to be attached to the front of the load cell array.  The individual load cells must be configured with threaded connectors so that deformable faces may optionally be attached to the front of the barrier.  The load cell array may also be utilized for offset testing.  Note this is a smaller 6 by 8 array, but each load cell is similar to the 125 mm by 125 mm dimensions requested in this procurement.
Specific Requirements

NHTSA would like to purchase 134 load cells, 8 by 16 + 6 spares.   Each load cell shall have a mount side and a struck side.  The mount side will be attached to a rigid plate (not part of this procurement) using threaded fasteners.  Test subjects will impact the struck side of the barrier.  The struck side should be flat, square, and must have threaded connectors to allow attachments of honeycomb barrier faces.

Each of the load cells must conform to the following minimum requirements:
	The shape and size of the struck side: square (123.5mm x
         123.5mm)  
	The size of the mount side: No greater than the size of 
         the struck side
	Depth: the depth can vary but must be  < 150 mm
	Force Capacity: 300 kN
	Overload Capacity: 500 kN
	Moment Capacity: 18 kN-m
	Offset Loading Error: < 3 percent of full scale
	Non-Linearity: < 1 percent of full scale
	Hysteresis: < 1 percent of full scale
	Off axis Sensitivity / Crosstalk: < 5 percent of full 
         scale, 
	Stiffness: > 2,000,000 kN/m
	Frequency Response: must be suitable for acquiring data according to the SAE J211/1 CFC60 data channel specification
	Operating temperature range: 25 deg F  - 125 deg F
	Electrical output range: 0.1 to 4 mV/V
	Load cell does not require any on-board amplifiers, AC 
         coupling not required
	The load cell should have a male connector (diameter < 1inch) on the mount side.  The mating female connector with a 4 conductor shielded cable (> 20 ft) is required, but the connector to attach to the data acquisition unit is not required.  
	The 4 conductors should be for 
	+ excitation (2.5 to 10 V)
	- excitation (2.5 to 10 V)
	+ signal ( up to 10 V)
	- signal (up to 10 V)
Deliverables

Vendors shall submit technical drawing(s) and performance specifications, including electrical connections and signal outputs as part of the bid package.  Rough sketches will be accepted as long as the dimensions, connectors, and fasteners are specified.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation FU252233290200 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation document and all incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-06.
This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses under NAICS code 5621111, which has a small business size standard of $10.5 million.
The requirement consists of the following, (CLIN #, Quantity and Unit of Issue, Description;) This statement of work (SOW) details the requirements for the disposal of the solid waste generated at Clear Air Force Station (CAFS).  The services provided to CAFS by the Contractor will be continuous and ongoing.  A schedule will be established that maintains adequate solid waste storage at the facility and meets facility operating requirements. Installation Description; CAFS is located approximately 78 miles southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska on the George Park?s Highway.  The facilities at CAFS support their mission.  The Composite Area includes administration offices (Building 201 and 202), personnel quarters (Buildings 203-204), supply (Building 250 and 252), CAFS Fire Department (Building 251), and vehicle maintenance (Building 196).  The Camp Area buildings include Civil Engineering offices, shops, and storage buildings, auxiliary dorm buildings, and Security Forces.  The coal-fired power plant produces the electricity and heat for the site and includes Buildings 111 to 115.  The current radar system, the Solid State Phased-Array Radar System (SSPARS), is located in Building 800.  One office in building 101 (PMEL) and one office in building 102 (JRCS) are still occupied ten hours a day by a total of five people each day, Monday through Friday.  Otherwise, buildings 101 through 106 are no longer occupied.  Solid Waste Generation and Storage; CAFS employs approximately 80 military personnel, 50 civil service personnel, and 200 contractors. The CAFS facilities include 263 dorm rooms in the Composite Area and 150 dorm rooms in the Camp Area to house these employees.  The majority of the military and half of the civil service personnel consider CAFS their primary residence.  The majority of the contractor personnel live at CAFS for approximately 169 days per year.  CAFS produces approximately 6760 cubic yards or 1690 tons of municipal solid waste per year.  An average of 130 cubic yards or 325 tons of municipal solid waste are generated per week.  CAFS will continue to use Dumpsters for solid waste storage.  The location of the solid waste collection Dumpsters is shown in Figure 3.  Each Dumpster is indicated by a red dot.  Because of the small capacity of the Dumpsters, some areas maintain multiple Dumpsters for solid waste storage.  The Dumpsters are eight-yard flat top, front-loading containers manufactured by the Cascade Container-Fab Company, a Division of McLestkey Enterprises, Inc. and located at 26406 NW 19th Avenue, Ridgefield, WA  98642 (1-800-628-8722).  The Dumpsters have outside dimensions of 80-inch length, 72-inch width, and 75-inch height.  The fork holes run the depth of the Dumpster and are 9 inches high by 4 inches wide.  The Dumpsters are a standard front-loading Dumpster and meet ANSI standard Z245.3.  All trucks with adjustable forks will be compatible with the Dumpsters.  CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS; This section details the requirements of the Contractor to dispose of the solid waste from CAFS.  Disposal; The Contractor will dispose of all solid waste from CAFS in a Landfill approved by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC).  The Denali Borough Landfill is the closest landfill to CAFS that meets these requirements.  The Contractor will provide the CAFS Environmental Health Services Department with a current solid waste disposal permit issued by the ADEC.  The landfill will be inspected by the ADEC as appropriate and the Contractor will provide CAFS Environmental Health Services Department with a copy of all inspections.  Additionally, the Contractor will allow the Air Force or personnel designated by the Air Force to inspect the landfill annually or with a frequency to be established by the Air Force.  Any discrepancies noted by the Air Force designated personnel will be addressed by the Contractor to meet the satisfaction of the Air Force.  Billing; The Contractor will bill the Air Force on a monthly basis, or as determined by the Air Force Finance Manager.  Each invoice will reference the contract number to expedite processing and payment.  A copy of the monthly invoice will be sent to 13 SWS, P.O. Box 40013, Clear AFS, AK 99704-0013. 3.0 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS; The Contractor will provide the Environmental Health Services office with an inventory of all hazardous materials brought onto CAFS property.  The Contractor will properly dispose of any waste produced from the use of hazardous materials at CAFS.  The Contractor will remove all remaining hazardous materials brought to CAFS after the required work has been performed.  
Evaluation of offers will be performed on the basis of price.
