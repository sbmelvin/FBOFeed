Nurse Call System:
The DORN VAMC has a multi-million dollar nurse call system (Ronco) that is set up and configured to work with Hill-Rom The nurse call system is only set up and configured to work with Hill-Rom and other manufacturer would prove to be non-functional. The Ronco system is proprietary and to configure it to new beds other than Hill-Rom is estimated to cost an additional $500,000. The Dorn VAMC currently has supplies to support the Hill-Rom valued at over $15,000 parts inventory available and all 5 biomedical specialists are trained on maintaining these beds. The DORN VAMC cannot go with another manufacturer since this would lead to non-functional nurse call system and long delay repair times and also sending all biomeds to technical training schools. Since quality will be at risk, thus jeopardizing reliability of equipment and safety of our patients.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

<CONTACT>Reese Van Wyen, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 404-2398, Email reese.vanwyen@nrl.navy.mil
<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Notice:</span> This is neither a request for formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or quotes. The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request. There is no solicitation available at this time. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NRL shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or NRL's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objective:</span> Hidden or undetected corrosion and erosion of shipboard piping systems-severe pitting and wall thinning-results in the implementation of damage control procedures while underway (temporary repairs) and/or full repair/replacement of this piping once pierside. These repairs (temporary or full) may limit operations and, possibly, ship capabilities. Further, they are both time consuming and costly.</p>
<p>Once detected, the repair process of the failure is not trivial. It requires shutting down the piping zone in which the repair needs to be completed, locking out of the piping system from use, removing, and then replacing, installation/lagging, installing, if necessary, a temporary repair if underway, and finally cutting out and replacing the damaged piping. This is further exasperated in that current inspection methodologies are also complicated requiring removal, and replacement of, insulation/lagging and a certified ultrasonic assessor. In addition, these inspections can only be executed pierside and are impacted by the limited number of qualified assessors, who are also responsible for ship hull and SUBSAFE inspections within the Fleet.</p>
<p>To advance the current state of piping repair within the Fleet, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) seeks to identify, and to assess, technologies for repairing detected damage within the interior of the piping system without the removal of any insulation/lagging. The objective is to repair, with the future to inspect as well, Copper Nickel systems having pipe diameters between 2 to 6 inches, with the focus on the smallest diameter. In addition, the desire is for the repair approach to operate along significant runs, thereby reducing the amount of impact on the piping system for entry and exit of the unit. Further, this repair unit must be retrievable from the piping system, if there is a failure, without the need to further break down, or cut into, the system. Finally, the initial thought would be that the repair needs to be as long term as possible and possibly consist of a metallic spray or cladding technique, but the RFI is not limited to those options if other technologies are deemed viable (maturity and applicability).</p>
<p>The overarching objective would be to stress technology that can be operated by both industrial shore-side capabilities and sailors, if necessary at sea. Technologies do not have to be presently at such a readiness level for shipboard implementation but have an identifiable realistic path.<br />&emsp;<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submission Format:</span> The NRL asks that interested parties, at a minimum, supply the following information:<br />a) Name of Company and Point of Contact (POC);<br />b) Telephone Number, Fax Number, Address and e-mail address of POC;<br />c) Business Size and number of employees;<br />d) Type of Set Aside (if applicable);<br />e) Capabilities statement and relevant experience in the focus area above.<br /><strong><br />Submissions shall be provided in electronic format only</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Primary Place of Contractor Performance:</span> Contractor's facility</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assumptions:</span> Please provide a list of assumptions, if any, which were considered in formulating the response.</p>

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Notice:</span> This is neither a request for formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or quotes. The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request. There is no solicitation available at this time. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NRL shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or NRL's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objective:</span> Hidden or undetected corrosion and erosion of shipboard piping systems-severe pitting and wall thinning-results in the implementation of damage control procedures while underway (temporary repairs) and/or full repair/replacement of this piping once pierside. These repairs (temporary or full) may limit operations and, possibly, ship capabilities. Further, they are both time consuming and costly.</p>
<p>Once detected, the repair process of the failure is not trivial. It requires shutting down the piping zone in which the repair needs to be completed, locking out of the piping system from use, removing, and then replacing, installation/lagging, installing, if necessary, a temporary repair if underway, and finally cutting out and replacing the damaged piping. This is further exasperated in that current inspection methodologies are also complicated requiring removal, and replacement of, insulation/lagging and a certified ultrasonic assessor. In addition, these inspections can only be executed pierside and are impacted by the limited number of qualified assessors, who are also responsible for ship hull and SUBSAFE inspections within the Fleet.</p>
<p>To advance the current state of piping repair within the Fleet, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) seeks to identify, and to assess, technologies for repairing detected damage within the interior of the piping system without the removal of any insulation/lagging. The objective is to repair, with the future to inspect as well, Copper Nickel systems having pipe diameters between 2 to 6 inches, with the focus on the smallest diameter. In addition, the desire is for the repair approach to operate along significant runs, thereby reducing the amount of impact on the piping system for entry and exit of the unit. Further, this repair unit must be retrievable from the piping system, if there is a failure, without the need to further break down, or cut into, the system. Finally, the initial thought would be that the repair needs to be as long term as possible and possibly consist of a metallic spray or cladding technique, but the RFI is not limited to those options if other technologies are deemed viable (maturity and applicability).</p>
<p>The overarching objective would be to stress technology that can be operated by both industrial shore-side capabilities and sailors, if necessary at sea. Technologies do not have to be presently at such a readiness level for shipboard implementation but have an identifiable realistic path.<br />&emsp;<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submission Format:</span> The NRL asks that interested parties, at a minimum, supply the following information:<br />a) Name of Company and Point of Contact (POC);<br />b) Telephone Number, Fax Number, Address and e-mail address of POC;<br />c) Business Size and number of employees;<br />d) Type of Set Aside (if applicable);<br />e) Capabilities statement and relevant experience in the&nbsp;focus area above.</p>

It requires shutting down the piping zone in which the repair needs to be completed, locking out of the piping system from use, removing, and then replacing, installation/lagging, installing, if necessary, a temporary repair if underway, and finally cutting out and replacing the damaged piping. This is further exasperated in that current inspection methodologies are also complicated requiring removal, and replacement of, insulation/lagging and a certified ultrasonic assessor. In addition, these inspections can only be executed pierside and are impacted by the limited number of qualified assessors, who are also responsible for ship hull and SUBSAFE inspections within the Fleet.</p>
<p>To advance the current state of piping repair within the Fleet, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) seeks to identify, and to assess, technologies for repairing detected damage within the interior of the piping system without the removal of any insulation/lagging. The objective is to repair, with the future to inspect as well, Copper Nickel systems having pipe diameters between 2 to 6 inches, with the focus on the smallest diameter. In addition, the desire is for the repair approach to operate along significant runs, thereby reducing the amount of impact on the piping system for entry and exit of the unit. Further, this repair unit must be retrievable from the piping system, if there is a failure, without the need to further break down, or cut into, the system. Finally, the initial thought would be that the repair needs to be as long term as possible and possibly consist of a metallic spray or cladding technique, but the RFI is not limited to those options if other technologies are deemed viable (maturity and applicability).</p>
<p>The overarching objective would be to stress technology that can be operated by both industrial shore-side capabilities and sailors, if necessary at sea. Technologies do not have to be presently at such a readiness level for shipboard implementation but have an identifiable realistic path.<br />&emsp;<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submission Format:</span> The NRL asks that interested parties, at a minimum, supply the following information:<br />a) Name of Company and Point of Contact (POC);<br />b) Telephone Number, Fax Number, Address and e-mail address of POC;<br />c) Business Size and number of employees;<br />d) Type of Set Aside (if applicable);<br />e) Capabilities statement and relevant experience in the&nbsp;focus area above.</p>

<p>(a) The offeror shall check the following certification:</p>
<p>CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>
<p>(1) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Government purposes, and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontractor) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;</p>
<p>(2) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of equipment.</p>
<p>(i) An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public.</p>
<p>(ii) An "established market price" is a current price, established in the usual course of trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror; and</p>
<p>(3) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract are the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.</p>
<p>(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(c)(3) that the Service Contract Act--</p>
<p>(1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Act of 1965 clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or</p>
<p>(2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment--Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision--</p>
<p>(1) The clause in this solicitation at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment--Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror; and</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible, if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />52.232-18 AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984)</p>
<p>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see Subpart 32.11 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the CCR database" means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service, and has marked the records ``Active.'' The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number-</p>
<p>(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>

<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
