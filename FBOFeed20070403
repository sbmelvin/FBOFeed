Stacking:  A load-stacking test shall be performed once, at the beginning of the contract, for each different unitized or palletized load configuration. A fully palletized load shall be tested utilizing a total stack of three palletized loads, with all the proper bracing and/or reinforcement necessary to perform the test. There shall be no evidence of damage to the pallets, shipping containers or products when stack is tested on the rigid surface for a minimum of 24 hours, in compliance with all the National and Local Safety Regulations. The pre-tested palletized load configuration shall be duplicated using the same packaging materials, pattern, number of shipping (transport) containers, and procedures consistent throughout the duration of the contract. Palletized loads shall be stable and safe when handled with mechanical equipment by qualified personnel.

Materials:  All lumber used inside or outside a shipment shall be bark free. No used wood pallets with repaired components or stringers will be acceptable. All wood pallet stringers shall be manufactured from hardwoods.  Pallets manufactured of materials other than wood, shall conform to all the requirements specified herein.

Unitization:  For the purpose of this requirement, the assembled group of containers or items in a single load that can be handled as a unit throughout the distribution system. Unitization encompasses, but is not limited to, consolidation in a container, placement on a pallet or load base having forklift capability, or securely binding together. Shipments should be considered for unitization where appropriate or specified. 

Unitization of pallet load:  The palletized load shall be unitized and secured to the pallet to insure that the load arrives intact without product damage. The containers or items shall be placed in a suitable pattern to form a stable and balanced load. Vertical, horizontal or filler reinforcement shall be added as necessary to meet the stacking strength requirements. A palletized load shall be secured to the pallet by shrink or stretch wrapping, and/or, by steel or nonmetallic strapping. When steel or nonmetallic strapping is used, edge protectors shall be provided to prevent damage to the cartons when tensioning the strapping. As a minimum, two straps shall run lengthwise, two straps shall run widthwise, and two straps shall run around the girth of the palletized load. A palletized load shall be capable of protecting the products against damage in a multiple handling, transportation, and storage environment having distribution warehouses with rack systems that support the load/s overhead of warehouse personnel.

<SOLNBR>BAA07-26

<CONTACT>Michael Blackstone, Contracting Officer, Phone (571) 218-4804, Fax (703) 696-2208, Email michael.blackstone@darpa.mil
<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is soliciting research proposals in the area of Steep-subthreshold-slope Transistors for Electronics with Extremely-low Power (STEEP). Proposed research should investigate the development of novel transistor technologies that will enable high-performance logic circuits with extremely low power consumption.

The STEEP process developed must be consistent with achieving transistor subthreshold slopes below 60 mV/decade without performance penalty.  Current CMOS technology uses transistors that work by electronically modulating a thermionic energy barrier.  The high energy tail of the carrier (electron or hole) distribution function is responsible for the theoretical subthreshold slope limit for this type of switch of 60 mV/decade.  Innovative approaches are sought to develop transistors based on non-thermionic switching physics.

Additional information on the program objectives and structure is provided in Section I of the BAA 07-26 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The STEEP program will be conducted in three phases each having definite and measurable milestones, the most critical of which will be referred to as Go/No-Go (GNG) metrics.  Each phase will culminate in a specified device and/or circuit demonstration which will serve to validate that the goals of the phase have been achieved.  The period of performance for each of these phases and the milestone schedule will be proposed by offerors within their technical proposals and will be factors considered as part of the source selection process (see below). In general, a shorter phase is preferable, but each phase should clearly be adequate in duration to meet its objectives with reasonable risks and costs. Proposals should discuss plans for managing these factors.

The three distinct phases of the program are:
 
I.	Steep-subthreshold-slope Transistor Development;
II.	Transistor Optimization & Circuit Integration; and
III.	Yield Enhancement.

TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS

Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site (http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams) has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is  Dr. Michael Fritze, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: BAA07-26@darpa.mil. 

PROPOSER’S QUESTIONS

A “Proposer’s Questions,” website will be posted for BAA 07-26 on the DARPA, Microsystems Technology Office solicitations page (www.darpa.mil/baa/#eto).  If you would like to have a question answered and posted on this site, please send your question to the following address: BAA07-26@darpa.mil.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 07-26, Steep-subthreshold-slope Transistors for Electronics with Extremely-low Power (STEEP), Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on areas of interest, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: http://www.grants.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.

In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  The proposal abstract must be submitted to https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, May 18, 2007.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposal abstracts should not be submitted via grants.gov - the "Apply" function will be available for submission of full proposals should University offerors choose to submit in this way.  

Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit a full proposal to https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa, or via grants.gov for Universities wishing to use the "Apply" function, on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, July 27, 2007 in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and Grants.gov.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 07-26, Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.

This requirement is a non-competitive acquisition and no solicitation is available. The proposed acquisition is for Proprietary Software and Database for Market Segmentation in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Claritas Inc, the only source, in accordance with FAR 6.302.1.  The licenses include proprietary mapping software which allows NHTSA to translate data to maps which range in detail from zip code level to the entire country.

Other specific research directly related to NHTSA’s programs includes determining the characteristics of motorcycle riders, part time users of safety belts, people who have cell phones in their cars -- where they live, how to reach them with safety messages.  The determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition is solely within the discretion of the Government.  For additional information, please contact Mr. Anthony Garner via e-mail at   Anthony.garner@dot.gov.

This project may include options, which will be evaluated as part of the award.  The contract performance period is 30 months.

The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope of construction projects with particular emphasis on large cold climate construction projects.  GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: Large cold-climate construction projects requiring the coordination of site work and blasting, paving and new construction of approximately $10 million dollars or more and/or Demolition and construction of a new facility/complex with operations that are 24/7/365 of approximately $10 million dollars or more. The contractor's personnel working in occupied areas will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  This project is designed using metric units and the estimated cost is more than ten million dollars ($10,000,000).  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the ?best value? to the Government in terms of price and technical merit, and, whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, qualified/experienced personnel, management plan/technical approach, subcontracting opportunities, and on their price proposals.   

The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors. Phase 2 - development of an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms. In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not they will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor. GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors, and the basis of GSA's opinion. GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<CONTACT>Robert Benion 202-781-1166 Richelle Deitenbeck 202-781-1213 richelle.deitenbeck@navy.mil
<DESC>The Department of Defense is initiating a spiral development effort to counter both the existing threat posed by Radio Controlled Improvised Electronic Devices (RC-IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the long-term worldwide RC-IED threat.  The first spiral will develop a near-term technologically advanced solution to the RC-IED threats in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The first spiral will provide improved performance against advanced threats in a complex Electro Magnetic Environment, increased effectiveness ranges, and improved interoperability with other Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems. To execute the first spiral, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) plans to release one or more draft RFPs in early first quarter of the Government’s Fiscal Year 2007, and a formal RFP in early/mid Fiscal Year 2007.  This RFP will result in a cost plus research and development  contract(s).  Contract award will be based on a best value analysis considering technical performance (system design, produciblity, supportability) and costs.   The NAVSEA intends to award one or more contracts for the design, development, fabrication, and test of a man portable (dismounted) CREW (3.1) system, in second quarter Fiscal Year 2007.  The ensuing contract(s) will be for the design and fabrication of up to ten systems, support testing evaluation of the systems, and provide engineering support to address problems and weakness identified during testing.  Successful offerors will have approximately 12 months to design, fabricate and test a dismounted system. The period of performance will include an initial design phase of approximately five months leading to a joint (contractor/government) test phase, and then followed by two additional design and test phases.  Five systems, including potential upgrades between test cycles, will be used to support the first two sets of tests.  Five additional systems will be used for the third and final test cycle. The Navy anticipates testing at various test facilities located on both the !  east and west coasts.  The successful offeror(s) will be responsible for the delivery of the appropriate number of systems to each of the two test facilities.    At the completion of this contract, the Navy anticipates conducting a limited competition between the successful offerers to select one or more sources to fabricate and deliver nominally 1,500 man portable (dismounted) CREW systems.  The production contract will also include shipping containers, training, associated data, spares, engineering support services, as well as, field and depot support.

The Ford Island Bridge Facility is comprised of pile supported viaduct structures, hinged 120 and 250 foot composite steel/Portland cement concrete transition spans and a 930 foot long movable concrete pontoon section at the navigation harbor channel.  The bridge?s concrete components are constructed of Portland cement with a micro-silica fume additive.  The movable pontoon section retracts back under the raised transition spans to provide a clear opening for the passage of ships.  The pontoon extends and locks in place with the lowered transition spans to provide vehicle passage across the bridge.  The retraction and extension operation is accomplished automatically by a programmable logic controller, pre-programmed to sequence the hydraulic operated transition span lift cylinders and winch to control the pontoon?s movement.  A microwave communication system transmits control signals to synchronize the hydraulic operated lift cylinders across the bridge open channel.  This contract will include preventive maintenance (including bridge operation), service calls, and repairs.  The work will include the bridge?s viaduct, hinged transition spans, movable pontoon, hydraulic systems (which includes the hydraulic controlled machinery and lift cylinders), microwave communications, integrated bridge control system, pontoon leak detection, closed circuit television, roadway traffic signal and control, fire and intrusion detection, bridge electrical systems, catwalks and landings, and other supporting components necessary to maintain the bridge?s operational and safety standards.  The repairs will include service and construction work.  The intent of the construction type of repairs is limited to cosmetic and minor structural repairs.  This contract is not intended to perform major construction work.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the procurement of services to develop parallel multilevel low rank methods for fullwave scattering and simulation of large scattering structures of interest to NASA. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from the University of Washington. The Principal Investigator for the University of Washington has demonstrated the capability to achieve a computational complexity of N log and has been the first to achieve this using a hybrid Fast Multi-level QR/Fast Multipole Method (FMQR/FMM) technique. Other methods using only FMM suffer from a well known low-frequency breakdown and problems with accuracy in near-field calculations. Achieving parallelization enables dramatically larger problems to be solved in much faster times and with very low memory usage. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The NTSB has a need for management and operation services of its Training Center.  The Training Center is a state of the art learning facility currently operated by NTSB.  Although the Training Center has grown since it was opened in 2003, there is significant potential to increase revenue. The NTSB is a federal agency with expertise in investigating transportation accidents and making safety recommendations to improve transportation safety.  The NTSB requires an organization with expertise in managing and operating an educational / conference facility in order to maximize revenue. The NTSB anticipates awarding an IDIQ type contract and issuing individual Task Orders to meet the needs of this requirement.  The scope of this requirement is separated into three main functional areas:   FUNCTIONAL AREA 01 - Facility Management FUNCTIONAL AREA 02 - NTSB Sponsored Course & Event Management FUNCTIONAL AREA 03 - NTSB Sponsored Course Development The NTSB does not intend to issue funded task orders for all of these functional areas.  Functional Areas 01 and 02, Facility Management and NTSB Sponsored Course & Event Management, shall be revenue sharing task orders. Through fees collected from these functional areas, the total gross revenue generated is shared between the NTSB and the contractor.   Functional Area 03, NTSB Sponsored Course Development, requires the contractor to develop, market, schedule, and instruct new classes sponsored by the NTSB.  This may include development of curriculum, syllabus, lesson plans, instructor qualifications, course materials, etc.  The NTSB will negotiate and fund individual task orders that will include the specific information for each course.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE;  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Office National de l'Electricit?, Direction des Approvisionnement et Marches, 65, Rue Othman Ben Affan, 20000 Casablanca, Morocco. Phone :  (212) 22-66-82-67, Fax:  (212) 22- 43-31-12 Morocco ONE Reorganization Technical Assistance.  The Grantee, the Moroccan Office National de l'Electricite (ONE)) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance on reorganizing ONE's corporate structure with the perspective of liberalizing Morocco's electricity sector.

The Government of Morocco (GOM) has been moving towards restructuring the country's electricity sector over the past few years.  The most concrete step towards liberalization is occurring now as the final language of the electricity sector reform act is being reviewed by the Ministry of Energy for submission to the Parliament.  ONE supports the liberalization and has been directly involved in developing the legislation, which is expected to be approved during 2006.  As the largest actor in Morocco's electricity sector, the electricity sector reform act's liberalization legislation ("liberalization legislation") will significantly impact ONE through major revisions to the company's mandate and the creation of an open and regulated electricity market.  

ONE is a publicly owned utility company and it is the principal actor in Morocco's electricity sector, with a monopoly on electricity transmission and the largest distribution grid in-country.  With regards to power production, ONE owns and operates power plants and since 1994 it has held long-term contracts with private producers.  ONE currently fulfills the mission of single purchaser in Morocco; all Moroccan power plants sell all of their production to the company, which in turn sells it to the distribution companies, and industrial end users.  ONE manages all high voltage transmission lines, and for customers not covered by distribution companies (which account for 50% of their sales) it manages all medium and low voltage transmission lines.  In response to the GOM's planned restructuring of the electricity sector and the upcoming liberalization legislation, ONE's operations will change and it must reorganize itself to best meet its revised mandate.  
 
The reform consists of liberalizing the electricity sector in order to create increased competition to supply high and medium voltage customers (for eligible customers excluding distributors) and drive electricity prices more competitive.  In addition, the reform would create a specific responsibility for ONE to deliver electricity to the remaining customers (including distributors) under a regulated market.  In essence, the liberalization will create an Open Market and a Regulated Market.  All customers on high and medium voltage will be progressively eligible customers for the Open Market.  An exception is for the distribution companies, which will remain in the Regulated Market.  The reform will cause the formation of a Regulator who will take on various functions of the Ministry of Energy and ONE, including setting regulated tariffs and rules for the Open Market.  Any licensed operator or power exporter/importer will be able to contract directly with eligible customers.  

ONE will remain the transmission company in Morocco outside of the distribution companies.  It will wheel power for Open Market suppliers and customers.  ONE will also remain the single purchaser for the Regulated Market.  All existing Moroccan power generation will be put to the Regulated Market.  The clear goal of the liberalization legislation is to create more competitively priced power for industrial and commercial customers so that they can become more competitive in their production costs.  An eligible customer may enter into a long term contract, or acquire electricity under short term supply conditions.  Eventually the Regulated Market medium voltage customers will gradually become eligible customers for the Open Market. 

In anticipation of the GOM's liberalization legislation, ONE has already implemented a partial reorganization with the advice of an U.S. consulting firm.  Among the changes it enacted, ONE created several divisions with individual profit and loss responsibility, allocating some functions into more suitable divisions.  But under the liberalization legislation, ONE will need to "corporatize" itself further and convert certain divisions into subsidiaries as defined in the proposed legislation.  ONE wishes to:  remain an efficient organization post-reform, ensure it can continue to remain competitive in both the regulated and liberalized market, and continue to fulfill its mandate to deliver electricity (its own or third party) at suitable costs to the end-user.  The liberalization legislation will require strict separation between the Open Market and Regulated Market businesses with which ONE will be directly involved, both as the main transmission company and as a power producer and importer.  In addition to obtaining advice on the establishment of the main subsidiaries, ONE wishes to evaluate the need to create a support subsidiary (or more) to provide services that can be shared by the main subsidiaries.  Finally, ONE seeks assistance in devising an implementation plan for the reorganization and support to initiate that plan.  To address these various needs, ONE has requested U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funding for Technical Assistance to help the company optimize its reorganization.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $820,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<CONTACT>Clint Druk, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-0403, Fax 301-443-8488, Email clint.druk@psc.gov
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with The Advertising Council Inc. (The Ad Council), on a sole sources basis, under the authority of the Office on Women?s Health (OWH) to plan and implement a national lupus awareness campaign.     The basis for restricting competition is the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1 because only one source is available to provide the service in a manner that will satisfy agency requirements.     The anticipated contract period will be for one base year with two, one year option periods.     

OWH requires the services of a contractor to provide support for the production, development and promotion of a nationwide public service campaign addressing lupus awareness.     The purpose of this procurement is to obtain services to plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a national lupus marketing campaign to increase the awareness of lupus symptoms and health effects and provide information to individuals who may be at risk for lupus to help them decide whether they should seek professional medical evaluation.     Moreover, the contractor will design and carryout a series of evaluation activities to capture the results of the campaign.     The campaign is encouraged by Congress and will generate long overdue public attention for lupus and raise recognition of the disease as a significant national public health problem that disproportionately affects young women of color.

The Ad Council is uniquely positioned, through its partnerships, non-profit status, and standing as a nationally respected organization to garner widespread support from media experts for this campaign.     The Ad Council has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to produce substantial results for expansive awareness campaigns.     These characteristics allow The Ad Council to leverage a limited Government investment to perform the requirement over a longer period of time with increased output.

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to perform the work described above.     Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government?s requirement as articulated above.     Any interested source, in order to meet OWH requirements will need to demonstrate and address in their capability statement (1) strong past experience with nationwide health advertising campaigns and (2) the ability to marshal and leverage volunteer talent from the advertising and communications industries, the facilities of the media, and the resources of the business and non-profit communities to plan and implement a nationwide lupus awareness campaign.     No solicitation document is available.     Capability statements should be submitted by 10 a.m. Eastern Time on May 21, 2007 to the point of contact listed in this announcement.     See note 22.

JUSTIFICATION FOR PURCHASING REMINGTON MODEL 870 PARTS

Remington Arms is the sole manufacturer of Remington Model 870 shotguns, and all necessary parts required to maintain, repair, and rebuild said weapon.

These repair parts will enable the DS Weapon Armorers to repair and rebuild Remington shotguns, and ascertain that all of the Remington shortens are safe and reliably functional.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as key components of the Department’s networking system. Equipment listed above are required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that require two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as key components of the Department’s networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) has undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.    The requirement will be set-aside for GSA schedule holders only.  GSA has already determined the prices to be fair and reasonable.  The Government will award a delivery order to the offer that represents the overall best value.<BR><BR>MODIFIED LINE ITEM 005 CONFIGURATION<BR><BR>

The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the products -- however software support is a separate expense and represents an ongoing annual expenditure. PeopleSoft products are the basis for much of ILMS.  The PeopleSoft products currently used by ILMS include: PeopleSoft Inventory, PO, CRM Support server license, Object Studio,  Balanced Scorecard,  Enterprise Warehouse,  Supply Chain Management,  Activity Based Management,  GL, and AM modules A full description of the software maintenance services that are required can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for Mythics.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from Mythics, the firm that is certified to resell software support by Oracle/Peoplesoft.  Software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS.   ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System.  In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc.  ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support.  Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>ADDED DETAIL OF ANNUAL MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT.<BR><BR>

DESCRIPTION
(Note: This BAA Addendum 4 is submitted as a Special Focus Area as described in the original BAA, 07-21.)

The design and manufacture of advanced materials and material systems is critical to all DoD systems. DARPA seeks innovative proposals for the development of a new class of synthetic evolvable materials that will enable radical new capabilities in the functionality, survivability, lethality, and manufacturability of materials for military systems. For the purposes of this BAA, synthetic evolvable materials are defined as non-biological materials that utilize environmental cues to autonomously self-organize, self-propagate, and self-select specific internal configurations for the purposes of optimizing or maintaining system functionality under dynamically changing conditions. Synthetic evolvable materials will require minimal energy input to function, e.g., exhibit auto-amplification, and have an intrinsic “memory” or an embedded instruction set that encodes the present state of the material. We envision that synthetic evolvable materials will have the intrinsic capacity to autonomously adapt their structure/properties to changing external conditions over a broad range of lengthscales and timescales as required. This is akin to the way that biological materials exhibit functionalities such as antigen/antibiotic resistance, metabolic control, and reflexes.

Heterogeneous combinations of sensing materials, actuators, processing electronics, and power sources are not considered in this BAA.  

PROGRAM COMPONENTS

The concept of evolvable materials is very broad and encompasses a diverse set of scientific and engineering disciplines. To narrow down the concept and to focus initial efforts in this broad area, DARPA is seeking proposals that address one or more of the following technical topics:

1)	Development of nonequilibrium material systems: Many biological systems are known to operate in a nonequilibrium state. This enables them to be very agile and responsive to environmental cues and allows them to change states with only minimal energy input. One aspect of this BAA is to develop the theoretical basis and experimental demonstration of synthetic material systems that utilize nonequilibrium dynamics productively for the purpose of changing state in response to environmental cues. 

2)	Self-organizing, self-propagating, and self-selecting networks: The concept of self-organization and self-assembly is central to the synthesis of biological materials. Furthermore, biological networks often incorporate signaling processes that consist of a cascade of events triggered by energy input at one node of the network. In this manner, biological systems can propagate information over long distances with modest energy input. One goal of this BAA is to develop synthetic analogs to self-organizing, self-propagating, and self-selecting networks. Such a development may enable new means of information transfer in non-biological material systems or new means of introducing large changes in a system or network with only small amounts of energy input at a discrete location, e.g., autoamplification. 

3)	Response to environmental cues: Environmental pressures cause adaptation in biological systems over an immense range of time scales. Examples of short time scale response include the thermal control system of a warm-blooded animal that causes perspiration in response to elevated external temperature. Over long time scales, environmental pressures can cause adaptation of whole populations to new conditions. In all of these cases, the adaptation is intrinsic to the biological system. Through this BAA, DARPA seeks to incorporate intrinsic changes to environmental cues into synthetic material systems. The purpose of these changes would be to optimize functionality and performance at the system level. Once again, we emphasize that the responsive properties of evolvable materials must be intrinsic, and not the result of a heterogeneous combination of sensors, actuators, and external control systems. 

PROGRAM GOALS AND MILESTONES

This request is for modestly priced proposals of not more than 6 months in length that are focused exclusively on the elements described above. It is expected that the total funding under this BAA Addendum 4 will be at the level of $1M to $2M and a total of 3-6 awards will be made. The success of these individual efforts will be a major factor in determining whether a more extensive DARPA program in this area is initiated. The government reserves the right to fund no proposals under this BAA or award without discussions. 

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

Full Proposal Submission Guidelines
Full proposal submissions must follow the guidelines set forth in BAA 07-21. Full proposals must be received by 4:00 PM ET, May 22, 2007. Proposals received after this time will not be considered.

The technical volume of the full proposal must include the following:

1)	Notional concept for the synthetic evolvable material system.
2)	A clear discussion of the relevance of the notional concept to the program component(s) discussed above.
3)	Detailed supporting analysis of the scientific and technical challenges associated with the development of the evolvable material system.
4)	A discussion of the DoD impact of the proposed evolvable material system.
5)	Listing of team members, relevant capabilities, and a management plan.
6)	Budget for a 6-month effort.
7)	A listing of intermediate milestones and 6-month milestones for the effort.

Evaluation of Proposals
Evaluation of the proposals will be in accordance with BAA 07-21. For general administrative questions, please refer to the original FEDBIZOPPS solicitation, BAA07-21, of February 14, 2007: http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm.

<DESC>The Department of Defense is initiating a spiral development effort to counter both the existing threat posed by Radio Controlled Improvised Electronic Devices (RC-IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the long-term worldwide RC-IED threat.  The first spiral will develop a near-term technologically advanced solution to the RC-IED threats in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The first spiral will provide improved performance against advanced threats in a complex Electro Magnetic Environment, increased effectiveness ranges, and improved interoperability with other Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems. To execute the first spiral, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) plans to release one or more draft RFPs in early first quarter of the Government’s Fiscal Year 2007, and a formal RFP in early/mid Fiscal Year 2007.  This RFP will result in a cost plus research and development  contract(s).  Contract award will be based on a best value analysis considering technical performance (system design, produciblity, supportability) and costs.   The NAVSEA intends to award one or more contracts for the design, development, fabrication, and test of a man portable (dismounted) CREW (3.1) system, in second quarter Fiscal Year 2007.  The ensuing contract(s) will be for the design and fabrication of up to ten systems, support testing evaluation of the systems, and provide engineering support to address problems and weakness identified during testing.  Successful offerors will have approximately 12 months to design, fabricate and test a dismounted system. The period of performance will include an initial design phase of approximately five months leading to a joint (contractor/government) test phase, and then followed by two additional design and test phases.  Five systems, including potential upgrades between test cycles, will be used to support the first two sets of tests.  Five additional systems will be used for the third and final test cycle. The Navy anticipates testing at various test facilities located on both the !  east and west coasts.  The successful offeror(s) will be responsible for the delivery of the appropriate number of systems to each of the two test facilities.    At the completion of this contract, the Navy anticipates conducting a limited competition between the successful offerers to select one or more sources to fabricate and deliver nominally 1,500 man portable (dismounted) CREW systems.  The production contract will also include shipping containers, training, associated data, spares, engineering support services, as well as, field and depot support.     The draft and final RFP will be published on FEDBIZOPS.  Interested Offerors should watch FEDBIZOPS for the release of the RFP.  Requests for a RFP should not be submitted to the points of contact (POCs) listed in this Synopsis.  Only questions pertaining to the Sysnopsis should be submitted to the POCs

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to respond to the following questions that have been received from potential offerors.   Q1.  Could you tell me if this is a new requirement or a re-competition? If it is a re-competition, could you provide the incumbent name as well as the contract number?  A1.  This is a new requirement. Q2.  In the pre-solicitation notice, the language "Each joint venture if given a task order must be able to perform all the work on the task order independently" can be interpreted one of two ways:  Firstly, literally any subcontractors contribution to the team is considered inconsequential and will not be evaluated as part of the selection process, or  Secondly, each joint venture member must be able to perform all the work on the task order independently (should it state "Each joint venture member if given a task order must be able to perform all the work on the task order independently").   Which interpretation is correct? Could we please get clarification on the intentions of this statement? A2.  Subcontractor?s contribution to the team is not considered inconsequential and will be evaluated as part of the selection process.   The intent is to give preference to those SDVOB firms that can show the capability to perform all of the work on the task order independently. Q3.  Please confirm that the 50-page limit applies only to Part I of the SF 330.  In our experience other Agencies typically apply page limitations only to Section I.  The number of pages in SF 330 Part II (the replacement for the old SF254 form) is determined by (1) the number of office locations that the offeror proposes to use in performing the RAC and (2) the number of individual firms on the offeror?s team. Therefore, including Part II within the page limits would affect different offerors unequally and could limit the opportunities for additional small business partners to join offerors? teams. A3.  The 50 page limit applies to Part I, Part II and any attachments of the SF 330. Q4.  Please consider removing the one-inch margin requirement in the submittal instructions so that the SF330 can conform to the forms published in the Federal Register. The original SF 330 forms published in the Federal Register have margins of less than one inch. A one-inch margin, combined with the 10-point font, will be unwieldy, particularly in the Part I Section G table and the Part II form. A4.  The one inch margin requirement is removed and has been replaced with a ? inch margin requirement to allow offerors to conform to the SF 330 published in the Federal Register.  Q5.  The Pre-solicitation requires the electronic versions of the SF330 to be submitted in both ?MS Word and WordPerfect.? We expect to compose the RAC II SF330 in MS Word. To furnish the WordPerfect version, we would need to convert the files. This type of file conversion often causes formatting and layout errors that require significant rework to fix.  Please consider electronic file submission in either, but not both, MS Word or WordPerfect coupled with a version in Adobe PDF format to more readily accommodate submission of signed documents. A5. EPA will require one (1) electronic copy on disc in either format (MS Word or Word Perfect). Q6.   If required, where should the "Joint Venture Agreement" be provided in the SF330 submittal package?  If required electronically, we request that it be required only as part of the Adobe PDF electronic submittal. A6. The Joint Venture Agreement may be provided in the Adobe PDF electronic format. Q7.  Please confirm that, if required, the "Joint Venture Agreement" does not count in the page limitation for the SF330. A7.  The Joint Venture Agreement will not count in the page limitation for the SF330s. Q8.   Under Criterion 2 specialized experience, the solicitation refers to sections E, G, H and Part II, but does not refer to Section F.  Will the information provided in Section F, project descriptions, also be considered in the evaluation of this criterion? A8.   Yes, the information provided in Section F, project descriptions, will also be considered in the evaluation criterion 2. Q9. Would you please add my contact information to your list for this solicitation? A9.  A mailing list for this solicitation is not being maintained at this time.  According to the synopsis, EPA is requiring that all interested offerors submit the SF-330 "Architect-Engineer Qualifications" statement.   Q10.  Does past performance have to be limited to that of the prime contractor or will the past performance of the sub contractors be allowed as well? A10.  Past performance will be limited to the prime contractor.     Q11.  Are the SF 330, Part IIs, excluded from the 50-page limit? A11. No. (See the answer to question #3).   Q12.  Does a cover letter count in the 50-page limit? A12.  Yes, the cover letter will count in the 50 page limit; however, a cover page is not required nor will it be considered in the evaluation. Q13.  Suggest changing margins from 1 inch to no less than ? inch. A13.  Yes. (See the answer to question #4). Q14. Can we use 11" x 17" sheets in our submittal for graphics or tables?  If yes, do they count as 1 page? A14. No.  Offerors cannot use 11" x 17" sheets for graphics or tables.   Q15.  The anticipated services include "site management." Please clarify the meaning of "site management." A15.  Site Management:  To assist the Agency in the management of Superfund activities at various sites in accordance with the Remedial Action II Lite statement of work.   Q16.  Are there any required key resumes (Program Manager or Financial Manager)? Does EPA have a preference for what key personnel should be included? A16.  Yes.  Key resumes are required for the Program Manager.  The Program Manager must remain in place for 120 days. Q17.  Is the contractor allowed to submit only one (1) combined Part II for all the prime offices listed in Section A-C? A17.  No, a combined Part II for all prime offices is not allowed.   Q18.  Can a company-wide Part II be included instead of a Part II for each branch office? A18.  No, a company-wide Part II is not allowed.   Q19.  Will there be a Pre-Proposal conference? A19.  No, there will not be a pre-proposal conference. Q20.  We don?t do anything with the spread of chemicals, but we do conduct vulnerability assessments of structures that may house harmful chemicals.  Would this solicitation address anything like that?   A20.  Please refer to the statement of work and other regulatory requirements referenced in the statement of work.   A20.  Please refer to the statement of work and other regulatory requirements referenced in the statement of work.

<DESC>Automated Letter Movement System (ALMS)
Modification 2 to the
FBO’s Posting


USPS Responses to questions that have been raised concerning the ALMS:

1. Question: Is the solicitation meant only for pre-qualified GMHS EFI suppliers? 
USPS Response: No.

2. Question: Is there a published specification or a solicitation package for this project? 
USPS Response: No.

3. Question: How many sites will have this system installed?  
USPS Response: The evaluation system will be in one site, maximum number for possible follow on production is 250 sites

4. Question: How many copies of the ALMS Proposal are required? 
USPS Response:  One soft copy or four hard copies. A soft copy is preferred.

5. Question: Will the respondents receive Terms & Conditions and Provisions? 
USPS Response:  The successful supplier (s) will receive appropriate terms and conditions as a part of contract award.

6. Question: What is the anticipated date for the field engineering prototype evaluation?  
USPS Response:  The desired time frame for the field engineering prototype evaluation is between June 2007 and April 2008. 

7. Question: Where will Technical Review Meetings (TRM) be held?  
USPS Response: Technical review meetings will be held at the selected supplier's facility.   Meetings will not be more frequent than once a month, and could be less frequent than once a month.  Frequency of meetings will depend on schedule and program progress.

8. Question: Will a reduced content monthly report be sufficient for the prototype program?  
USPS Response: Yes.

9. Question: Should pricing be for a field proof of concept evaluation and engineering prototype? USPS Response: Yes, it should be firm fixed pricing for a field proof of concept evaluation of an engineering prototype system. Additionally, it should be accompanied by a white paper that describes the functionality of your company’s concept for a production model. Your response must be delivered no later than 5:00 pm April 30, 2007

10. Question: What is/are the evaluation criteria for the solution? Will it be evaluated at the national network level?
USPS Response: Proposals (White Papers) for the proof of concept will be evaluated on technical feasibility, schedule, and cost. 

11. Question: When will an Award for a prototype contract be made?
USPS Response: June/July 

12. Question: What is the expected delivery time of the Prototype for proof of concept? 
USPS Response: Supplier to propose based on contract award 


13. Question: When does the USPS anticipate awarding the deployment contract? 
USPS Response: Between six and twelve months after completion of formal test. 

14. Question: Is the proposed system intended for moving individual (discrete) letters from the AFCS (input) system to the DBCS (output) system or moving trays of letters from the AFCS systems to the DBCS systems?       
USPS Response: It is not the intent of the USPS to purchase/evaluate a tray system.   The intention is to move mail from an AFCS to a DBCS without putting the mail into a tray.

15. Question: Is there a published interfacing specification for querying the DBCS systems to extract DBCS sort plan information?
USPS Response: No, it will be necessary to develop one as part of this effort.

16. Question: Is the AFCS to DBCS transport system to be composed of a conventional 24 VDC motorized roller conveyor system? 
USPS Response:  It is not our intention to limit or direct potential solutions.

17. Question: Does distributing mail to DBCS require automatically loading DBCS mail on feed table? 
USPS Response: The mail is to be fed into the DBCS automatically without operator involvement

18. Question: Is there a time requirement between distributing mail from input to output systems? 
USPS Response:  There is no specific time requirement, but the mail is not to be buffered. 

19. Question: Are there any size requirements? 
USPS Response:  There are no specific size requirements, but potential suppliers need to keep in mind that space is limited in most processing facilities. 

20. Question: Will the engineering prototype be limited to the AFCS input system? 
USPS Response:  Yes, the input for the engineering prototype will be limited to AFCS machines. 

21. Question: How many inputs are to be connected to how many outputs? 
USPS Response:  For the proof of concept, two inputs to one output. For production, four to six inputs connected to two to three outputs. 

22. Question: Will the process modification (different sorting depth and criteria) be acceptable and the automation increase evaluated?
USPS Response:  Any modification that will add value will be evaluated.  Increased value will offset cost. 
23. Question: What level of automation is requested? Fully with minor exceptions (typical missorts and rejects) or partially admitting some mail (define %) still to enter AFCS stackers?
USPS Response:  Full. The only mail that goes to a stacker on the AFCS should be intentionally directed to that stacker. 

24. Question: Are the AFCS already equipped with reverter function, i.e. mail can exit the AFCS with stamp in the upper leading edge side?
USPS Response:  Yes. 

25. Question: What is the layout of the plant and /or of involved systems? Available spaces / capability of extend in height?
USPS Response:  Two AFCS are side by side, DBCS is across the aisle. Only possible available space near the machines is three feet on either side of the aisle. Available height is approximately fourteen feet. 

26. Question: What are the Legacy systems performances (Wall clock and nominal throughput, belt speed, minimum gap etc.)?
USPS Response:  AFCS: throughput 32K, belt speed 3.8 m/sec, min gap 120 mm. DBCS: throughput 40K, belt speed 4.0 m/sec, min gap 100 mm. 

27. Question:  What is the percentage distribution of the three (3) types of mail (FIM, Local, Outgoing)?
USPS Response:  FIM 35%, Local 51%, Outgoing 14%.  These numbers are for the potential test site. National numbers may vary.  

28. Question:  Will the Field Proof of Concept prototype system just show link capabilities with no process alteration or can the system show also process modifications?
USPS Response:  The prototype system must show link capability with no process alteration. 


29. Question: Will the USPS provide a detailed technical, electrical, mechanical, and communications specification between the ALM, AFCS and DBCS?
USPS Response:  The ALMS does not exist; therefore, the ALMS-to-AFCS and ALMS-to-DBCS interfaces do not exist.  Interfaces are to be developed and defined as part of the engineering proof of concept.

30. Question: Will the ALMS be required to buffer mail?  Please provide a comprehensive concept of postal operations for the ALMS?
USPS Response: There is no requirement for the ALMS to buffer mail.  However, the converse is not true; there is no requirement that the ALMS not buffer mail.  Postal operations will be dependent on the solution proposed by the supplier.

31. Question: In regard to the anticipated proposal, the RFP states "Proposals will be evaluated on total cost to implement, functional risk, and performance risk." In order to provide a total cost to implement proposal, we need to know the number of AFCS and DBCS to be interconnected on a site by site basis. Additionally, a total cost to implement type proposal indicates that a program support infrastructure, i.e., spare parts, training, operator and maintenance manuals, etc. are to be included.  What are the requirements for these?? 
USPS Response: The current effort is for an engineering proof of concept.  It is currently envisioned that the engineering proof of concept will connect either 2 AFCS machines to 1 DBCS or 2 AFCS machine to 2 DBCS machine.  The performance and capability of the supplier's engineering proof of concept along with their cost estimates will be used to determine if there is a follow-on production effort, the number of sites, and the number and type of machines connected.  For the purposes of developing an estimate, the supplier should determine the amount of ILS support (e.g. training, spares, etc.) that is required to ensure a 98% operational availability.

32. Question: Will there be a local Ethernet subnet provided by USPS to keep network traffic for the ALMS off the main USPS LAN?  
USPS Response: If the selected supplier requires and requests a local Ethernet subnet, one will be provided.

33. Question: During the evaluation phase, between operational times of about 8 to 9 hours - Will the system and machines will be available to our personnel for resolving issues and testing?  
USPS Response: The system will be available to the supplier during non-operational periods.

34. Question: What is the layout of the plant where the prototype system is going to be tested, or the most likely plant where is going to be tested.  
USPS Response: The USPS is attempting to obtain layout, but may not have it before responses are due.  The prototype will connect two AFCS machines, which are next to each other, and a DBCS.  A potential DBCS is across an aisle from the AFCS machines.  The aisle is approximately between 20 and 30 feet) wide.  The feeder on a potential DBCS is approximately 70 to 90 feet from the stacker side of the furthest AFCS. 
 
35. Question: What is the configuration of AFCSs and DBCSs to be connected? 
USPS Response: The AFCS machines are engineering prototypes of the AFCS 200.  The DBCS will be a DBCS II, III, IV or V.

36. Question: Indication if aisle crossing (transports) will have to be at high level (over 7 foot / 2.1 m) or for the proof of concept can they be at low level 
USPS Response:  Aisle crossing will need to allow traffic to still move in the aisle. 

37. Question: Can the AFCSs and DBCSs to be connected be moved or shall we adapt to existing floor configuration? 
USPS Response: Need to adapt to existing floor plan if possible.  If the machine must be moved, it will be necessary to include the cost of moving the machines as part of proposal evaluation.

38. Question: Are the AFCSs that are to be connected already retrofitted with a reverter?
USPS Response: Yes 
•         
39. Question: Does the USPS have plans to move AFCSs closer to DBCSs 
USPS Response: No 

40. Question: What is the estimated duration for testing?
USPS Response: Formal test between two and four weeks.  Suppliers should plan for the prototype to be operational for three to six months. 

41. Question: What are the test criteria? 
USPS Response: Test plan will be developed jointly with the supplier.  Possible criteria: jams, mis-sorted mail, damaged mail, maintenance stops, down time. 

42. Question: What are the types of assistance that can be requested (maintenance only, operations, etc)? 
USPS Response: At a minimum, maintenance assistance and depending on the complexity of the system, operational. 

43. Question: How many plants will be retrofitted with this system or how many systems?  
USPS Response: Will be determined after formal test based on potential savings and cost of system. 

44. Question:  Will there be an opportunity to hold discussions with the USPS team. 
USPS Response:  Yes, April 10, 2007, Project Management Conference Room at 8403 Lee Highway (Dewey Bldg), Merrifield, VA 22082-8150 at 10:00 am.  A group session followed by individual breakout sessions, is planned. Contact Allyn S. Matthews, C.P.M. at (703) 280-7807.

<DESC>CLARIFICATION OF PROPOSAL BONDING REQUIREMENTS. The Standard Form 1442 indicates in block 13.B that an offer guarantee is required (not to exceed 20% of total bid amount). This has caused potential confusion because this is a two-part selection process, and the Proposal Bond requirement applies to Part 2 of the Source Selection process. Section 00110 explains the Pro Forma requirements for both Part 1 and Part 2 as follows:  PART 1 - PERFORMANCE CAPABILITY PROPOSAL, TAB A  Part 1 Pro Forma Requirements.  This Part 1 requirement calls for: Evidence of Bonding Capacity: Submit a letter of commitment from a surety, signed by an officer or agent authorized to bond, that identifies the offerors available bonding capacity and limits that the surety will bond th e Offeror, as the successful awardee for this project, taking into consideration the Cost Ceiling Limitation described in this Solicitation.  PART 2B - PRICE PROPOSAL, TAB A  Part 2 Pro Forma Requirements.  This Part 2 requirement calls for the submission of an actual Proposal Bond, along with other Pro Forma requirements.  The point of clarification is that the offer guarantee (Proposal Bond) is a Part 2 requirement only. For Part 1, the only bond requirement is the evidence of bonding capacity as described above.

<DESC>Background Statement and Purpose

The Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority has the responsibility to operate safely in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs).  To facilitate aircraft operations, trained, certified air traffic controllers have to direct aircraft entering, departing and moving through the Iraqi airports? airspace and its environs.  Currently, the Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority (ICAA) and the US Government, through a contract with DynCorp International, are training Iraqi personnel to handle the Air Traffic Control (ATC) functions. At this time, the Iraqi trainees have not acquired the required experience necessary to manage the air traffic control functions in all locations.  At the present time, the United States Air Force (USAF) provides air traffic services in most locations, with Iraqi trainees beginning to assume some functions.  

By April 2007, the ICAA controllers will initiate a three phased process to assume the primary air traffic control responsibilities in the high altitude enroute airspace, and later, assume primary control of other parts of the Iraqi air traffic control system. The current structure of the Iraqi Enroute airspace is broken up into three Areas:  Baghdad North (Kirkuk Sector), Baghdad, (Balad Sector) and Baghdad South (Ali Sector).  The ICAA controller?s will begin assuming control of Balad Sector, followed by Kirkuk Sector, and finally they will assume control of the southern part of the airspace- Ali Sector.  See the website http://ramcc.dtic.mil/iraq.htm, to include the link for the AERONAUTICAL INFORMATION PUBLICATION (AIP) for up to date information on the Iraqi Airspace.

<CONTACT>Sandra  Bellinger , Contracting Officer  , Phone 301-827-7159, Fax 301-827-7101, Email sandra.bellinger@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO CHANGE THE RESPONSE DATE TO APRIL 30, 2007.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This is not a solicitation or Request for Proposals.  At this time, the Government is only seeking information for market research purposes.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are seeking information from interested parties on the formation of a public-private partnership whose goal it would be to establish and maintain a common electronic platform (e-platform) for the exchange of clinical research data (i.e., the data normally collected during the course of a clinical trial), as well as the submission, receipt, and management of regulatory product information.  Such a platform for managing data gathered on medical products all along the regulatory product information supply chain would make use of available bioinformatics technology to systematize the exchange of medical product information beginning in the earliest stage of clinical research through approval to postmarket surveillance, greatly enhancing the efficiency of exchanging medical product information among all interested parties.  Such an effort would also be a big step toward the fulfillment of the President’s National health IT effort, one goal of which is to make medical products safer and more effective than ever before.  

FDA and NIH are seeking information from persons who are interested in participating in and willing to serve as the conveners of such a public-private partnership. The partnership would develop, maintain, and manage a common e-platform and also identify and encourage development of standards relevant to these activities. These functions would support the exchange of data among members of the clinical research community, the exchange of medical product information for regulatory review, and the sharing of data for other, yet-to-be-identified purposes.  The public private partnership that undertakes this effort would (1) transition existing electronic components into the e-platform, (2) work with standards development organizations (SDOs) (e.g., ISO, Health Level Seven) to develop and approve standards, (3) develop and implement additional supporting functions and exchange tools, including the necessary server security requirements, and (4)  oversee management and maintenance of the e-platform.  

A.	PURPOSE
	THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotations (RFQ)) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party’s expense.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. 
	We also are requesting information from small businesses, which includes Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses. All small businesses are strongly encouraged to provide responses to this RFI. This will assist us in determining the potential levels of interest, competition, and technical capability to provide the required services within the Small Business community.  In addition, this information may also be used to assist in establishing a baseline for developing any subsequent potential subcontracting plan small business goal percentages, as necessary.
Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement.  Neither FDA nor NIH will be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.  

B.	DEFINITIONS
e-Platform:  a common electronic platform for the efficient collection, management, and exchange of data related to clinical research, medical product development, and regulatory product submissions.  
Public-private partnership:  an entity convened among government and private organizations with the intent of accomplishing common goal.  Frequently an organization, often a nonprofit entity, serves as the focal point for organizing a public-private partnership. 

C.	GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION
	FDA is in the process of developing an e-platform for the receipt, management, review, and storage of regulatory product information.  The interest of the NIH in the development of such an e-platform is in the interface of drug development and research.  On December 18, FDA and NIH held a public hearing (November 21, 2006; 71 FR 67356) to solicit general views and information from interested persons on issues concerning the electronic submission of product information to the agency.  Among other things, the agencies were interested in hearing the views of, and soliciting information from, interested persons on the feasibility of developing and implementing an all-electronic submission environment, as well as on issues related to developing an electronic regulatory information exchange platform that would be managed and maintained by a third party.  In the notice announcing the Public Hearing, FDA explained that, during the past decade, it has been moving toward transforming all regulatory submissions from paper to electronic means. In addition, FDA and NIH have been collaborating on a number of projects that will automate, thus improve, data sharing between NIH-funded clinical investigators and the FDA. To meet this goal, a series of actions have already been undertaken: 
FDA issued regulations related to voluntary electronic submission of regulatory information and provided a docket listing all submissions that we accept electronically (e.g., electronic records and electronic signatures, 21 CFR part 11; docket 92S–0251; http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/ 92s0251/92s0251.htm)
IFDA issued regulations requiring, or proposing to require, electronic submission of certain regulatory information (e.g., the electronic submission of the content of labeling (December 11, 2003; 68 FR 69009), and manufacturer registration and listing of drug products (August 29, 2006; 71 FR 51275))

FDA issued numerous guidance documents to assist in the submission of various regulatory documents in electronic format (e.g., electronic common technical document, certain premarket applications, and postmarketing information; see http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm#electronic%20submissions) 
FDA issued notices related to electronic submission (e.g., availability of the FDA electronic submissions gateway (http://www.fda.gov/esg/default.htm))
NIH and FDA collaborated with manufacturers  vendors,  healthcare information suppliers, and other interested parties to develop data standards, and to build databases for sharing certain clinical trial information, such as FIREBIRD and Janus (see http://crix.nci.nih.gov/projects/Firebird/ and http://crix.nci.nih.gov/projects/janus/, respectively). 
 The notice announcing the part 15 public hearing also explained that FDA and NIH were considering technological and other feasibility issues related to the electronic submission of premarket applications to FDA, as well as the electronic submission of other regulatory information (e.g., postmarketing information and amendments to applications).  FDA  had concluded that, rather than continue to encourage voluntary electronic submissions—although the agency still encourages such submissions—proactively facilitating electronic submissions by requiring such submissions would help promote the automation of healthcare information, a key goal in the President’s electronic health initiative and part of the long-term Federal goal of ensuring that health information systems are interoperable.  Advances such as these will speed development of new medical technology and provide healthcare professionals and consumers the information they need to make well informed decisions regarding the safe and effective use of medical products, resulting in better health outcomes.
	In their collaborations on FIREBIRD and Janus,  FDA and NIH have also become aware of the potential benefits of having a common e-platform that could be administered by a third party entity or entities (e.g. private or nonprofit entities not otherwise engaged in clinical research activities, as is currently the case with small components of FDA’s electronic infrastructure) with relevant expertise and organizational leadership who could facilitate, coordinate, and manage all of the functions necessary for efficient collection and maintenance of clinical research data as well as pre- and postmarket electronic submissions. For example, a third party entity might perform the following tasks:
Build an electronic platform
Maintain data warehouses
Transition existing electronic data and information repositories to the electronic platform
Work with SDOs
Produce other necessary components to facilitate electronic access and management of information 
Manage and support these functions
	At the Part 15 public hearing, stakeholders had the opportunity to address specific topics and present their views, recommendations, and any other pertinent information related to these issues.  In particular, FDA and NIH asked stakeholders to present input on issues related to the concept and feasibility of an electronic platform that would facilitate the exchange of clinical research information among research organizations and the exchange of regulatory product information between sponsors and the FDA, the role of a public-private partnership in the creation and assessment of such a platform, and the management of the platform after its creation by a private entity or entities with the relevant technological expertise. 
	In this request for information, FDA and NIH are soliciting additional detail about such a plan and are seeking specific input related to issues raised during the Part 15 public hearing. 

D.	QUESTIONS ASKED IN ANTICIPATION OF THE PART 15 HEARING
 In the notice announcing the Part 15 hearing, FDA and NIH asked for input on the following questions:
What are your general viewpoints on a third party entity or entities 	providing services related to such an electronic platform?
What are your views on the establishment of a public-private partnership to initiate formation of an electronic platform?
How do you envision the business model and nature of the third party entity or entities?
What are the necessary attributes and characteristics of the third party entity or entities?
What services could the third party entity or entities provide?
What collaborative efforts on the part of FDA and NIH with a third party entity would be beneficial to establish services?

E.	 ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS RESULTING FROM  INPUT GATHERED DURING AND AFTER THE PART 15 PUBLIC HEARING
What characteristics of the business plan for a public-private partnership would ensure that such an entity would be self-sustaining?
What would the membership of such a public-private partnership look like and how would the engagement of stakeholders be obtained and maintained?
How would international standards be used and extended, and how would prototype infrastructure and applications be developed and extended into production capability?
What would an e-platform look like and how would the interfaces between the research components and the FDA and among various members of the broad research community be structured and supported?
How would data security be guaranteed?
What is the optimum approach to building the electronic platform?
If a modular approach is used, what order of implementation would be best?
How can we contain costs to the government and to stakeholders?
How can we balance benefit and cost for stakeholders who are small businesses?
What is a reasonable estimate of time from concept to implementation?  

F.	DESIRED TECHNICAL GOALS 
The desired technical goal is the development of an e-platform for the exchange of clinical data and the receipt, management, exchange, review, and storage of regulatory product information.

G.	DESIRED BUSINESS INFORMATION 
	The desired business information is how best to create a public-private partnership that is self-sustaining to undertake the goal outlined in section F. 

H.	SUBMISSION OF COMMENTS:  ALL COMMENTS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL.

<DESC>1	INTRODUCTION
The US Small Business Administration (SBA) relies on mainframe based legacy systems to support its mission of providing and servicing small business and disaster loans. These mainframe based legacy systems support the full life cycle (including financial management) of the following loan, loan guaranty and investment programs:
•	7(a)
•	504
•	Disaster (except loan origination)
•	Microloan
•	SBIC
The details about SBA and its loan programs can be found at http://www.sba.gov/.
These mainframe-based loan processing and accounting systems are inflexible and use obsolete technology. These stove piped systems are very expensive to maintain. These legacy systems don’t meet SBA’s current business needs and are very expensive to change to comply with current and future business needs. These systems are not compliant with accepted Federal security requirements, Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 and Financial System Integration Office’s (FSIO, also known as JFMIP) Core Financial Systems Requirements, Direct Loan Systems Requirements and Guaranteed Loan System Requirements. These systems are inefficient, outdated and don’t take advantage of the technological advances. They have been in place for approximately 50 years and significantly contribute to the amount of data reconciliation and manual processes required to do business. 
SBA has initiated a Loan Modernization effort to modernize its Loan Management and Loan Accounting Systems that will support loan origination, servicing, liquidation and financial management for its loan and loan guarantee programs. 
SBA’s vision is to adhere to the following guiding principles to implement modernized system(s):
•	Establish standardized set of data elements across all loan programs.
•	Implement single logical database with the clear separation of loan management data from the financial management data.
•	Implement electronic, real-time or near real-time, streamlined and simplified business processes.
•	Implement single Integrated Financial Management System using COTS that complies with FSIO’s (JFMIP) Core Financial Systems Requirements. 
•	Implement Integrated Loan Management System using COTS that complies with FSIO’s (JFMIP) Direct Loan System Requirements and Guaranteed Loan System Requirements and Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.
•	Implement seamless integration between Loan Management and Financial Management processes.
•	Take advantage of technological advances in Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).
•	Take advantage of processes and systems developed and implemented by other Federal Agencies. For example, Treasury’s Pay.Gov.
•	Implement scalable, reliable, flexible, and highly available system using widely used technologies.
•	Implement appropriate internal controls to ensure the accuracy of data, completeness and consistency of transaction processing, and reporting in accordance with OMB Circular A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Internal Controls.
•	Comply with E-Gov initiatives and use a Shared Service Provider (SSP) for implementation, hosting and application management to achieve economies of scale.
2	OBJECTIVE

<SUBJECT>B -- Test to Detect /Distinguish Sulfas and Antibiotics in Kidney or other Tissue
<SOLNBR>FSIS-13-B-07
<RESPDATE>050407
<ARCHDATE>05192007
<CONTACT>Julian McElveen, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-504-3997, Fax 301-504-4276, Email julian.mcelveen@fsis.usda.gov
<DESC>Request for Information/Sources Sought Synopsis.


The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), a public health regulatory agency of the U.S. Department of Agricultural (USDA), protects consumers by ensuring that meat, poultry, and egg products are safe, wholesome, and accurately labeled.  The FSIS Midwestern Laboratory located at 4300 Goodfellow Blvd, Bldg 105-D, St. Louis, MO, performs regulatory testing for veterinary drug residues in animal tissues from livestock and poultry.  This testing includes screening and confirming drug residues of the antimicrobial classes including, but not limited to, the sulfonamide group and classes of antibiotics such as tetracyclines, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and macrolides. These drugs are either banned or have limited use in food animals.  

The USDA, FSIS is seeking sources capable of providing the agency with a test(s), ideally a single test that is capable of detecting/distinguishing sulfas and antibiotics at the tolerance level in meat and poultry kidney and/ or other tissue. The test will be used to detect controlled or banned residues in food animal tissues as provided under the code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Parts 530 and 556, Title 40 and the Federal Meat Inspections Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act and the Egg Products Inspection Act.  The current test developed by FSIS is the Bioassay for the Detection, Identification, and Quantitation of Antimicrobial Residues in Meat and Poultry Products.  The bioassay is a seven plate agar diffusion assay that can detect and quantitate a range of antibioitic residues in kidney.   The bioassay test is capable of detecting beta- lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and tetracyclines.  While the bioassay is a good screen, it has certain limitations.  The test is not reliable for the quantitation of certain drugs when used in combination, namely, when penicillin G occurs with other beta-lactams, and when neomycin occurs with other aminoglycosides.  
	
Tolerances for drugs in these classes may be found at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=556.


A copy of the current bioassay method is located in Attachment 1 to this Request for Information/Sources Sought Synopsis.

In the solicitation respondents will be asked to supply the FSIS with an automated test system to screen for antimicrobial residue classes in tissues, tissue extracts, blood and/or urine.  FSIS will prefer one test, preferably something similar to a protein chip that screens and identifies the specific residue antimicrobial classes; sulfonamides, tetracyclines, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, cephalasporins, phenicols, macrolides, and other antimicrobials. The test must differentiate each of these drug classes when present in food animal tissue.  The test system must have the capability to perform multi-analyte testing on single individual samples.  The test system must have the ability to detect down to the part-per-billion (ppb) level for select drugs.  

The test system will be validated for use with the tissue matrices used for FSIS regulatory testing, which are currently liver, kidney and muscle tissues or tissue extracts from cattle, swine, poultry and egg products.  In the solicitation respondents will also be asked to provide information on blood and urine tests.  Test system validation results will need to be provided to FSIS.  Where applicable, the validation data must include sensitivity, specificity, limits of detection, limits of quantitation, ruggedness and method uncertainty.  The test must be on a scientifically recognized platform such as a 96-well plate or biochip format and be fully automated for ease of use.  The test system must be such that one person can analyze 25-50 samples within 4 to 6 hours.

Furthermore, the solicitation will require respondents to generate or submit data on a range of drugs from each compound class.  Respondents will submit a description of the protocol used to determine the limits of detection, which should reflect tests run in an appropriate matrix (not water or buffer).  

The solicitation will ask respondents to describe the method used to determine the limits of detection, and the limits of detection for each drug or antimicrobial class tested.  Limit of detection data on fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin and danofloxacin), chloramphenicol, and florfenicol will also need to be submitted.  A complete description of the procedure, along with estimated times required per analysis, will be required.   

This calendar year, FSIS will have run approximately 5,500 kidney bioassay tests.  This number does not include liver and muscle tissues which are partially bioassayed if the kidney is positive.  Due to the number of samples analyzed, FSIS requires the system and equipment to be user friendly and durable.  Although, FSIS cannot identify how many kidney bioassay tests will be needed in the future, approximately 5,500 should be used as a guide if  price estimates are requested. 

In consideration of the description of testing outlined in this sources sought synopsis, if you are a source capable of providing such a test please respond to this synopsis with your company information, business size, and a brief summary of applicable capabilities.   Although other NAICS Codes may be considered, the anticipated code associated with this notice is 325414 and the size standard is 500 employees.  This notice is NOT a request for proposals and the Government does NOT intend to pay for information submitted.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the information they provide.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, the information will be used in FSIS’s assessment of capable sources.  

Responses should be postmarked by 3:00pm EST on May 4, 2007.  Mail three copies of your response to:

USDA, FSIS, OM, ASD, AAS
Attn: Crandall Watson
5601 Sunnyside Ave., 2-L188C, Maildrop 5230

Faxed responses are not permitted.  Questions concerning this announcement may be submitted by 3:00pm EST on April 4, 2007 via email only to Crandall.Watson@fsis.usda.gov, no telephone inquires will be honored.  AUTOMATIC NOTIFICATION:  By registering to receive notification on posted synopses, you will be automatically notified via email of any changes to the project.  To register, select Vendor Notification Service and follow the steps.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Koheras A/S Blokken 84 3460 Birkerod, Denmark for two (2) fiber laser systems.
As the updated light sources for the NIST optical heterodyne measurement system, NIST requires two ultra-stable, single-frequency lasers at 1550 nm with linewidths of less than 10 kHz.  This measurement system is currently used to perform NIST frequency-response calibrations of high-speed optoelectronic photoreceivers from approximately 0 to 55 GHz. The pair of lasers must be configured such that their wavelengths are separated by 300 +/- 50 pm when positioned at the center of their wavelength tuning ranges.  In addition, each laser must have a tuning range of at least 700 pm, which will enable the updated heterodyne system to extend maximum operation up to 110 GHz.  Separate wavelength control via a piezo-tuner is also required to maintain stable closed-loop operation at beat frequencies below 1 GHz. The output of the lasers should each be > 5 mW and linearly polarized to maximize the heterodyne signal.  The lasers should be compact and immune to environmental perturbations.
Based on market research, Koheras A/S is the only source that can fulfill all of the requirements including a critical wavelength tuning range of at least 700 pm, making possible a beat frequency that spans from 0 to greater than 110 GHz.  By contrast, the other lasers can at best produce a beat frequency spanning from 0 to 60 GHz.  
Delivery is required by August 31, 2007.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K). This synopsis is issued for information only. No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement.  Respondents must provide sufficient documentation that address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any questions regarding this notice shall be submitted in writing (e-mail preferred) no later than close of business April 18, 2007. Anticipated award date is April 19, 2007.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT ASSUME THE GOVERNMENT WILL AWARD A CONTRACT OR PROCEED WITH A SOLICITATION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS NOTICE IS ONLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES. 

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Legislation (ASL) is responsible for the development and implementation of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) legislative agenda.     It provides advice on legislation and facilitates communication between HHS and Congress.     The office also informs Congress of HHS? views, priorities, actions, grants and contracts.     ASL is the HHS liaison with members of Congress, staff, Committees, and with the Government Accountability Office (GAO).     The ASL responds to Congressional inquiries about grant awards; notifies Congressional offices of grant awards made by HHS; and facilitates technical assistance regarding grants to members of Congress and their staff. 

The ASL currently uses workflow software to notify Congressional offices when a grant has been approved but has not yet been released.     ASL is in need of workflow software that can meet its need with greater accuracy and efficiency.

The objective is a responsive and cost-effective support to deliver a robust web-based system for all grant tracking and notification activities, including identifying the congressional district of the grant award recipient, reporting and maintaining the grants database records, and tracking grants as they go through the review and clearance process up to and including easy and quick electronic notification of grant awards to Congressional offices.       

The solution needs to accommodate the following requirements and an off-the-shelf product or an off-the-shelf product with a small amount of customization is desired:

1.       More than one user at a time should be able to use the system at once.
2.       A minimum of 2 users will be utilizing the system at all times and that number could increase to 10 depending on the cost of allowing that many users.
3.       Must be able to use data in existing format from multiple operating divisions.     Currently, data is sent in notepad via email using either the IMPACT2 or GATES systems.
4.       Data shall easily be converted into a template notice that includes the HHS letterhead or logo for Congressional offices with minimum or no manual input required from the user.
5.       Grants shall automatically be matched to the correct Representatives and Senators using the address and zip code of the grantee.
6.       Congressional information should be drawn from an up-to-date database of Representatives and Senators and contact information should also include information on their staff.
7.       If any data from the operating divisions cannot be assigned to the corresponding template or to a Representative or Senator, there must be an alert message or error message for the user.
8.       If an emailed grant alert notice does not go through to the email recipient for any reason, the user should be able to print and fax the notice.
9.       The users should be able to import data in large batches and send notices in batches.     In 2005 the Congressional Liaison Office sent out almost 600,000 individual grant notices.     
10.       Each day?s worth of grant notices should be easily printable.
11.       Data should be retained for no more than 2 years and data older than 2 years should be automatically purged.
12.       All data in the current system utilized by HHS should be imported into the new system to provide continuity.
13.       The system shall be tested by the users for a period of time acceptable to the vendor and the users to troubleshoot any problems.
14.       Training for the user and technical support needs to be available for the users.

INTERESTED SOURCES POSSESSING THE REQUIRED CAPABILITIES TO MEET THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS SHOULD SUBMIT A COVER LETTER ALONG WITH A CAPABILITY STATEMENT NOT TO EXCEED 15 PAGES DEMONSTRATING ABILITY TO PERFORM.     

Responses must include the following: name and address of the firm, named central point of contact along with email address; DUNS number; any applicable commercial price list(s); size of business (whether large or small).     If a small business concern, whether they are a small disadvantaged, women owned, veteran-owned, HUBZone, service disabled veteran-owned, 8(a), or an 8(a) HUBZone.     Additional documentation such as company literature and brochures may be included.     If this additional documentation supports the required capabilities it is incumbent to address this reference in the cover letter or other area of the capability statement and indicate specifically how it addresses the capabilities sought. A mere referenced website is unacceptable for purposes of this announcement and will not be considered or reviewed. Capability statements must be submitted via email to clint.druk@psc.gov.     No statements delivered by mail, fax, or by hand shall be accepted under any circumstances.     Responses are due no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time, April 20, 2007.

<DESC>Request for Information:  The Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO) offers a complex nationwide healthcare system composed of 152 medical centers and their respective microsystems to veterans who meet the criteria for care.  To continually evaluate and strengthen this healthcare system, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates a complex Quality Management and Improvement program that is supported by data abstracted from identified medical records using an external peer review format. This opportunity is composed of three major elements that intertwine to provide reliable and valid data for quality of care evaluation and improvement:  development of the data points to be collected based on VHA need, current literature, strong medical evidence, external comparators; collection of the approved data by licensed or credentialed professionals (e.g. Registered Nurses, Registered Health Information Technicians, etc.) at the various VHA Medical Centers and via remote access to the medical records obtained from that Medical Center; scoring and aggregation of that data with reports outlined in the format required by the VHA.  Underlying all of these processes is a very strong expectation of data security and maintenance of patient confidentiality that meets or exceeds the VHA requirements. Interested firms should provide company profile including qualification statement (i.e., Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Veterans-Owned or Women-Owned Business, or if firms have a GSA Federal Supply Schedule).  The detailed qualifications statements from interested sources are to be submitted via email to Ms. Anna Lythgoe at Anna.Lythgoe@mail.va.gov by April 13, 2007.  Please reference RFI number VA-101-07-RI-0276.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for the purpose of obtaining market research only.  No proposals are being requested nor accepted under this synopsis.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, will use information obtained under this  synopsis to develop an acquisition strategy to meet the combined needs of the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) and the U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) Programs.  The intent of this synopsis is to access industrys (large and small business concerns (including 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) capab ility and interest in performing medical construction projects using, job order contracting (JOC), design-build and design-bid-build criteria to meet the needs of the AFMS and MEDCOM Programs.  Typical projects under the AFMS and MEDCOM Programs are antici pated to be primarily associated with renovation of existing facilities, but may also include major repair and new construction.  Work may include, but is not limited to, replacement, restoration or modernization of hospitals, clinics, medical administrati on buildings, ambulatory health facilities, medical warehouses, medical labs, biological engineering labs, dental clinics, veterinary clinics, wellness centers and any other buildings connected to/associated with the health facilities, and all facilities o n three medical installations and their annexes (Fort Sam Houston, TX;  Fort Detrick, MD;  and Walter Reed Medical Complexes, Washington, DC, Silver Springs, MD and Bathesda, MD.  Both programs may involve restoration and modernization projects such as HVA C, medical gas, plumbing, electrical, elevators, building envelope, fire protection, interior renovation, terrorism/force protection, and exterior site and systems work such as utilities infrastructure, road ways, side walks, parking lots, landscaping, irr igation, and etc.  The geographical area of the AFMS and MEDCOM Programs is anticipated to be Nationwide, including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam.  The combined AFMS and MEDCOM program need is anticipated to be $700 Million for a five year period. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction with a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542; and a Business Size Standard of $31 Mill ion.  It is anticipated that the program need for both AFMS and MEDCOM, may be met through the use of a multiple award process to establish various Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.    The multiple award approach is  anticipated to result in the establishment of qualified pools of contractors (each pool may have 3 to 6 firms) that compete for award of a task or job order to perform the medical construction project.  The total number of MATOCs and JOCs anticipated to b e awarded, and the size and type of any set-aside solicitation will be determined based on the responses received from this sources sought synopsis.  The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among contractors for work to be performed under a multiple award approach.  Interested Offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis by completing the Market Research Questionnaire which may be accessed at http://www.swf.usace.army.mil/pubdata/MED/Surveys/default.aspx until 4:00 P.M. Central St andard Time on 24 Apr 2007. Completed questionnaires will be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy to support this program.  The Point of Contact for this action is Kenneth Carleton, Construction Contract Branch, Fort Worth District Cor ps of Engineers, at 817-886-1084 or Kenneth.carleton@swf02.usace.army.mil.   The market research survey seeks to identify industrys experience, past performance, and capabilities to execute this progra m.

<DESC>Background Statement and Purpose

The Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority has the responsibility to operate safely in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs).  To facilitate aircraft operations, trained, certified air traffic controllers have to direct aircraft entering, departing and moving through the Iraqi airports? airspace and its environs.  Currently, the Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority (ICAA) and the US Government, through a contract with DynCorp International, are training Iraqi personnel to handle the Air Traffic Control (ATC) functions. At this time, the Iraqi trainees have not acquired the required experience necessary to manage the air traffic control functions in all locations.  At the present time, the United States Air Force (USAF) provides air traffic services in most locations, with Iraqi trainees beginning to assume some functions.  

By April 2007, the ICAA controllers will initiate a three phased process to assume the primary air traffic control responsibilities in the high altitude enroute airspace, and later, assume primary control of other parts of the Iraqi air traffic control system. The current structure of the Iraqi Enroute airspace is broken up into three Areas:  Baghdad North (Kirkuk Sector), Baghdad, (Balad Sector) and Baghdad South (Ali Sector).  The ICAA controller?s will begin assuming control of Balad Sector, followed by Kirkuk Sector, and finally they will assume control of the southern part of the airspace- Ali Sector.  See the website http://ramcc.dtic.mil/iraq.htm, to include the link for the AERONAUTICAL INFORMATION PUBLICATION (AIP) for up to date information on the Iraqi Airspace.

The ICAA?s current ATC trainees are partway through their training to perform air traffic control functions in accordance with ICAO SARPs.  To complete training, the trainees require real-time experience and on-the-job-training (OJT). More beginning trainees will enter the training program to perform air traffic control functions in accordance with ICAO Standards in the expanding responsibilities of the ICAA. 

The purpose of this contract is to enter into an agreement with a contractor to provide training courses, and OJT leading to ICAA ATC personnel becoming compliant with ICAO SARPs, and provide ATC Services in accordance with ICAO SARPsat various ATC and Airport facilities throughout Iraq.

During the life of this contract, the following Governments and Organizations may place task orders through the Contracting Officer under this contract:  Department of State and subordinate organizations, Department of Transportation and subordinate organizations, the Department of Defense and subordinate organizations and the Government of Iraq.

The Contractor shall be responsible for ATC at task order designated facilities during instruction and training of Iraqi ATC personnel.  When Iraqi ATC personnel attain compliance with ICAO SARPs the Contractor shall certify their compliance to the ICAO SARPs and provide supporting documentation to the ICAA and the Contracting Officer?s Representative.

The Contractor personnel provided under this contract shall have the knowledge, proficiency, and qualifications necessary to operate/supervise the facilities the Contractor is providing training in as well as the ability, knowledge and proficiency and qualifications to be an ATC instructor in accordance with ICAO SARPs.

<SUBJECT>A -- High Temperature Thermocouple
<DESC>BEA has developed a High Temperature Irradiation Resistant thermocouple (HTIR-TC) that is a breakthrough in the field of high temperature measurement; overcoming the two most critical thermocouple issues plaguing high-temperature operations—signal drift and instrument longevity.  Its accurate measurement of temperatures between 1100 and 1700°C is important to safe, efficient and economical operations and BEA’s HTIR-RC is specifically designed for operating reliably in high-temperature radiation environments.  Its benefits include: 1) safety and efficient use in high-temperature manufacturing processes, 2) durable and reliable at high temperatures, up to at least 1700°C , 3) resistant to irradiation in nuclear power reactors, 4) moderately priced,  5) easily installed and 6) available in a variety of configurations.

For more technical information on the HTIR-TC please access:  http://www.inl.gov/factsheets/docs/htir.pdf
A short video of this R&D 100 Award candidate is also available on www.inl.gov 
Contact Mr. Gary W. Smith.  A potential licensing opportunity exists with BEA, the prime operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).

<SUBJECT>R -- Knight Journalism Fellowship Program
<DESC>Knight Journalism Fellowship Program

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the CDC Foundation, Atlanta, GA, 30303. (This is a non-profit organization.) The proposed contract is for the collaboration of the CDCs Office of Enterprise Communication and the CDC Foundation to establish a fellowship program for journalists that will raise the quality of medical and public health reporting in the United States and to help fill critical gaps in training for journalists by exposing them to public health problems, policies and practices.  This program will establish a higher standard of public health reporting and will ultimately benefit the health communities.  Background: Public health has been described as the point where science and politics meet.  CDC is the nations’ premier public health agency, responsible for promoting health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury and disability.  

CDC’s approach to health is quite different from other organizations. Clinical medicine promotes a view of the world focused around an individual, the patient.  CDC looks at entire populations, and through surveillance of population data, CDC emphasizes a quantitative approach to problem solving and decision making.  This approach has the potential of being misunderstood by those who are not familiar with the approach or with statistics.  When those people are journalists, it can be a problem that filters throughout the population.  The resulting situations can be harmful to health at individual and national levels.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Statement of Work--This program will provide journalists with a better understanding of epidemiology and public health at the international, national, and local levels;
--Provide a better understanding of the major public health issues of the day;
--Help improve journalists skills in writing about public health research and programs and in framing complex issues in new ways; and 
--Will serve to help CDC gain a greater knowledge and understanding of the perspectives of journalists in writing about crucial health issues.

The Knight Journalism Fellowships at CDC will be offered annually and consist of a one to two week boot camp type of training that provides a science-based, action-oriented introduction to population-based health.  

The fellowships will provide specialized training in population-based approaches to health and include work with eminent researchers and scientists at CDC, investigating an outbreak with CDC’s disease detectives, conducting research, and seeing policy in action in state, county, or local health departments.

Scope of Work--
PHASE I -- (Year One) -– The CDC Foundation and CDCs Office of Enterprise Communications staff will work together to:
--Establish procedures for applications, interviews, and selections and publicize the fellowship opportunity.  Select Fellows to begin program in 2007 according to timeline established within one week of award.    
--Determine program timing and content and instructors.  Recruit and arrange the best personnel and experiences at CDC and externally.  Arrange mentoring relationships with CDC scientists and researchers based on Fellows’ request.  
--Carry out program being mindful of late-breaking opportunities that may arise to provide special experiences.  
--Evaluate the program through participant evaluations and instructor evaluations;
--Plan a one week Knight Refresher/Reunion for June or July 2007 for past Knight Fellowship classes to enhance their knowledge and skills in writing public health articles and media releases.  
--Write narrative report on annual program activities.

PHASE II  – (Year Two through Four years) 
--Establish procedures for applications, interviews, and selections and publicize the fellowship opportunity.  Select Fellows to begin program in 2008 through 2011 according to timeline established within one week of award

<SUBJECT>99 -- Sole Source Notice to Oregon State University from USDA/NRCS Plant Material Center in Corvallis, Oregon
<DESC>The USDA/NRCS Plant Material Center in Corvallis, Oregon would like to continue its long standing relationship with Oregon State University. Below, is justification, according to FAR 6.303-2 for obtaining the authority to purchase incidental supplies and services for the Plant Materials Center from OSU.  1 - The Plant Materials Center seeks to purchase from OSU supplies and services including machinery, equipment operators, water, fuel, fertilizer, pesticides, shop services, student labor (summer), facility maintenance and library services.  2 - The supplies and services will be used carry out the goals and mission of the USDA/NRCS Plant Materials Center in a cooperative and cost effective manner.  3 - To carry out our goals and mandates, NRCS has determined that it will need to acquire through procurement the previously stated services and supplies for a total estimated cost of $41,400.  4 - The Corvallis NRCS Plant Materials Center is located on OSU property and has leased farm land and building space from OSU for decades. The yearly charge of $1 for building space is obviously cost effective.  Being located on the OSU Hyslop Farm, the Plant Materials Center staff is free to use OSU specialty farm equipment whenever needed thus saving valuable time and money for our program. OSU is able to meet all of the specifications needed by the Plant Materials Center including building space, on-site irrigation wells, shop services, facility maintenance and equipment operators for the same cost charged to other OSU facilities and programs.  5 - The land lease rate charged to NRCS by OSU is less than similar farm land in the area. NRCS is able to buy local supplies under this OSU purchase order for much less than we could purchase on our own because of major quantity discounts afforded the university. The Plant Material Center is also able to get field inspections done for free because of our association with the farm, which saves hundreds of dollars each year. Beside the overall cost advantage offered by OSU, the technical expertise of OSU faculty and staff is invaluable.  6 - Because of our long standing relationship, techniques and equipment have been developed over the years that make farming small areas such as ours very cost effective.  These economies will not be available with any other vendor.  Because of these reasons, it is my recommendation that we issue a Purchase Order to OSU to pay for the supplies and services listed in Paragraph 1.

BACKGROUND

Hospital-Affiliated and Stand-Alone outpatient clinics and Infusion Centers in the United States for the characterization of drug and biologic usage and practice patterns of chemotherapeutics and other infused agents.

The statutory provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA, Section 406), Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 310.305, and Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 314.80 require FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of regulated marketed products. FDA's authority to fund research projects is set out in section 301 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA 42 U.S.C. 241).

The Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE) contributes to this effort by evaluating drug risks and promoting the safe use of drugs by the American people – a key component of FDA’s mission.  In 1999, the Task Force on Risk Management’s “Report to the FDA Commissioner” and the HHS Office of the Inspector General’s “Report to the FDA Commissioner” both identified the need for greater postmarketing pharmacovigilance for prescription drugs.  In response to these reports, FDA devoted greater resources to the area of postmarketing safety and has expanded the roles and responsibilities of OSE within CDER as well as FDA’s Center for Biologics to meet these needs for prescription drugs and biologic therapeutic products. 
 
FDA currently has several tools available to address postmarketing safety issues.  These tools include a passive reporting system for adverse events related to drug and biologic therapy; several complementary drug utilization databases; and indirect access to US claims-based health encounter data for pharmacoepidemiology studies. To strengthen and complement these resources, FDA is interested in identifying existing commercially available data sources that capture data on patients exposed to drugs and infused therapeutic products that are administered outside of traditional retail and inpatient hospital pharmacy healthcare settings, e.g., outpatient clinics, infusion centers, or home infusion services in the US.  

At present, the FDA has the ability to estimate post-marketing drug exposure via access to data on outpatient prescription drug use including longitudinal patient-level data, healthcare practitioner prescribing patterns in office-based physician practices, and inpatient drug use based on hospital discharge billing data.  However, no usage data are currently available to the FDA for drug products that are administered outside of these settings of care due to limitations in data collection with the available resources.    

FDA is interested in exploring existing commercially available database systems that capture data on patients exposed to drugs and infused therapeutic products that are administered outside of traditional retail and inpatient hospital pharmacy healthcare settings.  FDA is not interested in database systems under development.  Additionally, FDA is interested in organizations that own the data as well as a means to access data.  

Definition of Infused Therapeutic Products, Outpatient clinical practice settings

Infused therapeutic products are defined as drug or biologic products that are administered parenterally.  Outpatient clinical practice settings exist beyond the traditional retail and inpatient hospital pharmacy healthcare settings, e.g., outpatient clinics, and home infusion services.

DESCRIPTION 

FDA is interested in identifying sources that capture data from, (1) hospital affiliated and stand-alone outpatient clinics and infusion centers that have existing data systems that will provide a denominator, or context, for understanding passive adverse events reported to FDA, (2) for modeling drug risk based on usage patterns, and (3) for calculating patient-based reporting rates for drugs and infused therapeutic products administered in these settings.  

In general, FDA is interested in,
Systems that can provide any of the following information:
Demographic usage information (age, gender) of patients, number of unique patients exposed; 
Indications for  use;
Strength and dosing information;
Setting of administration, e.g., infusion centers, home infusion, oncology centers, hemophilia treatment centers, and dialysis centers;
Concomitant medications or devices;
Co-morbid conditions;
Lot numbers for biologic products;
Trade name and active ingredient name;
Prescriber specialty;
Systems that are nationally representative, or those including at least a multi-center or multi-state population or network.
Systems that can provide HIPAA compliant data.   

INFORMATION REQUESTED

Interested organizations that have relevant information are invited to submit a statement that describes their available product and its applicability to FDA’s needs. These submissions should contain cost estimates for FDA to access the data. Submitted information could include a discussion addressing some or all of the evaluation criteria (shown below), described in a comprehensive review of the currently available data resource product:

The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the products -- however software support is a separate expense and represents an ongoing annual expenditure. PeopleSoft products are the basis for much of ILMS. The PeopleSoft products currently used by ILMS include: PeopleSoft Inventory, PO, CRM Support server license, Object Studio, Balanced Scorecard, Enterprise Warehouse, Supply Chain Management, Activity Based Management, GL, and AM modules A full description of the software maintenance services that are required can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for Mythics.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from Mythics, the firm that is certified to resell software support by Oracle/Peoplesoft. Software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS. ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>

in some cases State, income taxes on salaries earned abroad while working for the U.S. Government.

CONTRACTOR-MISSION RELATIONSHIPS 
 
   (a) The contractor acknowledges that this contract is an important part of the U.S. Foreign Assistance 
Program and agrees that his/her duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibilities which this entails.  
   (b) While in the Cooperating Country, the contractor is expected to show respect for the conventions, customs, and institutions of the Cooperating Country and not interfere in its political affairs.
 
   (c) If the contractor's conduct is not in accordance with paragraph (b) of this provision, the contract may be terminated under General Provision 16 of this contract.  The Contractor recognizes the right of the U.S. Ambassador to direct his/her immediate removal from any country when, in the discretion of the Ambassador, the interests of the United States so require.
 
   (d) The Mission Director is the chief representative of CDC in the Cooperating Country.  In this capacity, he/she is responsible for the total CDC Program in the Cooperating Country including certain administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract and for advising CDC regarding the performance of the work under the contract and its effect on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program.  The contractor will be responsible for performing his/her duties in accordance with the statement of duties called for by the contract. However, he/she shall be under the general policy guidance of the Mission Director, and shall keep the Mission Director or his/her designated representative currently informed of the progress of the work under this contract.

SOCIAL SECURITY, FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND FOREIGN EARNED INCOME

     (2) The contractor shall be provided a contribution of up to 50% against the actual costs of annual life insurance not to exceed $500.00 per year.
 
     (3)  Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts.  The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas.  In such case, the contractor would be eligible for contributions under paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) as appropriate.
 
     (4)  Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid.  On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.
 
     (5)  A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this provision.

Basis for Award

In determining best value, paramount consideration shall be given to technical merit (applicant qualifications and reference checks) rather than to cost.  In cases where applicants are determined to be essentially equal, then cost may become the determining factor.

CLASS JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL
AND OPEN COMPETITION


Upon the basis of the following Justification, the class of procurements described below should be issued other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority cited herein.


JUSTIFICATION


1.	Contracting Office: This class justification and approval is prepared by the Headquarters Procurement Team, U.S. Marshals (USMS).

2.	Nature of the Action: Class justification and approval for other than full and open competition under FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.

3.	Description of Supplies Services: The equipment required is one Gyro-Cam TS Triple Sensor.  The estimated price is $260,000.00.                                                                                                         


4.	Statutory Authority: Appropriate statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 © (1).  

5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above: A fully functional Infrared Dual Sensor and zoom capable camera system are instrumental in helping the USMS complete its mission of air surveillance. The Gyro-Cam Systems Dual Sensor Camera, which is in use on all USMS Cessna 206 aircraft, has proven adequate in meeting the USMS needs.  The Gyro-Cam System is the only system that is compatible with previously installed mounting and operating systems onboard the USMS Cessna 206 aircrafts. 

6.	Efforts to solicit potential sources: A sole source combined synopsis/solicitation will be issued on FEDBIZOPPS. The contracting office/requesting office will evaluate all responses received.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices: The contractor has submitted data that the system to be procured has been sold in substantial quantities to Federal, State and local government entities.  A price comparison will be performed between the current submitted price of their Gyro-Cam system and that of past prices offered to the USMS and other governmental/ non-governmental entities, for both identical and similar items.



8.	Market Survey:  Recent procurements for the Infrared Dual sensor have been sole source to Gyrocam Systems. This is because market research has shown that the Gyro-Cam System is the only system that fits the external camera mounts and operates on the internal operating systems installed on all USMS Cessna 206 aircraft.  This has been verified by Richard Hunter, Chief Inspector, TOG, Air Surveillance Branch. Although past market research has indicated that there are several companies producing digital imagery collection systems, these systems are not compatible with the USMS Cessna 206 mounting and operating systems. 

9.	Additional Support: None.

10.	Source List – Gyro Cam Systems

11.	Future Competitive Plans: The USMS will continue to perform market research in an attempt to find a zoom capable camera that meets the agency’s technical requirements.

INTRODUCTION:  The Office of Device Evaluation’s Division of Cardiovascular Devices (DCD) at the FDA is responsible for regulating cardiovascular devices and in doing so is responsible for reviewing about 40% of the Pre-market Approval (PMA) submissions received by ODE annually.  These reviews are undertaken by DCD scientists who make up approximately one quarter of the ODE review staff.  Devices employed for correction of heart failure is a major component of the Division’s workload. This workload is rapidly increasing due to technologic developments expanding the application of complex new heart failure technologies. This new technology has not only significantly increased the population of candidates for treatments previously demonstrated as effective in open-operations, but has also introduced new modalities to correct the defects in a less invasive, percutaneous manner. This is illustrated in the astronomical number of submissions related to heart failure treatment submitted to the Division for review.  A total of over 1000 such submissions were reviewed during the past year which included 720 IDE applications; requiring a 30-day decision, 69 PMAs, and 720 510(k)s.  Case Western University has the experienced staff that are experts in the field of heart failure, are board certified in cardiology and have experience in clinical pharmacology.  Additionally, the experts at Case Western have been found to have participated in many of the changes in the conduct of heart failure and are familiar with the clinical trials conducted for the associated new technology.  All of these characteristics give Case Western the credentials and experience to be able to perform the work requested.  WORK TO BE PERFORMED: A) Objective:  To assist The Office of Device Evaluation’s Division of Cardiovascular Devices (DCD) in reviewing and regulating cardiovascular devices.  Devices employed for correction of heart failure is a major component of the divisions workload.  The new technology has not only significantly increased the population of candidates for treatments previously demonstrated as effective in open-operations, but has also introduced new modalities to correct the defects in a less invasive, percutaneous manner.  B) Scope of Work:  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the consultant shall serve as an expert clinical reviewer for heart failure device applications, provide expert preclinical and clinical reviews, provide scientific and technical leadership and guidance in the area of heart failure medical devices used in both diagnosis and treatment of all types of heart failure pathology.

The Government intends to make an award to a single offeror who can provide all items identified and as specified herein. Successful offeror shall be the responsive responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Price and price related factors (2) Delivery schedule. Inquiries and information received after the established deadline shall not be considered for this particular acquisition. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Only written responses will be accepted. E-mail responses must be in MS Word, Excel or PDF format. Technical and/or administrative questions must be submitted in writing to Charlotte.Laughlin@dhs.gov or Ella.Chapman@dhs.gov.  All responses to this notice shall be received no later than April 13, 2007, 4:00 p.m. Central Time (CT).   

The following justification and approval is provided for other than full and open competition for this purchase. 

1.   Agency and Contracting Activity:  The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Grants and Training, the Preparedness Directorate, Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP), Anniston, Alabama, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition.

2.   Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved.  The CDP requested approval to solicit for a specific "brand name" purchase, of Motorola Astro Digital XTS5000 Model III, 800 MHz Portable Radios for the CDP Operations Center.  The Motorola radios are essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  These radios are required to replace obsolete radios currently in use in the CDP Operations Center.  

3.   Description of Supplies/Services.  This requirement is for the purchase of Motorola Astro Digital XTS5000 Model III, 800 MHz Portable Radios. Due to compatibility issues with the on-going upgrade of the Calhoun County Emergency Management Agency's (CCEMA) 800 MHz communications system, the CDP is required to upgrade its existing radio equipment (XTS3000 and 5000 portable radios and XLT 5000 base/mobile radios). These radios will allow the CDP to continue to be compatible with the local emergency management community. The "brand name" Motorola is the only known source that can provide the equipment.  

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (5) as stated in FAR 6.302-1, entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements".

5.  Demonstration that the Nature of the Acquisition Required Use of the Authority Cited.  In 2005 the CDP emergency communication system was upgraded with the Motorola XLT 5000 Consolette Base Station, 800 MHz emergency services radio system. In addition, the CCEMA has similarly upgraded to operate in a related structure. The Motorola Astro Digital XLS 5000 Model III portable radios are necessary to ensure the critical interoperability and communications between the CDP and the CCEMA community during emergency operations.  The CDP's radio system uses and takes advantage of the Calhoun County Emergency Radio system and infrastructure.  The CDP benefits from the Calhoun County FCC license, frequency and access to other emergency services.   

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  Efforts have been made to identify other contractors for this requirement by synopsizing this requirement in FedBizOpps; the single government point-of-entry (GPE) for Federal government procurement opportunities. All interested Motorola dealers/distributors will be afforded the opportunity to participate in the acquisition.

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.  The Contracting Officer hereby determines that the cost to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable based upon sufficient competition obtained by posting the combined synopsis/solicitation to FedBizOpps and the vendor's commercial product price list.

8.  Description of Market Research.  Upon initial receipt of this requirement, a market survey was conducted to determine if this requirement could be solicited among small businesses under the GSA Schedule.

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.  
As an integral member of the Calhoun County emergency management community it is essential that equipment used by the CDP be compatible with the equipment used by the local emergency management community. To do otherwise would jeopardize the CDP's ability to interact and communicate effectively with the local emergency management community.  If the CDP cannot effectively communicate and interact in a time of crisis, it would significantly impact safety and human life.

10.   A Listing of the Sources, if any, that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.  The only source considered for this procurement action is Motorola and its dealers/distributors. No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition.

11.  A statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition of supplies or services are required.   No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition will be taken, as the Motorola "brand name" Astro Digital XTS 5000 Model III portable radios is the only known system capable of satisfying this agency's requirement.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(I)	Technical Capability of Proposed Item to Meet Requirements.
(II)	Past Experience and/ or performance.
(III)	Delivery Item on time frame specified.
(IV)	Price
Applicant’s Proposal will be evaluated first under Factor (i) which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria. Under this factor, applicant’s proposal will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.
Only those proposals which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii), (iii) and (iv). In the second step of evaluating those proposals under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is significantly less important than Factor (i). In the third step of evaluation those proposals under Factor (i) and (ii) to be technically acceptable, Factor (iii) is significantly less important than Factor (ii). In the fourth step of evaluation those proposals under Factor (i),(ii) and (iii) to be technically acceptable, Factor (iv) is significantly less important than Factor (iii).
a)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted. Submitted proposals technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 

b)  A proposal that receives a rating of acceptable on past performance is one that demonstrates little anticipated risk in the areas of quality of the product, and customer satisfaction.  Submitted proposals should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate acceptable past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies and subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement.   

(II) PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided as an attachment to the quote.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  

Proposals that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any submitted proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Thus, the Contracting Officer may determine it is an unsuccessful proposal when compared to others proposals.

Submitted proposals will be evaluated for PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:
NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation. Applicant’s proposal has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon applicant’s proposal past performance.
SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the applicant’s proposal past performance.
MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the applicant’s proposal past performance.

(III) It is significantly important that the “20 modified ISO container for weather research on Marine Environment” be delivered on the time as specified on “ISO Container Quote” document (ISO Container Quote.doc).     

You may submit your quote by e-mail (doris.p.turner@noaa.gov), or by fax (303-497-3163).  Quotes must be received on or before close of business April 20, 2007.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) at Orlando, FL intends to procure on a sole source basis the DARWARS Ambush! Training System with BBN Technologies at Cambridge, MA.

 This action will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.)  BBN Technologies is the original developer of the Ambush! modification to a commercial gaming engine and holds all of the current developmental tools, licenses and agreements with the game and model developers (intellectual property and software licensing) necessary to complete the model development within the projected schedule.   

The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price contract to make software changes and transition technical support of the DARWARS Ambush! training system.

Ambush! training is being used daily at over 200 locations by units in preparation for and during deployments in support of the Global War on Terror.  The new contract will continue development of new vehicle models to replicate Rapid Equipping Force and Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Office (JIEDDO) and Air Force Protection Battle Lab initiatives that are already being used in the field.

All MacDill AFB alarm systems are monitored by the 6th SFS and are consolidated into a single Advantor monitoring panel for efficiency of space, maintence, and overall operations. That said, all alarm systems to be monitored by 6th SFS must be Advantor systems to ensure compatibility with existing equipment and processes. In addition to having the alarm system equipment and alarm system relocated and installed, SCIF and armory accreditation require 24-7 monitoring of the alarm system, with an associated ability to respond to alarm activations within 10 min. 

Market research was conducted for the purchase of this alarm system and Advantor Systems Corporation is the only contractor found able to supply this item as we require. If no response to this notice is received by 3:00pm EST on Monday, April 16, 2007, the award for this alarm system for the new OSI building will be made to Advantor Systems Corporation.

Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design, (2) materials, (3) components, (4) performance characteristics and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Descriptive literature must be (1) identified to show the product which it applies and (2) received by the date and time specified in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  

2.  Factor 2 – Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror’s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror’s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror’s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable proposal will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

In evaluating an offeror’s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror’s proposal and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms, and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

The information provided should reflect similar type contracts for the same or similar type products under an indefinite delivery type arrangement.  

The offeror shall provide: 
a.	A list of contracts, preferably three, commercial or government that have been performed within the last five (5) years.  This list shall include:  point of contact, address, telephone 
number, dollar amount of contract, performance schedule and a brief description of the services provided.
b.	A list of any “significant problems” encountered for the contracts reported in response to paragraph (a) above.  General examples are:  shortages, overages, damage and misshipments.  Include also a brief description concerning how these problems were handled and remedied.
    
References may be contacted as part of the evaluation process.

3.  Price
If a proposal has been determined technically acceptable, the Government will then evaluate the proposal for the lowest price.  

The Contracting Officer has determined that there is a high probability of adequate price competition for this acquisition.  Upon examination of initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer’s opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required.  However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price.

Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all proposals.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The following DLAD provisions are hereby added in full text:
DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests.
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity’s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

NOTE:  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registration may be obtained calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.bpn.gov.  

All responsible small business concerns may submit a proposal that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

Request for Proposal (RFP) due date and time is April 24, 2007 – 2:00PM local time.

Local clause 52.111-4131 states: Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice. Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342). (a) Unless the  contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistic s Center Gate ( Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 ho urs and 2100 hours. These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays. On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I- 5). Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained. All commercial vehicles will be searched. The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post. The Contractor must also allow additional time for c ommercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis. If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as poss ible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority. On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5in clearance) will require a time stamped se arched- label to gain access to North Fort Lewis. Searched- labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate. Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5in in height and that they will req uire access to North Fo rt Lewis. The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a -searched- label. The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, i ncluding drivers of su bcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis. (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane e xcept at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta. During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate . All passengers in the  contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes. Once the Fast Access Gate P rogram is fully implemen ted, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate. The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes. (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only t hrough the Logistics Cent er Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.- Local clause 52.111-4132 states: -a. Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to pe rform work under any contr act, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis. A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requi res access to Fort Lewis m ore than twice per week. Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Libert y) Gate or the Logistics C enter Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed). The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time. A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if th e contractor participates i n the Fast Access Gate Program. The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program. b. The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background ch eck (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis. The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identific ation card. If the CHBC is not  adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee. If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee. If a fast access identification  badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identific ation badge, the Government may,  in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee. c. If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under t he contract), the contractor shal l return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change. If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately not ify both the FAGPC and the Contra cting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day. An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government i nstallation because he/she does n ot have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract. The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are i ssued or returned, with or withou t advance notice to the contractor. Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract. d. Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or t heir employees. If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such l oss, theft, or reproduction is disco vered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered. e.

The identification badge shall not be used for acc ess to any Government installation exce pt for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued. f. The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The fi nal invoice will not be considered prope r for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for. g. If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor w ill be notified by the Contracting Office r as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.- Local clause 52.111-4004 states: -In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce defin ition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.- Quoters are required to submit completed copies of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 and its ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their quotes.
