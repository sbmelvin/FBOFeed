<DESC>This is a presolicitation notice:  The USDA, APHIS has a requirement for an IDIQ contract for A-E services for the AMS, Cotton Program at various leased facilities throughout the southern United States.  Because of the proprietary design of the control sequence and the highly specialized, tight specifications for the cotton classing laboratory, the Government will not be obtaining competition for this effort.  Transfer of the design requirements for the laboratories in enough detail to assure a new team can design a facility that would perform to the current requirements with technology that is compatible across all facilities is not feasible.  Therefore a non competitive award is anticipated to the small business Fanning, Fanning and Associates for this effort.  This IDIQ scope covers design plans, specifications and cost estimates for new construction, renovations and repairs; preparation of studies, reports and engineering recommendations; and mediation on behalf of the Cotton Program to address issues related to the design and implementation of HVAC systems and any problem issues that arise with the Lessor?s contractors for the AMS Cotton Classing facilities.  The current intentions will require three new facilities over the next two to three years.  The design of the cotton classing facilities and refinements have been related to the location of equipment relative to another component in addition to a control sequence that has been refined to optimize improved control over the valves resulting in more uniform and stable conditioning.  The control sequence could be considered a propriety item since it was developed by FFA and has been in their design for at least 10 years.  The specifications for cotton classification have tightened over the years and it would be very difficult for a new engineering consulting firm to design a building that would perform at the current requirements.  Our requirements cannot be relaxed as the demands of the industry continue to increase with the development of new technologies in the cotton spinning industry that require the best information for forecasting fiber performance in the textile mill processing.  This effort will be procured using FAR Part 36.  A base year with four option periods is anticipated.  Task Orders will be issued against the IDIQ for individual effort.  Total maximum contract value over the life of the contract including the option years will be $3,000,000 with a $1,000,000 maximum for any one year period.  The NAIC for this procurement is 541310 ($4.5 million).  See Government-wide Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Directorate of Procurement intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with DRS Unmanned Technologies, Inc., 6300 Columbia Street, Mineral Wells, TX 76067 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1) and FAR 6.302-1.  The purpose of this procurement action will be for CLS to maintain the Neptune II systems to be delivered in 2007 and for the procurement of additional VCUAS capability.  After evaluation of the responses received to the RFI issued 05 Oct 06, USSOCOM has determined that no other supplier can provide the Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for existing Neptune II Unmanned Aircraft Systems or can design, develop, test, and manufacture Vehicle Craft Unmanned Aircraft System (VCUAS) systems within the timeframe called out in RFI to satisfy USSOCOM requirements.  Moreover, no other supplier responding to the RFI identified a system capable of operating and landing in the saltwater environment.  Based on results of the RFI and USSOCOM knowledge of the UAS market place, DRS UT, Inc is the only firm with the existing logistic support and manufacturing capability that is mature enough to meet VCUAS requirements within the established timeframe.  DRS maintains proprietary ownership of the engineering and maintenance technical order data rights to Neptune II.   Given the level of technology readiness of other contractors, the Government would be required to spend significant resources and considerable time for other suppliers to reach comparable support and manufacturing levels.  The DRS Neptune II is the only system available to meet the VCUAS requirement for operating in a maritime environment from small platforms.   The Government anticipates awarding one contract related to this announcement for a period of approximately five years with a potential maximum of up to $50,000,000.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency?see Note 22.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Ms. Kim DeBois-Sousa, Contracting Officer, Phone (813) 826-7077, Fax (813) 826-7504, Email Deboisk@socom.mil

MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:    1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees.  2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:   •	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D. •	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof 	of insurance. •	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the 	prime contractor including contract number and term). •	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year 	covering the previous two years.

If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at Government expense. Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshal’s Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.

Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractor’s expense. 4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee: 	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List. 	b.    is illegally present in the United States. c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant. d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information. 	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations. 7.

Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel. 9.

Offerors shall submit past performance and experience information. The offeror must provide the information requested for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offeror’s submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offeror’s.  Past performance information shall demonstrates how well the Offeror satisfied its customers on previous contracts and shall  include name(s) for points of contact, telephone numbers, email address, contract number (if !  any), contract price, period of performance, years performed and any unique qualities of the contract.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego, CA intends to award a firm fixed price contract to SAYR Resources Inc., 10923 Indian Trail, Suite 101, Dallas, TX on a sole source basis.  The purpose of this action is to procure forty (40) each of the Octal Digital Signal Processor (DSP) Part Number 72-8R1-222-B000.  In addition, this is an End of Life purchase of the DSP.    The DSP original manufacturer was Blue Wave Systems Inc., and subsequently purchased by Motorola.   Motorola discontinued the manufacturer of the DSP in 2001.   Since 2001, SAYR Resources has repaired the DSP circuit cards and has provided several new cards which have functioned exactly as the discontinued card.    Use of any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs associated with re-design, development of a prototype, and recertification to meet a series of shock, vibration, and environmental tests for a one time buy.  These duplicated costs are not expected to be recoverable through competition.  Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. See Note 22.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334418 and the size standard is 500 employees

Communication - The Contractor shall furnish sufficient equipment to have communications with the Government either by using radio frequencies designated by the Project Inspector or by providing a radio to the Project Inspector. Seed Bucket(s) or Hopper(s) - Sagebrush seed presents unique problems due to its bulkiness and its tendency to bridge in the seed bucket.  In addition, it is anticipated that a majority of the sagebrush seed will have a high moisture content which causes seed to compact, clump, and bridge even more severely.  Therefore, seed bucket(s) or hopper(s) shall include a mechanical agitation system to prevent the seed from bridging in the bucket or hopper.  Equipment that cannot perform the specified work shall be modified or replaced by the Contractor.  Equipment shall be equipped for carrying seed with an approved distribution mechanism complete with release, shutoff, and spreading device, which can be calibrated for spreading seed at the prescribed rate in a satisfactory manner and uniform pattern.  Seed bucket(s) or hopper(s) shall include lids, which fasten securely to prevent seed from blowing out. Seeder Calibration - The Contractor shall calibrate seeding equipment prior to application on the project.  The Government will supply seed for calibration.  However, the seed may not be available until approximately two days prior to the approximate start date of the project.  Seed used for calibration shall be recovered for use on the project. Seed - The seed will be furnished by the Government at the location stated in the Detailed Specifications.  Contractor shall load and transport seed from the pickup point to the operational loading sites and shall be responsible for its protection from loss or damage due to weather, rodents, insects, theft, or any other hazard.  Any seed damaged or lost, while in the custody of the Contractor, will be replaced by the Government, and actual cost to the Government for replacement will be deducted from payments due the Contractor.  All unused seed shall be returned to the pickup point by the Contractor or nearer destination, if so directed, upon completion of work or termination of the contract.  All empty seed bags shall be tied in bundles of 25 bags each and returned to the Government by the Contractor. Seeding Operation - Rate of seeding - Seed shall be distributed at the rate stated in the Detailed Specifications, or as directed by the Contracting Officer.  Some seeding rates may be slightly reduced due to availability of seed.  The following is a list of the locations and quantities for the required seeding: Description/Pounds of Seed/Estimated Acres Desert Unit Mix/55,907/37,271 Mountain Unit Mix High Elevation/2,736/4,275 Mountain Unit Mix Mid Elevation/22,928/8,785 This is a 100% set-aside for small business.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SOLNBR>5260
<RESPDATE>010807
<CONTACT>Phyliss Schlegel, 609-485-4380
<DESC>Amendment 3 follows: The FAA is expanding the AFTIL market survey to seek responses from qualified, small businesses.  If you have previously responded to this market survey as either a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged - 8(a) or a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) entity, you are not required to resubmit.  If your firm meets the small business size standard (NAICS 541330, $4.5 million) and has the requisite corporate capabilities to perform the tasks outlined in the attached Statement of Work (SOW), you are invited to submit the following items: -Completed Business Declaration Form, (attached) -A capability summary of not more than 8 pages that addresses corporate capabilities specific to accomplishing the work described in the SOW and transition of existing contract in a seamless manner.  The summary should include information on how contractor personnel will be supplied, i.e., currently available as employees of the prime, subcontractor arrangements, etc.   Potential sources are cautioned that no further announcements may be made if a competitive small business set-aside is accomplished.   Responses are due by 2 p.m., local time, January 8, 2007 and may be directed to FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Attn:  Phyliss Schlegel (AJP-7551), Atlantic City International Airport, NJ  08405.  Submissions shall be marked "AFTIL Small Business Market Survey Responses" and shall include one (1) original and three (3) copies. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Amendment 2 follows: This is the second amendment to AFTIL Market Survey. 1.  The following changes should be made, pen and ink, to Paragraph 9 of the Draft Statement of Work:      a) The abbreviation (SME) is deleted from the Computer Aided Design (CAD) and 3D Real-Time Modeling Specialist labor category;      b) AT Specialist (AA):  is corrected to read AT Specialist: and      c) The Administrative Assistant labor category is deleted. 2.  There were several questions posed regarding the predecessor contract. Question:  Who was the contractor and are they eligible to compete?   Answer:  The contract was awarded to Joseph Sheairs Associates.  This SEDB firm subsequently became part of L-3 Ilex.  As such, they are a large business and no longer a viable competitor if the FAA sets this aside for SEDBs or for any small business category. Question:  Are the current employees available as part of any potential transition? Answer:  Arrangements between employees and their employers is on a free will basis.  The FAA is not able to speak to the current employees' availability. Question:  What was the contract number, start date, expiration date and value? The Contract # was DTFA03-00-D-00022, Delivery Order 0002.  The Delivery Order started in February, 2001 and is scheduled to expire in June, 2007.  The total dollars obligated to date are $6,977,759.37; however, this order also covered work for Flight Support Services (FSS).  FSS was recently re-competed and awarded as a separate contract and is not included in the current SOW.  It is estimated that 35% of the funding on Delivery Order 0002 was used for FSS. Question:  When do you expect to award the follow-on contract? Answer:  This is a market survey/sources sought announcement, with the single purpose of discovering the capable competition available in the SEDB and SDVOSB business community. Timelines for the follow-on contract have not been established.  3.  Question:  Our firm has experience in the tools mentioned but we do not have expertise related specifically to FAA or its operational needs.  Is this knowledge of FAA component essential?   Answer:  Demonstration of the requisite corporate experience in the tools is essential, regardless of whether the work environment was FAA, NASA, military, commercial customer, etc.  4.  Amendment 1 requested that SDVOSB firms include a certifying letter from the Small Business Administration.  This is not required.  However, SDVOSBs can establish their eligibility to compete in this category by either providing:   A letter from their local Veterans Administration (VA) showing that the owner is a service connected disabled veteran with a rated disability; or   A copy of the rating letter received from the VA or the military service awarding the rating after redacting the percentage, reason for the rating or other person information not necessary for the certification. 5.  A request was made to change the North American Industry Code Standard.  Upon review, the FAA is satisfied that the Engineering Services, 541330, is appropriate for the work contemplated. -------------End of Amendment 2----------------------------------- The market survey is hereby expanded to include Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  SDVOSBs possessing the requisite capabilities to accomplish the tasks in the SOW work are invited to respond by 2 p.m. local time on December 12, 2006 and shall provide all items requested in the original announcement, including a copy of a letter from the Small Business Administration certifying their status as an SDVOSB.   The due date for submissions from SEDB/8(a) firms is unchanged, i.e. due by 2 p.m., local time, December 6, 2006. All submissions shall be delivered to: 	Federal Aviation Administration  	William J. Hughes Technical Center 	Engineering Services Acquisition Sub-Team (AJP-7551) 	Attn:  P. Schlegel 	Atlantic City International Airport, NJ 08405 Submissions shall be marked "AFTIL Market Survey Responses" and must include one (1) original and three (3) copies.   --------------End of Amendment-------------------------------------------- This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.2.4.  It is a survey, not a solicitation, to determine interest and capabilities of interested Small Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB).  A predecessor contract, #DTFA03-00-D-00022, Delivery Order 0002, was originally awarded to a SEDB firm.  The FAA has an ongoing need for some, but not all, of the tasks that were in this order.  This market survey is being conducted to aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside competition to SEDBs.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. The North American Industry Code Standard for the work comtemplated is 541330, Engineering Services.  The size standard is $4.5 million. A draft Statement of Work for Airport Facilities Terminal Integration Laboratory (AFTIL) support services is attached.  The FAA has a need for these requirements for the next five years. Interested companies are required to provide: -A copy of a letter from the Small Business Administratin certifying their status as a SEDB/8(a) firm. -Completed Business Declaration Form, (attached) -A capability summary of not more than 8 pages that addresses corporate capabilities specific to accomplish this work and transition of existing contract in a seamless manner.  The summary should include information on how contractor personnel will be supplied, i.e., currently available as employees of the prime, subcontractor arrangements, etc. Submission of these items is requested by 2 p.m. local time on December 6, 2006.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of responses to this announcement.  Brochures alone will not be considered sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities.  Responses will not be returned.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is a sources sought announcement so no solicitation exists; please do not request one.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page and it is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for release.  If a determination to set this requirement aside for SEDBs is made, failure to respond to this announcement may result in exclusion of offeror from completition since the competition may be released to qualified, responding SEDBs. Inquiries relative to this announcement are to be submitted in writing only via e-mail to Phyliss.Schlegel @faa.gov.

The successful offeror will provide a Contractor-owned and operated facility capable of housing up to 250 USMS detainees charged with federal offenses, detained while awaiting trial or sentencing, and 100 ICE detainees awaiting a hearing on their immigration status or deportation. The facility shall be located within 75 miles of the Lloyd D. George - U.S. Federal Courthouse, 333 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Suite 2058, Las Vegas, NV 89101.  The successful offeror will be required to provide all personnel, services, equipment, material, supplies (to include full medical services and all transportation services within 250 miles of the facility) required for management and operation of a secure detention facility. 

Offeror will be required to provide information to the Government to ensure compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq., and the implementing regulations at 40 C.F.R.

Not later than March 30, 2007, the offeror shall submit a Phase I Survey conducted in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), E-1527-05, "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessment: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process."

The identification of on-site wetlands should include and on-site reconnaissance level survey/report by a qualified wetlands specialist, the National Wetlands Inventory map for the project area, and an identification of hydric soils on the proposed property. The analysis of potential impacts to threatened and endangered species of special status should include a site reconnaissance report identifying potential habitat or presence of protected species (plant and animal) lists. Failure to submit the Phase I Survey by March 30, 2007 shall preclude that site from being considered for this procurement.

All information submitted as a part of the Phase I Survey shall be considered non-proprietary and, at the discretion of the Government, be made public during the Scoping process under NEPA or at any other appropriate time. 

To be considered, the offeror submitting the proposal must clearly demonstrate at the time of proposal submission it has corporate experience operating secure detention facilities over a continuous three-year period as of the date the RFP was issued. Note, point ventures will be considered as long as one partner meets the corporate experience requirement. Multiple proposals from one offeror will not be accepted.  OFDT intends to award a firm-fixed price contract for an estimated term of 20 years (base period of five years and three (3) five year option years). The Government reserves its right to negotiate the terms of the contract. Interested parties are advised that Past Performance and Experience will be significant factors in the evaluation of offers and award selection shall be made on a Best Value basis.   Consideration will be given for new construction, expansion, renovation or use of an existing facility.

OFDT estimates issuing the solicitation on or about May 1, 2007.  All interested parties requiring further information should send an email to Lori.Ray@usdoj.gov.

<DESC>Arcata Associates, Inc (Arcata/UNITeS) is seeking sources for the acquisition of various components used in the construction or upgrade of custom engineered Video Teleconferencing (ViTS) and Voice Teleconferencing (VoTS) Systems at various National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) centers nationwide.  Based on the information received, Arcata/UNITeS intends to solicit and award; at its sole discretion, one or possibly multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for these items.	 The items to be covered by the agreements will include both Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) products and some custom produced products.   The COTS products include, but are not limited to, items such as video cameras, flat panel TV monitors, amplifiers (audio and video), control systems, switchers, mixers, microphones, equipment enclosures, cables, connectors, codecs, recorders, speakers and various brackets, mounts or other hardware required to install these customized systems into dedicated rooms.   The custom products include, but are not limited to, items such as camera or speaker enclosures and shelves, podiums (with controller functions), junction boxes and tabletop accessories. These products are generally available from a variety of manufacturers and distributors.   Since the components specified have all been previously utilized; the necessary integration of hardware and software has been performed and proven in daily use.  Alternate or substitute products may be considered; however, for the items to be considered, the offeror would have to provide an evaluation unit to Arcata/UNITeS at no cost for integration and test purposes before the product could be included as a CLIN.  Equipment manufacturers include companies such as AMX, AutoPatch, Clearone, Crown, JVC, NEC, Panasonic, Polycom, Shure, Sony and many others.  A draft/sample listing of products is being provided under this "Sources Sought" Notice as an EXCEL file, though a formal listing of products and quantities will be provided with the solicitation.	Because of the visibility of this effort and the necessity to meet agressive delivery schedules, the successful offeror(s) may be required to stock certain products enabling overnight delivery, with a quick turnaround required for all items after release of a delivery order. Stock and delivery requirements will be detailed in the solicitation. Additionally, because of the short product life cycle and volatility of market availability for these products there will be a requirement for technology refresh during the IDIQ period of performance.	This technology refresh is not expected to occur more often than semi-annually, but may occur as often as quarterly based on market conditions.  Please provide via email or US Postal Service your statement of interest and a brief (one page or less) company overview to the responsible buyer listed below no later than December 26, 2006.  No telephone or oral contact will be allowed.  Your statement of interest should identify the point of contact including name, address, telephone number, and email address of the person who should receive the solicitation, once released.  Arcata/UNITeS anticipates release of a solicitation within thirty days; however, this Sources Sought Notice is not a solicitation and there is no guarantee that a solicitation or contract award will follow.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Management Analysis, Inc. (MAI), 2070 Chain Bridge Road, Suite 550, Vienna, VA 22182. The purpose of this contract is to provide support services for the Agencys competitive sourcing (A-76) activities.  MAI will assist the Agency through various implementation phases which will complete the FY 2006 and 2008 Competitive Sourcing Program activities to meet the Presidents Management Agenda (PMA) and assist the Agency with obtaining a green rating on the PMA scorecard.  These activities include continuing to provide post-competition review support semi-annually (quality assurance evaluation activities for previous competitive sourcing studies), conducting preliminary planning reviews for upcoming planned A-76 competitions, assisting with completion of OMB cost reports, compiling and completing the annual Fair Act Inventory, reviewing and updating the Agencys A-76 website and assisting the Agency in completing its scheduled A-76 competitions.  The estimated period of performance is for approximately two years with three one year options.  MAI has been the primary supporting consultant for AHRQs competitive sourcing program, including program management and execution of competitive studies in Fiscal Years 2003, 2004 and 2006.  In this role, MAI has gained an extraordinary understanding of the AHRQ competitive sourcing strategic goals and the organizational and operational structure of AHRQ.  Having been the supporting consultant for the planning and competition phases for all of the AHRQ FY03, FY 04 and FY06 studies, MAI posses extraordinary background information and familiarity with the functions studied, substantially facilitating MAIs ability to support AHRQ both in the conduct of the next round of studies and in continuing their work on the next (post-award) phases of the competitive sourcing life cycle for the previous FY03, FY04 and FY06 studies.  MAI, during the last four years, assisted AHRQ with other HHS elements to remain at the cutting edge of OMB Circular A-76 and other competitive sourcing efforts in many functional areas that have not been considered for possible outsourcing feasibility in the past, in any other Federal environment.  Interested parties should email a capability statement that is tailored specifically to the requirement mentioned above to the Contracting Officer at Jessica.Alderton@ahrq.hhs.gov no later than 1:00pm on January 2, 2007.  All responses will be considered by AHRQ.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service is conducting market research to identify companies with an interest and capability to provide a mail stowage and retrieval system for its delivery fleet of Long-Life Vehicles (LLV).  This will be done in conjunction with implementation of a new Flats Sequencing System (FSS) program whereby large envelopes, magazines, catalogs and circulars will be sorted for letter carriers who must now manually sequence the mail before leaving the office for their routes.  As the FSS program is implemented, the plan is to purchase mail stowage and retrieval systems for up to 18,000 LLVs.  Deployment would start July 2008 with delivery completed by July 2010. 

The LLV mail stowage and retrieval system will be used to assist in loading and unloading mail in the delivery sequence of the route.  The system should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate all mail trays (letter/flats) and parcels, and light enough to have only minimal impact on the load carrying capacity of the vehicle.   An average daily volume of mail handled by a letter carrier will consist of approximately 18 trays of mail (Letter/FSS flat trays) and 12 parcels.  During peak volume periods, the daily volume of mail could be 25% to 50% higher on an infrequent basis.

The objective of this notice is to identify potential sources as well as to determine what products are in the marketplace that can meet our requirement.  This is a request for preliminary information only and is not a solicitation to purchase equipment or services.  

Please email the following information to either address below:

1.  Your company name, address, telephone number(s) and email
    address.
2.  Name of your point of contact.
3.  Brief description of your product/design capability.

An industry conference will be hosted by the Postal Service on January 30, 2007.  The purpose of the conference is to identify and discuss requirements for purchase of the mail stowage and retrieval system.  If you are interested in attending the conference, please follow the instructions on the attached conference documents. 

To be identified as a potential source, you will still need to email your company information to Delores Waters or Mary Ellen Young (email: maryellen.young@.usps.gov, Phone 215-931-5103, Fax 651-675-1518), whether or not you plan to attend the conference.

<DESC>U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District, Hurricane Protection Office (HPO)Contracting Division. Description: THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE. This Notice provides to the potential proposers a broad overview of this procurement.  The Notice explains the overall problem the Government desires to remedy through this procurement, explains the Governments approach to the procurement, providing gener al information on the method of selection, and outlines how the Government plans to make key technical data available to the proposers. PROBLEM:  The Government seeks, through the solicitation and award of a Design Build Contract, a remedy for a hurricane protection related problem in the New Orleans area.  The problem is the protection of three canals (London Avenue, 17th Street, and Orleans Avenue ) from the storm surge from Lake Pontchartrain.  This includes design and construction of pumps, with stand alone auxiliary power supply capacity, sufficient to evacuate the drainage fed to the canals.  The project design criteria for the pumping capacitie s of the three canals is: London Avenue, 8,980 cubic feet per second (cfs); 17th Street, 12,500 cfs; and Orleans Avenue, 3,390 cfs.  This work is authorized under Public Law 109-234, wherein Congress authorized $530,000,000 to modify the 17th Street, Orlea ns Avenue, and London Avenue Drainage Canals and install pumps and closure structures at or near the lakefront. Should available funding prevent a complete problem solution, the Government may utilize the available funds to provide the most cost effective partial solution. APPROACH AND SELECTION:   Confident that the Design Build delivery approach will save time, and generate holistic, innovative solutions to the problem above, the Government intends to procure Design Build services by means of the Corps of Engineers Two-Step method (FAR Part 36.3).  In step one, the Army Corps of Engineers will issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ), and from respondents to that RFQ, select, based on qualification, a short list of three to five firms.  In step two, the Corps of Engineers will issue the Design Build  Request for Proposals (RFP) to the three to five short listed firms and request their proposed technical approach, and associated price.  The Government will select a single technical approach on Best Value. To encourage innovative solutions to the stated problem, the Government will not prescribe a design but rather provide key technical data to the shortlisted firms, along with design criteria.  The Corps of Engineers has two AE firms under contract, develop ing pre-design engineering and environmental data.   This data will be made available to proposers for their use (if they wish) and to verify that there is at least one feasible engineering solution to the problem.  The task of selecting the best technical  approach and optimizing that approach is left to the proposers.    The Government however, has no particular bias toward any particular technical approach studied by any of its contractors.   It remains the responsibility of the proposer to collect any ad ditional data they determine necessary to develop their technical approach. While the RFP selection criteria have not been fully developed, at least the following Factors are currently under consideration:  Technical Approach, Management Team, Experience, and Price. The NEPA Process is also an important element of the project. The Government is interested in using proposer input to improve its RFP, and if time permits, there may be the issuance of a draft RFP, followed by a pre-proposal conference, and then the issuance of the final RFP to the shortlisted firms. The contract type, whether lump sum, cost based, or fee based has not yet been determined. SHARING OF KEY TECHNICAL DATA:    As was described above, the Government will select a shortlist based o n qualification prior to collection of all project engineering data and completion of the design criteria.  After selection of the shortlisted firms, and prior to issuance of the RFP, the Corps of Engineers may engage in exchanges of information with the s hortlisted firms in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  In these exchanges, technical engineering and environmental data may be made available and discussed.  It is anticipated that attendees to these exchanges may include some loca l stakeholders and environmental regulators.  These exchanges may be considered when the Government is finalizing its engineering and environmental reports and the RFP. RESPONSE: Please indicate interest as a potential offeror (prime or joint venture partner) to this planned procurement by responding to Mario Carrete via letter or e-mail at: 		U. S. Army Corps of Engineers                 Contracting Division 		ATTN:  Mario Carrete 		HPO, Rm 167 		PO Box 60267 		New Orleans, LA 70160-0267 		Mario.Carrete@mvk02.usace.army.mil The Government invites your comments and concerns to this planned procurement, as described above.  The Government values and will consider all input received, however, we do not intend to respond directly to each comment.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Notice of Intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Demountable Cargo Containers Manufacturing
<DESC>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of Intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Demountable Cargo Containers Manufacturing (Dry Freight Containers/Connex Boxes).
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Demountable Cargo Containers Manufacturing (Dry Freight Containers/Connex Boxes).  According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply these classes of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA's 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Sarah Ayers, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Sarah Ayers, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 205-6413; by FAX at (202) 205-6390; or by email at sarah.ayers@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA's 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA's regulations at 13 CFR 121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months. The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding system.  The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Demountable Cargo Containers, Manufacturing, (Dry Freight Containers/Connex Boxes). North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 336212.  
The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of NAICS code within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Business Opportunities.

<SUBJECT>59 -- FPI Production in FSC code 5975
<DESC>This notice announces a decision by the Board of Directors for Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) regarding FPI?s production in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 5975 - Electrical Hardware and Supplies.

A provision of the guidelines allows for FPI to exceed a specific product?s expansion threshold in cases of public exigency, such as a national defense emergency.  The guidelines require that FPI receive a specific order or request from the Department of Defense (DoD) or Executive Branch officials for this provision to be invoked.  Upon invoking this provision, the guidelines allow that ?increased sales resulting from national exigencies will not be considered a violation of the guidelines ceiling in the year in which they occur.?

On December 11, 2006, FPI received an official request from the Department of the Army?s Program Executive Office - Command, Control, and Communications Tactical at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey.  The correspondence requested FPI to fulfill DoD?s need for communication mounting assemblies in FSC code 5975.  FPI?s FY 2007 sales ceiling for FSC code 5975 is $26.9 million.  Based on year-to-date sales, the additional work represented by the DoD request would cause FPI to exceed the sales ceilings for FSC code 5975.

The DoD request states that ? To date, UNICOR is the only known, qualified manufacturer of the FSC 5975 Mounting Assemblies.? 

FPI presented its Board of Directors with a request to invoke the guidelines? ?national exigency? provision.  In light of the military?s critical need for this item, FPI staff requested its Board to invoke the ?national exigency? provision for FSC code 5975.  On December 14, 2006, FPI's Board of Directors officially approved this request.  Accordingly, FPI?s sales in FSC code 5975 may temporarily exceed the guidelines ceiling without constituting a guidelines violation.

It should be noted that the national exigency provision of FPI?s guidelines is temporary.  It does not authorize FPI to utilize the higher sales level as a future production baseline.  FPI is not certain how long the current exigency will last due to the ongoing military operations.  While the requested production levels are deemed to be on a temporary basis, at this time, DoD does not know how long the requirement for additional production in this FSC code will last.  At a minimum, however, it is expected that increased production levels as a result of DoD?s expanded needs will continue as long as the Army is involved in overseas conflicts.

Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI?s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, DC 20534. Attention: FPI Board of Directors.

<SUBJECT>53 -- FPI Production of Hardware FSC codes 5341 and 5342
<DESC>In furtherance of the FPI Board of Directors? directive to pursue the creation of inmate jobs without reliance on mandatory source, a notice was published in the December 21, 1998 edition of the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) regarding FPI?s production of products for the Federal government on a competitive (non-mandatory) basis.  The notice stated that the Board of Directors had granted approval for FPI to competitively bid on products for which it did not rely on its mandatory source of supply.  Under this procedure, FPI would not follow the public involvement guidelines process established by 18 U.S.C. 4122(b) which is required for new products FPI offers as a mandatory source.  FPI is required to publish a notice of its intentions to competitively produce a product purchased by the Federal government.  

This notice announces FPI?s intentions to produce hardware, which would include brackets and mounting plates, as a subcontractor to a Department of Defense supplier on a competitive basis and not use its mandatory source status.  These products encompass all hardware classified in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 5341 - Brackets, as well as, the items classified in FSC code 5342 - Hardware, Weapon System.  

Once a product is sold competitively by FPI, it remains a competitive product and will never be added to FPI?s Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product.  FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time nor seek from its Board of Directors to expand production of the product by invoking the guidelines process at some later date.  It has been previously determined by the FPI Board of Directors that whatever share of the market FPI acquires on a competitive basis will be deemed to be a reasonable share of the market within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 4122(b)(2).  Sales of products manufactured under this procedure will be tracked and recorded separately by FPI as is the case for subcontracting and services.

Interested parties have a right to comment or raise questions with FPI?s Board of Directors.  All written correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534. All comments received will be provided to the Board of Directors.

<SUBJECT>56 -- FPI Production of Roofing Materials -  FSC code 5650
<DESC>In furtherance of the FPI Board of Directors? directive to pursue the creation of inmate jobs without reliance on mandatory source, a notice was published in the December 21, 1998 edition of the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) regarding FPI?s production of products for the Federal government on a competitive (non-mandatory) basis.

Under this procedure, FPI would not follow the public involvement guidelines process established by 18 U.S.C. 4122(b) which is required for new products FPI offers as a mandatory source.  FPI is required to publish a notice of its intentions to competitively produce a product purchased by the Federal government.  

This notice announces FPI?s intentions to produce roofing materials, which would include down spouts, guttering, roof scuppers, cricket flashing, coping, ridge cap, etc., as a subcontractor to several roofing contractors on a competitive basis and not use its mandatory source status.  These products encompass all roofing materials classified in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 5650 - Roofing and Siding Materials.   


FPI would not pursue any business directly with federal customers.  The only exception that may occur would be if the Bureau of Prissons requested to deal with FPI as the prime contractor.  If involved as a prime contractor with the Bureau of Priosons, FPI would do so on a competitive basis and would not invoke mandatory source.

Once a product is sold competitively by FPI, it remains a competitive product and will never be added to FPI?s Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product.  FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time nor seek from its Board of Directors to expand production of the product by invoking the guidelines process at some later date.

Only those Large Account Resellers (LAR) under GSA Schedule 70, Information Technology (IT) Schedule, Special Item Number (SIN) 132-33, Perpetual Software Licensees will be considered for award. The performance period of this contract may not extend beyond the Contractors GSA Master Contract performance period.  All performance under this contract must be completed by no later than the end date of the final year of the Contractors GSA contract, unless the Contractors Master contract has been modified to extend the period of performance or it is renewed. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is CM1301-7-RQ-0005.  The solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14. The full text of clauses referenced herein may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far/. The requirements will be fulfilled using the Simplified Acquisition procedures, Part 13 of the FAR, and the test program authorized in FAR 13.5 for acquisitions of commercial items not in excess of $10 Million. This acquisition is 100% set aside for small business. The NAICS code is 423430 and the associated small business size standard is 100 employees. The Government intends to award up to three (3) firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) delivery order contracts for server and client licenses of an Electronic Communications and Messaging software product and associated services. The software product must contain a fully integrated desktop client and product suite which includes: email, calendar, task, contacts, instant messaging, global address, web access, and directory services (if required). The associated services will include all maintenance (patches), version upgrades, and technical support. The Government intends to make an award of an IDIQ delivery order contract(s) covering the following specific products: Microsoft solution, Lotus solution, and Sun solution.  These products represent over ninety percent (90%) of the DOC user and entertaining additional products would create a substantial duplication of cost to the department that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling Department of Commerce (DOC) requirements. The Justification for Approval is available upon request. The DOC intends to order the minimum quantity from each contract awarded for the purpose of an internal evaluation of products and services to determine the degree of fitness in meeting internal requirements of each of the above solutions within the DOC current computing environment. Quoters are free to propose one or more than one of the three product solutions however; the Government anticipates it will continue to exercise additional orders and options with one solution provider for one product solution. Note, the Department of Commerce further reserves the right not to make any award if that action is in its best interest after concluding the review of the quotes, and is subject to availability of appropriate funding. All interested LAR Quoters shall provide a quote for the following line items: BASE PERIOD-Effective Date of Award through twelve (12) Months Thereafter: Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001-Global Enterprise Licenses (Client and Server) Agreement for electronic communications and messaging software product and associated services CLIN 0002-Maintenance of product and technical support; CLIN 0003-Support for Installation/Testing of Software for ten (10) consecutive business days; OPTION PERIOD I-13th Month through 24th Month: CLIN 0004-Global Enterprise Licenses (Client and Server) Agreement for electronic communications and messaging software product and associated services CLIN 0005-Maintenance of product and technical support; OPTION PERIOD II-25th Month through 36th Month: CLIN 0006-Global Enterprise Licenses (Client and Server) Agreement for electronic communications and messaging software product and associated services; CLIN 0007-Maintenance of product and technical support; OPTION PERIOD III-37th Month through 48th Month: CLIN 0008-Global Enterprise Licenses (Client and Server) Agreement for electronic communications and messaging software product and associated services, CLIN 0009-Maintenance of product and technical support; OPTION PERIOD IV-49th Month through 60th Month: CLIN 0010-Global Enterprise Licenses (Client and Server) Agreement for electronic communications and messaging software product and associated services; CLIN 0011-Maintenance of product and technical support.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) monitors humanitarian conditions, assesses disaster impacts, and coordinates ongoing disaster assistance efforts overseas.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  To fill its mandate to respond to disasters around the world on behalf of the U.S. Government (USG), DCHA/OFDA projects itself overseas in a variety of ways.  First, DCHA/OFDA maintains five permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office in the following locations:  San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; Pretoria, South Africa; and Kathmandu, Nepal.  Second, in countries where DCHA/OFDA has a large humanitarian response portfolio, it establishes a Program Office within the USAID Mission or U.S. Embassy.  Third, in the event of major disasters, DCHA/OFDA may deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to the affected country.

The Overseas Administration Team (OAT) was created to meet the need for administrative support and intervention as OFDA's  presence in the field grew following the opening of these regional offices.  As more staff were permanently deployed to support emergency programs in Africa and Asia, OAT's role in administrative intervention prior to and following deployment of staff has become more significant.  OFDA now has 12 locations in the field that are directly supported by OAT.  The team consists of three members:  the Administrative Officer for Field Operations (as the Team Leader) and two Administrative Support Coordinators.

In 1999, OFDA instituted a program of contracted personal services contractors (PSCs) who could provide short term, on-call assistance to the office as the need arose.  This program, called Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS), has grown from an initial group of 12 to a potential pool of up to 75 contractors.  The management of this program became part of the OAT portfolio.  

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  

The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The Overseas Administration Team (OAT) is part of the OPS Division.  This team is the primary liaison between the administrative offices in USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies where OFDA personnel work and OFDA/Washington.

In addition to maintaining a database with information on the availability, skills, and previous OFDA experience for all contracted RATS, OAT provides administrative and personnel support to RATS and helps OFDA program officers choose the most qualified RATS for specific tasks.

OBJECTIVE

The Administrative Support Coordinator (ASC) will provide administrative support to OFDA overseas operations at USAID Missions and Embassies worldwide. The ASC will also support the surge capacity program (RATS).

The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML-7012. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14 dated 11/22/06. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. The RML has a need to construct a custom chip from the manufacturer that will contain a Salmonella genome in the context of open reading frames (ORFs), intergenic regions, and non-coding DNAs. This chip shall be unique and specific to RML. The RML has a need to purchase 1 lot of these custom chips from Affymetrix, lot size shall be approximately 90 (ninety) chips. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  No other chip of it?s kind exists. These gene chips are a one-time-use-only consumable and will be consumed in RML experiments.  This is a 6-8week, one time work effort, where the final product will be 1 lot of RML custom salmonella gene chips, at ~90 chips per lot.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix.  The chip is high density,  at 106 per cm2 (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip? was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip? probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip? probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip? probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip? probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-14.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339111 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Trace Explosive and Narcotics Detector, which shall include training and installation.

Background

The mission of NIST, as mandated by Congress, is to develop and promote measurements, standards, and technology to enhance productivity, facilitate trade, and improve the quality of life.  Reliable standards are needed to test the performance and effectiveness of trace explosive and narcotic detectors, which protect the public and infrastructure of the U.S.  Currently, NIST has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art microanalytical instrumentation and ion mobility spectrometers for trace explosives and narcotics detection. This program is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of organizations and agencies that use such detectors. A critical requirement for NIST is to conduct research on the performance capabilities of emerging trace detection systems being deployed to rapidly scan people and other items passing through security screening checkpoints for the presence of explosives or narcotics. Trace detection systems rely on the removal, collection and preconcentration of particles that are collected from a surface by swipe sampling. The swipe is inserted into the detector where the sample residues are thermally desorbed for detection by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS).  As part of the NIST research program, new standard reference materials and procedures for calibration and evaluation of detector systems are being developed. For this purpose, NIST has several trace explosive/narcotics detectors that represent current technology. A new technology is emerging that utilizes gas chromatography and IMS detection in one system. This allows an improved separation of analytes before detection, enhancing selectivity and decreasing the rate of false positives in field use. 

***All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Trace Explosive and Narcotics Detector, which shall meet or exceed the following required specifications: 

 General Requirements:  (1) The system must utilize gas chromatography (GC) to separate the analytes; (2) The detection system must be based on ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) or differential ion mobility spectrometry (DMS); (3) The system must be capable of simultaneous detection of both positive and negative ions which allows for detection of both explosives and narcotics listed below within the analysis time specified below.

Specific Requirements: (1) The following analytes must be detectable: cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol-tetranitrate (PETN), trinitrotoluene (TNT), dinitrodimethylbutane (DNMB), nitroglycerin (NG), triacetonetriperoxide (TATP), cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine.  Additional capabilities are not a requirement, but will add competitive value to the proposal; (2) Sampling and analysis time must be less than 20 seconds per sample; (3) Documentation must be provided regarding system sensitivity (limits of detection (see note 1)) to the analytes named above.

***Note 1- The limit of detection (LOD) is commonly accepted as the smallest amount of a particular substance that can be reliably detected in a given type of medium by a specific measurement process. The analytical signal from this amount must be high enough above background variations to give statistical confidence that the signal is real, so the LOD is normally defined as the amount of substance that generates an average signal three times higher than the standard deviation of the background signal. In IMS, background variations are very much smaller than the measurement repeatability (standard deviations) of reference samples, so samples at strictly defined LODs would exhibit a false negative rate of about 50 percent (assuming that the alarm thresholds were set at the LODs). To define an LOD where a positive alarm would be expected reliably (over 90 percent of the time), we must factor in the measurement variability. We define this value (LOD90) as the amount of substance that generates a mean signal three times greater than the standard deviation (s) of the individual measurements. The conversion from measurement units (a.u.) to amount of substance (mass) is via the slope of the sensitivity curve (S). We also assume that the mass of analyte in the blank is zero.

LOD90 = 3 ? s ? S, where S = delta (mass)/ delta(a.u.)

***Note 2 - The Detector Challenge (DC), where the false negative rate should be negligible, is arbitrarily defined as the amount of substance that should generate a signal twice the DL90, so that,

DC = 2 LOD90

SUBJECT:  Amendment to Include Referenced Attachments to Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for an Administrative Support Coordinator in Washington, DC.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i)entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  

The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  

If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).



ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9  Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  

(Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 267, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives Systems (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
